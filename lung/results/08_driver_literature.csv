23884408,ASPA,10.1074/jbc.M113.487553,N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) promote growth and inhibit differentiation of glioma stem-like cells.,"Metabolic reprogramming is a pathological feature of cancer and a driver of tumor cell transformation. N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) is one of the most abundant amino acid derivatives in the brain and serves as a source of metabolic acetate for oligodendrocyte myelination and protein/histone acetylation or a precursor for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG). NAA and NAAG as well as aspartoacylase (ASPA), the enzyme responsible for NAA degradation, are significantly reduced in glioma tumors, suggesting a possible role for decreased acetate metabolism in tumorigenesis. This study sought to examine the effects of NAA and NAAG on primary tumor-derived glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) from oligodendroglioma as well as proneural and mesenchymal glioblastoma, relative to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (Oli-Neu). Although the NAA dicarboxylate transporter NaDC3 is primarily thought to be expressed by astrocytes, all cell lines expressed NaDC3 and, thus, are capable of NAA up-take. Treatment with NAA or NAAG significantly increased GSC growth and suppressed differentiation of Oli-Neu cells and proneural GSCs. Interestingly, ASPA was expressed in both the cytosol and nuclei of GSCs and exhibited greatest nuclear immunoreactivity in differentiation-resistant GSCs. Both NAA and NAAG elicited the expression of a novel immunoreactive ASPA species in select GSC nuclei, suggesting differential ASPA regulation in response to these metabolites. Therefore, this study highlights a potential role for nuclear ASPA expression in GSC malignancy and suggests that the use of NAA or NAAG is not an appropriate therapeutic approach to increase acetate bioavailability in glioma. Thus, an alternative acetate source is required.",2014,"Cancer Stem Cells; Differentiation; Metabolism; Oligodendrocytes; Proliferation; Amidohydrolases; Animals; Aspartic Acid; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Transformed; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Dipeptides; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Mice; Neoplasm Proteins; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Neuroprotective Agents; Oligodendroglioma",1

35117330,SLIT3,10.21037/tcr-20-3177,Analyzing the key gene expression and prognostics values for acute myeloid leukemia.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the first tumor types sequenced at the whole genome level. However, numbers of the mutated genes expression levels, functions, and prognostics values still unclear. To most ordinary mutated genes were analyzed via cancer virtual cohort discovery analysis platform (CVCDAP), and further investigated the mutational conversions, variant allele frequencies (VAF), driver genes, and potential druggable mutated genes in AML. The top mutated gene mRNA expression levels and the relationship between gene expression levels and prognosis for AML patients were performed by Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). Moreover, we used the UALCAN dataset to confirm the association between gene expression levels and prognosis for AML patients. Enrichment functions of the top mutated genes of AML were analyzed through Metascape. Finally, the role of these defined genes in cancer pathways and potential drug targets were analyzed by gene set cancer analysis (GSCALite). The top 20 mutated genes for AML included <i>FLT3</i>, <i>HPS3</i>, <i>ABCA6</i>, <i>PCLO</i>, <i>SLIT2</i>, and other ones. Compared to normal control samples, NPM1 and GABRB3 were significantly downregulated in AML samples, but TP53, DNMT3A, HPS3, FLT3, SENP6, and RUNX1 were significantly overexpressed (all these genes P value &lt;0.01). Overexpression of FLT3 and PCLO indicated a poor prognosis, but the overexpression of SLIT3 functioned as a protector for AML via GEPIA. HSP3 indicates the favorable factor for AML, but overexpression of ABCA6 (P=0.066) may act as the adverse factor by UALCAN analysis. Enrichment function analysis shows the functions of defining genes, including negative regulation of cell differentiation, small GTPase mediated signal transduction, and immune system process. Finally, these genes participate in apoptosis, cell cycle, PI3K/AKT, and RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, and FLT3 is sensitive to 5-Fluorouracil, Methotrexate, ATRA. DNMT3A and IDH2 are resistant to Trametinib. RUNX1 and TP53 were sensitive to I-BET-762 and Tubastatin A. Present study showed overexpression of FLT3, ABCA6, and PCLO indicated the poor prognosis of AML, but overexpression of SLIT3 and HSP3 functioned as an AML protector. There are several drugs and small molecules that target the top 20 mutated genes in AML.",2022,Acute myeloid leukemia (AML); bioinformatics analysis; top mutated genes,3

The Chinese papillary thyroid carcinoma tumors harbored somatic mutations in the known driver genes, such as KRAS, TP53, BRAF, ERBB2 , and MET . In addition, we identified novel papillary thyroid carcinoma candidate genes that had not been well studied before. We also identified a gene mutation signature involving SPTA1, MAP2, SYNE1 , and SLIT3 that is significantly associated with survival of papillary thyroid carcinoma patients. Transcriptome analysis using the initial papillary thyroid carcinoma tumor samples and a new Chinese papillary thyroid carcinoma dataset identified six commonly upregulated oncogenic pathways in both datasets including eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine kinase (AKT), Ephrin Receptor, Rho Family GTPase signaling, nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress response, and remodeling of epithelial adherens junctions. Overall, we identified novel candidate genes and oncogenic pathways important to the etiology of papillary thyroid carcinoma in Chinese patients and found the association of a gene signature with the survival outcome of the thyroid cancer patients. These findings may help in moving toward the more comprehensive and effective personalized treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma in Chinese.",2023,"Humans; Thyroid Cancer, Papillary; East Asian People; Thyroid Neoplasms; Mutation; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing",3
26291085,SLIT3,10.1371/journal.pone.0133836,Comprehensive DNA Methylation Analysis Reveals a Common Ten-Gene Methylation Signature in Colorectal Adenomas and Carcinomas.,"Microarray analysis of promoter hypermethylation provides insight into the role and extent of DNA methylation in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) and may be co-monitored with the appearance of driver mutations. Colonic biopsy samples were obtained endoscopically from 10 normal, 23 adenoma (17 low-grade (LGD) and 6 high-grade dysplasia (HGD)), and 8 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (4 active and 4 inactive). CRC samples were obtained from 24 patients (17 primary, 7 metastatic (MCRC)), 7 of them with synchronous LGD. Field effects were analyzed in tissues 1 cm (n = 5) and 10 cm (n = 5) from the margin of CRC. Tissue materials were studied for DNA methylation status using a 96 gene panel and for KRAS and BRAF mutations. Expression levels were assayed using whole genomic mRNA arrays. SFRP1 was further examined by immunohistochemistry. HT29 cells were treated with 5-aza-2' deoxycytidine to analyze the reversal possibility of DNA methylation. More than 85% of tumor samples showed hypermethylation in 10 genes (SFRP1, SST, BNC1, MAL, SLIT2, SFRP2, SLIT3, ALDH1A3, TMEFF2, WIF1), whereas the frequency of examined mutations were below 25%. These genes distinguished precancerous and cancerous lesions from inflamed and healthy tissue. The mRNA alterations that might be caused by systematic methylation could be partly reversed by demethylation treatment. Systematic changes in methylation patterns were observed early in CRC carcinogenesis, occuring in precursor lesions and CRC. Thus we conclude that DNA hypermethylation is an early and systematic event in colorectal carcinogenesis, and it could be potentially reversed by systematic demethylation therapy, but it would need more in vitro and in vivo experiments to support this theory.",2016,"Adenoma; Adolescent; Carcinoma; Cell Line, Tumor; Colitis, Ulcerative; Colorectal Neoplasms; DNA Methylation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HT29 Cells; Humans; Mutation; Promoter Regions, Genetic; RNA, Messenger; Transcriptome",3

To date, targeted sequencing studies have identified IDH2 and SMARCB1 as potential driver alterations, but the molecular alterations found in SMARCB1 wild type tumors are unknown. We evaluated survival outcomes in a cohort of 46 SNUC patients treated at an NCI designated cancer center and identify clinical and disease variables associated with survival on Kaplan-Meier and Cox multivariate survival analysis. We performed exome sequencing to characterize a series of SNUC tumors (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5) and cell line (MDA8788-6) to identify high confidence mutations, copy number alterations, microsatellite instability, and fusions. Knockdown studies using siRNA were utilized for validation of a novel PGAP3-SRPK1 gene fusion. Overall survival analysis revealed no significant difference in outcomes between patients treated with surgery +/- CRT and CRT alone. Tobacco use was the only significant predictor of survival. We also confirmed previously published findings on IDH and SMARC family mutations and identified novel recurrent aberrations in the JAK/STAT and PI3K pathways. We also validated a novel PGAP3-SRPK1 gene fusion in the SNUC cell line, and show that knockdown of the fusion is negatively associated with EGFR, E2F and MYC signaling. Collectively, these data demonstrate recurrent alterations in the SWI/SNF family as well as IDH, JAK/STAT, and PI3K pathways and discover a novel fusion gene (PGAP3-SRPK1). These data aim to improve understanding of possible driver mutations and guide future therapeutic strategies for this disease.",2021,"SMARCA; SNUC; SWI/SNF; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases; Carcinoma; Cell Line, Tumor; Chemoradiotherapy, Adjuvant; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Maxillary Sinus Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Receptors, Cell Surface; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult",2
28394329,MSRB3,10.1038/nm.4323,A stemness-related ZEB1-MSRB3 axis governs cellular pliancy and breast cancer genome stability.,"Chromosomal instability (CIN), a feature of most adult neoplasms from their early stages onward, is a driver of tumorigenesis. However, several malignancy subtypes, including some triple-negative breast cancers, display a paucity of genomic aberrations, thus suggesting that tumor development may occur in the absence of CIN. Here we show that the differentiation status of normal human mammary epithelial cells dictates cell behavior after an oncogenic event and predetermines the genetic routes toward malignancy. Whereas oncogene induction in differentiated cells induces massive DNA damage, mammary stem cells are resistant, owing to a preemptive program driven by the transcription factor ZEB1 and the methionine sulfoxide reductase MSRB3. The prevention of oncogene-induced DNA damage precludes induction of the oncosuppressive p53-dependent DNA-damage response, thereby increasing stem cells' intrinsic susceptibility to malignant transformation. In accord with this model, a subclass of breast neoplasms exhibit unique pathological features, including high ZEB1 expression, a low frequency of TP53 mutations and low CIN.",2017,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinoma; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; DNA Damage; Epithelial Cells; Female; Flow Cytometry; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genomic Instability; Humans; Immunoblotting; Mammary Glands, Human; Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases; Mice, Inbred NOD; Middle Aged; Reactive Oxygen Species; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Stem Cells; Tissue Array Analysis; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Young Adult; Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1",2
23326307,AFAP1L1,10.1371/journal.pone.0049709,"The transcription factor Sp3 regulates the expression of a metastasis-related marker of sarcoma, actin filament-associated protein 1-like 1 (AFAP1L1).","We previously identified actin filament-associated protein 1-like 1 (AFAP1L1) as a metastasis-predicting marker from the gene-expression profiles of 65 spindle cell sarcomas, and demonstrated the up-regulation of AFAP1L1 expression to be an independent risk factor for distant metastasis in multivariate analyses. Little is known, however, about how the expression of AFAP1L1 is regulated. Luciferase reporter assays showed tandem binding motives of a specificity protein (Sp) located at -85 to -75 relative to the transcriptional start site to be essential to the promoter activity. Overexpression of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins transactivated the proximal AFAP1L1 promoter construct, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that both Sp1 and Sp3 were able to bind to this region in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, however, revealed that Sp3 is the major factor binding to the proximal promoter region of the AFAP1L1 gene in AFAP1L1- positive cells. Treatment with mithramycin A, an inhibitor of proteins binding to GC-rich regions, prevented Sp3 from binding to the proximal promoter region of AFAP1L1 and decreased its expression in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, knocking down Sp3 using small inhibitory RNA duplex (siRNA) reduced AFAP1L1 expression significantly, which was partially restored by expressing siRNA-resistant Sp3. These findings indicate a novel role for Sp3 in sarcomas as a driver for expression of the metastasis-related gene AFAP1L1.",2013,"Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Binding Sites; Biomarkers, Tumor; Blotting, Western; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Luciferases; Microfilament Proteins; Neoplasm Metastasis; Plicamycin; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Binding; RNA Interference; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sarcoma; Sp3 Transcription Factor; Transcriptional Activation",1
35895896,MRC1,10.1182/blood.2022016033,Proteomic and phosphoproteomic landscapes of acute myeloid leukemia.,"We have developed a deep-scale proteome and phosphoproteome database from 44 representative acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients from the LAML TCGA dataset and 6 healthy bone marrow-derived controls. After confirming data quality, we orthogonally validated several previously undescribed features of AML revealed by the proteomic data. We identified examples of posttranscriptionally regulated proteins both globally (ie, in all AML samples) and also in patients with recurrent AML driver mutations. For example, samples with IDH1/2 mutations displayed elevated levels of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent histone demethylases KDM4A/B/C, despite no changes in messenger RNA levels for these genes; we confirmed this finding in&#xa0;vitro. In samples with NPMc mutations, we identified several nuclear importins with posttranscriptionally increased protein abundance and showed that they interact with NPMc but not wild-type NPM1. We identified 2 cell surface proteins (CD180 and MRC1/CD206) expressed on AML blasts of many patients (but not healthy CD34+ stem/progenitor cells) that could represent novel targets for immunologic therapies and confirmed these targets via flow cytometry. Finally, we detected nearly 30&#x2009;000 phosphosites in these samples; globally, AML samples were associated with the abnormal phosphorylation of specific residues in PTPN11, STAT3, AKT1, and PRKCD. FLT3-TKD samples were associated with increased phosphorylation of activating tyrosines on the cytoplasmic Src-family tyrosine kinases FGR and HCK and related signaling proteins. PML-RARA-initiated AML samples displayed a unique phosphorylation signature, and TP53-mutant samples showed abundant phosphorylation of serine-183 on TP53 itself. This publicly available database will serve as a foundation for further investigations of protein dysregulation in AML pathogenesis.",2022,"Histone Demethylases; Humans; Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases; Karyopherins; Ketoglutaric Acids; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Membrane Proteins; Mutation; Nuclear Proteins; Nucleophosmin; Proteome; Proteomics; RNA, Messenger; Serine; fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3; src-Family Kinases",4
35288093,MRC1,10.1016/j.trecan.2022.02.006,C1q+ macrophages: passengers or drivers of cancer progression.,"The omics era made possible the quest for efficient markers for cancer progression and revealed that macrophage populations are much more complex than just the M1/M2 dichotomy. Complement C1q pops up as a marker of a tolerogenic and immunosuppressive macrophage populations in both healthy and tumor tissues, but the specific role of C1q+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is poorly understood. C1q is co-expressed in healthy and tumor macrophages with human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR), Apolipoprotein E (APOE), and mannose receptor C-type 1 (MRC1) (CD206), suggesting a resident origin of this population. TAM expressing C1q correlate with T cell exhaustion and poor prognosis in numerous cancers.

33649219,MRC1,10.1073/pnas.2017089118,TAp73 represses NF-&#x3ba;B-mediated recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages in breast cancer.,"Infiltration of tumor-promoting immune cells is a strong driver of tumor progression. Especially the accumulation of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment is known to facilitate tumor growth and to correlate with poor prognosis in many tumor types. TAp73, a member of the p53/p63/p73 family, acts as a tumor suppressor and has been shown to suppress tumor angiogenesis. However, what role TAp73 has in regulating immune cell infiltration is unknown. Here, we report that low levels of TAp73 correlate with an increased NF-&#x3ba;B-regulated inflammatory signature in breast cancer. Furthermore, we show that loss of TAp73 results in NF-&#x3ba;B hyperactivation and secretion of Ccl2, a known NF-&#x3ba;B target and chemoattractant for monocytes and macrophages. Importantly, TAp73-deficient tumors display an increased accumulation of protumoral macrophages that express the mannose receptor (CD206) and scavenger receptor A (CD204) compared to controls. The relevance of TAp73 expression in human breast carcinoma was further accentuated by revealing that TAp73 expression correlates negatively with the accumulation of protumoral CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages in breast cancer patient samples. Taken together, our findings suggest that TAp73 regulates macrophage accumulation and phenotype in breast cancer through inhibition of the NF-&#x3ba;B pathway.",2021,"NF-&#x3ba;B; breast cancer; p73; tumor-associated macrophages; Animals; Antigens, CD; Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic; Breast Neoplasms; Chemokine CCL2; Female; Humans; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; NF-kappa B; Receptors, Cell Surface; Receptors, Immunologic; Scavenger Receptors, Class A; Signal Transduction; Tumor Microenvironment; Tumor Protein p73; Tumor-Associated Macrophages",4

However, the mechanisms for the formation of M2-like TAMs remain enigmatic. Here, we show that lactate is a pivotal oncometabolite in the TME that drives macrophage M2-polarization to promote breast cancer proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. In addition, we identified that the activation of ERK/STAT3, major signaling molecules in the lactate signaling pathway, deepens our molecular understanding of how lactate educates TAMs. Moreover, suppression of ERK/STAT3 signaling diminished tumor growth and angiogenesis by abolishing lactate-induced M2 macrophage polarization. Finally, research data of the natural compound withanolide D provide evidence for ERK/STAT3 signaling as a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. These findings suggest that the lactate-ERK/STAT3 signaling pathway is a driver of breast cancer progression by stimulating macrophage M2-like polarization and reveal potential new therapeutic targets for breast cancer treatment.",2019,"Lactate; M2 macrophage polarization; STAT3-ERK1/2 signaling; angiogenesis; breast cancer; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Female; Humans; Lactic Acid; Macrophages; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Phosphorylation; Receptors, Immunologic; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Signal Transduction; Tumor Microenvironment; Withanolides",4

Although hypotheses propose that succinate accumulation after SDH loss poisons dioxygenases and activates pseudohypoxia and epigenomic hypermethylation, it remains unclear whether these mechanisms account for oncogenic transcriptional patterns. Additionally, MAML3 translocation has recently been identified as a genetic alteration in PPGL, but is poorly understood. We hypothesize that a key to understanding tumorigenesis driven by these genetic alterations is identification of the transcription factors responsible for the observed oncogenic transcriptional changes. We leverage publicly-available human tumor gene expression profiling experiments (N&#xa0;=&#x2009;179) to reconstruct a PPGL tumor-specific transcriptional network. We subsequently use the inferred transcriptional network to perform master regulator analyses nominating transcription factors predicted to control oncogenic transcription in specific PPGL molecular subtypes. Results are validated by analysis of an independent collection of PPGL tumor specimens (N&#xa0;=&#x2009;188). We then perform a similar master regulator analysis in SDH-loss mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to infer aspects of SDH loss master regulator response conserved across species and tissue types. A small number of master regulator transcription factors are predicted to drive the observed subtype-specific gene expression patterns in SDH loss and MAML3 translocation-positive PPGL. Interestingly, although EPAS1 perturbation is detectible in SDH-loss and VHL-loss tumors, it is by no means the most potent factor driving observed patterns of transcriptional dysregulation. Analysis of conserved SDH-loss master regulators in human tumors and MEFs implicated ZNF423, a known modulator of retinoic acid response in neuroblastoma. Subsequent functional analysis revealed a blunted cell death response to retinoic acid in SDH-loss MEFs and blunted differentiation response in SDH-inhibited SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The unbiased analyses presented here nominate specific transcription factors that are likely drivers of oncogenic transcription in PPGL tumors. This information has the potential to be exploited for targeted therapy. Additionally, the observation that SDH loss or inhibition results in blunted retinoic acid response suggests a potential developmental etiology for this tumor subtype.",2019,"Mastermind-like transcriptional coactivator 3; Paraganglioma; Pheochromocytoma; Retinoic acid; Succinate dehydrogenase; Transcription factor; Transcriptional network; von Hippel-Lindau; Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Algorithms; Animals; Cells, Cultured; DNA-Binding Proteins; Databases, Genetic; Fibroblasts; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Mutation; Pheochromocytoma; Succinate Dehydrogenase; Trans-Activators; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Translocation, Genetic; Tretinoin; Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein",1

Seventy-six mutations were observed in 3 or more patients in the cohort, and out of those, STAT3, KMT2D, PIK3R1, TTN, EYS, and SULF1 mutations were shared between both subtypes.

Hotspot mutations in STAT3, PIK3R1, and FAS were detected, whereas truncating mutations in epigenetic modifying enzymes such as KMT2D and TET2 were observed. Moreover, STAT3 mutations co-occurred with mutations in chromatin and epigenetic modifying genes, especially KMT2D and SETD1B (P &lt; .01 and P &lt; .05, respectively). STAT3 was mutated in 50.5% of the patients.

Somatic activating mutations (Q160P, D170Y, L287F) in the STAT3 coiled-coil domain were characterized. STAT3-mutant patients exhibited increased mutational burden and enrichment of a mutational signature associated with increased spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine.

Multilevel-omics in 38 matched pairs of initial and relapsed T-ALL revealed 18 (47%) type-1 (defined by being derived from the major ancestral clone) and 20 (53%) type-2 relapses (derived from a minor ancestral clone). In both types of relapse, we observed known and novel drivers of multidrug resistance including MDR1 and MVP, NT5C2 and JAK-STAT activators. Patients with type-1 relapses were specifically characterized by IL7R upregulation. In remarkable contrast, type-2 relapses demonstrated (1) enrichment of constitutional cancer predisposition gene mutations, (2) divergent genetic and epigenetic remodeling, and (3) enrichment of somatic hypermutator phenotypes, related to BLM, BUB1B/PMS2 and TP53 mutations. T-ALLs that later progressed to type-2 relapses exhibited a complex subclonal architecture, unexpectedly, already at the time of initial diagnosis. Deconvolution analysis of ATAC-Seq profiles showed that T-ALLs later developing into type-1 relapses resembled a predominant immature thymic T-cell population, whereas T-ALLs developing into type-2 relapses resembled a mixture of normal T-cell precursors. In sum, our analyses revealed fundamentally different mechanisms driving either type-1 or type-2 T-ALL relapse and indicate that differential capacities of disease evolution are already inherent to the molecular setup of the initial leukemia.",2022,Child; Clonal Evolution; Humans; Mutation; Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Recurrence,18

Amongst the wide array of driver mutations, 10% of T-ALL patients display gain-of-function mutations in the IL-7 receptor &#x3b1; chain (IL-7R&#x3b1;, encoded by IL7R), which occur in different molecular subtypes of this disease. However, it is still unclear whether IL-7R mutational activation is sufficient to transform T-cell precursors. Also, which genes cooperate with IL7R to drive leukemogenesis remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that mutant IL7R alone is capable of inducing T-ALL with long-latency in stable transgenic zebrafish and transformation is associated with MYC transcriptional activation. Additionally, we find that mutant IL7R collaborates with Myc to induce early onset T-ALL in transgenic zebrafish, supporting a model where these pathways collaborate to drive leukemogenesis. T-ALLs co-expressing mutant IL7R and Myc activate STAT5 and AKT pathways, harbor reduced numbers of apoptotic cells and remake tumors in transplanted zebrafish faster than T-ALLs expressing Myc alone. Moreover, limiting-dilution cell transplantation experiments reveal that activated IL-7R signaling increases the overall frequency of leukemia propagating cells.

The gene set enrichment analysis of the total expression matrix and the ingenuity pathway analysis of the 136 differentially expressed genes showed that the cell cycle was altered in the bone marrow with four overexpressed genes (PLK1, CDC20, CDC45, and GADD45A) and a low expression of IL7R and PIK3CG, which are involved in B cell differentiation. A comparative bioinformatics analysis of 15 bone marrow and 10 peripheral blood samples from Hispanic B-ALL patients collected by the TARGET program, corroborated the genes observed, except for PIK3CG. We conclude the Mexican and the Hispanic B-ALL patients studied present common driver alterations and histotype-specific mutations that could facilitate risk stratification and diagnostic accuracy and serve as potential therapeutic targets.",2022,ARACNE; FACS; PIK3CG; Pediatric precursor B-ALL; SMIM10LB2; TARGET,18

Uncovering the mutations in genes involved in crucial oncogenic pathways is a key step in discovery and development of novel biomarkers. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is a powerful method for the detection of cancer driver mutations. The present work focuses on identifying functionally damaging mutations in patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) through computational analysis of WES. In this study, WES data of HGSC patients was retrieved from the genomic literature available in sequence read archive, the variants were identified and comprehensive structural and functional analysis was performed. Interestingly, I66T and V138I mutations were found to be co-occurring in the IL7R gene in four out of five HGSC patient samples investigated in this study. The V138I mutation was located in the fibronectin type-3 domain and computationally assessed to be causing disruptive effects on the structure and dynamics of IL7R protein. This mutation was found to be co-occurring with the neutral I66T mutation in the same domain which compensated the disruptive effects of V138I variant. These comprehensive studies point to a hitherto unexplored significant role of the IL7R gene in ovarian carcinoma. It is envisaged that the work will lay the foundation for the development of a novel biomarker with potential application in molecular profiling and in estimation of the disease prognosis.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

LUAD with brain metastases (BMs) usually have poor prognosis. To identify the potential genetic factors associated with BM, a genomic comparison for BM cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and primary lung tumor samples obtained from 1082 early- and late-stage LUAD patients was performed. We found that single nucleotide variation (SNV) of EGFR was highly enriched in CSF (87% of samples). Compared with the other primary lung tissues, copy number gain of EGFR (27%), CDK4 (11%), PMS2 (11%), MET (10%), IL7R (8%), RICTOR (7%), FLT4 (5%), and FGFR4 (4%), and copy number loss of CDKN2A (28%) and CDKN2B (18%) were remarkably more frequent in CSF samples. CSF had significantly lower tumor mutation burden (TMB) level but more abundant copy number variant. It was also found that the relationships among co-occurrent and mutually exclusive genes were dynamically changing with LUAD development. Additionally, CSF (97% of samples) harbored more abundant targeted drugs related driver and fusion genes. The signature 15 associated with defective DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) was only identified in the CSF group. Cancer associated pathway analysis further revealed that ErbB (95%) and cell cycle (84%) were unique pathways in CSF samples. The tumor evolution analysis showed that CSF carried significantly fewer clusters, but subclonal proportion of EGFR was remarkably increased with tumor progression. Collectively, CSF sequencing showed unique genomic characteristics and the intense copy number instability associated with cell cycle disorder and dMMR might be the crucial genetic factors in BM of LUAD.",2022,"Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Brain Neoplasms; Clone Cells; DNA Copy Number Variations; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genomics; Genotype; Humans; Liver; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Signal Transduction; Tumor Burden; Young Adult",18

Inflammation is considered as a critical driver for CRC development and growth. We investigated the association between polymorphisms/expression levels of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) /TSLP receptors and CRC risk in Saudi population. DNA samples were isolated from blood samples from 220 participants. Case subjects were 112 patients diagnosed with CRC, while control subjects were 108 healthy individuals, who were not diagnosed with any type of malignancy. We selected two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the thymic stromal lymphopoietin gene (<i>rs10043985</i> and <i>rs2289276</i>), three SNPs in TSLP receptor gene (<i>TSLPR</i>; <i>rs36139698</i>, <i>rs36177645</i>, and <i>rs36133495</i>), and two other SNPs in interleukin-7 receptor gene (<i>IL-7R</i>; <i>rs12516866</i> and <i>rs1053496</i>), and designated these SNPs for a case-control genotyping study. The gene expression was analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry assays array on 20 matching colorectal cancer/normal tissues. mRNA expressions and protein levels of TSLP, TSLPR-&#x3b1; subunit, and IL-7R-&#x3b1; subunit showed a 4-fold increase in colon cancer tissues when compared to normal colon tissues. Furthermore, two SNPs (rs10043985 of TSLP and rs1053496 of IL-7R) showed statistically significant correlations with CRC susceptibility. Interestingly, only rs10043985 showed a statistically significant association (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) in the genotypic and phenotypic levels with CRC for all clinical parameters (age, gender, and tumor location) tested. However, IL-7R rs1053496 genotyping results presented a significant correlation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in male CRC patients and in individuals under 57 years of age. TSLP rs2289276, IL-7R rs12516866, and all TSLPR variants did not display any significant genotypic or phenotypic correlations in all tested clinical parameters. This study identified that TSLP rs10043985 and IL-7R rs1053496 SNPs, and the expression levels of TSLP and TSLPR-&#x3b1; subunit, can be used as markers for CRC development and treatment.

This impairs the development of therapeutic regimens that can address the aggressive phenotype and lineage plasticity of MLL-AF4-driven leukemogenesis. This study highlights novel mechanisms of disease development by focusing on 2 microRNAs (miRNAs) upregulated in leukemic blasts from primary patient samples: miR-130b and miR-128a. We show that miR-130b and miR-128a are downstream targets of MLL-AF4 and can individually drive the transition from a pre-leukemic stage to an acute leukemia in an entirely murine Mll-AF4 in vivo model. They are also required to maintain the disease phenotype. Interestingly, miR-130b overexpression led to a mixed/B-cell precursor (BCP)/myeloid leukemia, propagated by the lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor (LMPP) population, whereas miR-128a overexpression resulted in a pro-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), maintained by a highly expanded Il7r+c-Kit+ blast population. Molecular and phenotypic changes induced by these two miRNAs fully recapitulate the human disease, including central nervous system infiltration and activation of an MLL-AF4 expression signature. Furthermore, we identified 2 downstream targets of these miRNAs, NR2F6 and SGMS1, which in extensive validation studies are confirmed as novel tumor suppressors of MLL-AF4+ leukemia. Our integrative approach thus provides a platform for the identification of essential co-drivers of MLL-rearranged leukemias, in which the preleukemia to leukemia transition and lineage plasticity can be dissected and new therapeutic approaches can be tested.",2021,"Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic; Humans; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Male; Mice; MicroRNAs; Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Preleukemia; Transcriptional Elongation Factors; Translocation, Genetic",18
33970999,IL7R,10.1182/blood.2019000553,Overexpression of wild-type IL-7R&#x3b1; promotes T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.,"Tight regulation of IL-7R&#x3b1; expression is essential for normal T-cell development. IL-7R&#x3b1; gain-of-function mutations are known drivers of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Although a subset of patients with T-ALL display high IL7R messenger RNA levels and cases with IL7R gains have been reported, the impact of IL-7R&#x3b1; overexpression, rather than mutational activation, during leukemogenesis remains unclear. In this study, overexpressed IL-7R&#x3b1; in tetracycline-inducible Il7r transgenic and Rosa26 IL7R knockin mice drove potential thymocyte self-renewal, and thymus hyperplasia related to increased proliferation of T-cell precursors, which subsequently infiltrated lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow, ultimately leading to fatal leukemia. The tumors mimicked key features of human T-ALL, including heterogeneity in immunophenotype and genetic subtype between cases, frequent hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway paralleled by downregulation of p27Kip1 and upregulation of Bcl-2, and gene expression signatures evidencing activation of JAK/STAT, PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Notch signaling. Notably, we also found that established tumors may no longer require high levels of IL-7R expression upon secondary transplantation and progressed in the absence of IL-7, but remain sensitive to inhibitors of IL-7R-mediated signaling ruxolitinib (Jak1), AZD1208 (Pim), dactolisib (PI3K/mTOR), palbociclib (Cdk4/6), and venetoclax (Bcl-2). The relevance of these findings for human disease are highlighted by the fact that samples from patients with T-ALL with high wild-type IL7R expression display a transcriptional signature resembling that of IL-7-stimulated pro-T cells and, critically, of IL7R-mutant cases of T-ALL. Overall, our study demonstrates that high expression of IL-7R&#x3b1; can promote T-cell tumorigenesis, even in the absence of IL-7R&#x3b1; mutational activation.",2021,"Animals; Carcinogenesis; Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic; Humans; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Mutation; Neoplasm Proteins; Neoplasms, Experimental; Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Receptors, Interleukin-7; Signal Transduction; Thymocytes",18

However, there are certain cases of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) wherein no inherent driver mutation is detected resulting in clinical phenotype. It is important to identify key genes and pathways in driving the disease. The aim of the study was to use a gene-based omics approach to molecularly characterize these mutation-positive and negative cases to further strengthen diagnostics and precision medicine. A microarray profiling was done on CD34 positive cells isolated from two BCR-ABL positive and five BCR-ABL negative samples. JAK2V617F mutation testing was also done to rule out the presence of any other mutation in the latter group. The fold change cut-off was taken as &#xb1;1.5 with p&#x2264;0.5 for significant genes. The gene network and pathway analysis were done using DAVID and STRING software. The genes upregulated in BCR-ABL negative samples were shown to be involved in immune regulation, signal transduction and T- and B-cell signalling. The protein-protein interaction network of upregulated genes in these samples were enriched for various immunomodulatory genes such as HLADP, HLADQ, IL7R, CCR7, CD3 subtypes. These genes further formed a network with signal transduction genes such as LCK, FYN, RAG1, DOCK1, AKT3, SMAD3, LEF1. The results suggested a modulation of immune response genes and its subsequent effect on oncogenic signalling in BCR-ABL negative samples as compared to BCR-ABL positive samples. The protein network analysis was enriched for genes involved in Src, TGF-beta and PI3K-AKT pathway contributing to the proliferation of neoplastic clone.",2022,BCR-ABL; CD34; JAK2 V617F; immune; microarray; myeloproliferative neoplasms,18

Genetic alterations in the DNA repair genes, protooncogenes, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifiers have been studied in the past decade using next-generation sequencing and high-resolution copy number arrays. While other genomic lesions like chromosomal rearrangements, inversions, insertions, and gene fusions have been well studied at functional level, the mechanism of generation of driver mutations in T-ALL is the subject of current investigation. Novel oncogenic mutations in the TP53, BRCA2, PTEN, IL7R, RAS, NOTCH1, ETV6, BCL11B, WT1, DNMT3A, PRC2, PHF6, USP7, KDM6A and an array of other genes disrupt the genetic and epigenetic homeostasis in T-ALL. In this review, we have summarized the mechanistic role of deleterious driver mutations in T-ALL initiation and progression. We speculate that the formation of non-B DNA structures could be one of the primary reasons for the occurrence of different genomic lesions seen in T-ALL, which warrants further investigation.

Gain-of-function mutations in the alpha chain of the IL-7 receptor found in ALL patients clearly demonstrated that this pathway was a driver. However mutant IL-7R alone was insufficient to transform primary T cell progenitors, indicating that cooperating mutations were required. Here we review evidence for additional oncogenic mutations in the IL-7 pathway. We discuss several oncogenes, loss of tumor suppressor genes and epigenetic effects that can cooperate with mutant IL-7 receptor. These include NRas, HOXA, TLX3, Notch 1, Arf, PHF6, WT1, PRC, PTPN2 and CK2.

However, the underlying genetic defects of the non-mutant cases are still unknown. Using a 409 gene panel, we employed targeted next generation sequencing to investigate the mutational landscape in a cohort of seven PI3K/AKT-negative cases and five cases with known hotspot mutations in either PIK3CA or AKT1. In total, we identified 29 mutations in 22 of 409 genes. The four cases with PIK3CA hotspot mutations carried no or only few additional mutations. The AKT1 hotspot mutated case harboured additional mutations in four genes (SYNE1, ADAMTS20, EP400 and CASC5). At least two of these genes are involved in or contribute to the PI3K/AKT-pathway. In the seven non-hotspot mutated cases we observed 18 mutations. Each case carried at least one mutation in a gene contributing to or involved in PI3K/AKT-signalling.

Our findings show that the mechanism of action of BETi/HDACi therapy in CTCL involves induction of both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis with reduced proliferative drivers and enhanced expression of apoptotic extrinsic pathway death receptors and ligands.

Tobacco chewing is implicated with most of the cases of HNSCC but this type of cancer is increasing in non-tobacco chewers as well. This study was instigated to provide comprehensive variant and gene-level data in HNSCC subjects of the Indian population and fill the gap in the literature on comparative assessment of gene mutations in cancer subjects with a habit of tobacco and those without any habit using targeted amplicon sequencing. We performed targeted Amplicon sequencing of 409 tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, frequently mutated across many cancer types, including head and neck. DNA from primary tumor tissues and matched blood was analyzed for HNSCC patients with a habit of tobacco and those without any habit. PDE4DIP, SYNE1, and NOTCH1 emerged as the highly mutated genes in HNSCC. A total of 39 candidate causal variants in 22 unique cancer driver genes were identified in non-habitual (WoH) and habitual (WH) subjects. Comparison of genes from both the subjects, showed seven unique cancer driver genes (KIT, ATM, RNF213, GATA2, DST, RET, CYP2C19) in WoH, while WH showed five (IL7R, PKHD1, MLL3, PTPRD, MAPK8) and 10 genes (SETD2, ATR, CDKN2A, NCOA4, TP53, SYNE1, KAT6B, THBS1, PTPRT, and FGFR3) were common to both subjects. In addition to this NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and NOTCH4 gene were found to be mutated only in habitual subjects. These findings strongly support a causal role for tobacco, acting via PI3K and MAPK pathway inhibition and stimulation of various genes leading to oncogenic transformations in case of tobacco chewers. In case of non-tobacco chewers it appears that mutations in the pathway affecting the squamous epithelial lineage and DNA repair genes lead to HNSCC. Somatic mutation in CYP2C19 gene in the non-habitual subjects suggests that this gene may have a tobacco independent role in development and progression of HNSCC. In addition to sharing high mutation rate, NOTCH gene family was found to be mutated only in habitual sample. Further, presence of mutated genes not earlier reported to be involved in HNSCC, suggest that the Indian sub-continent may have different sets of genes, as compared to other parts of the world, involved in the development and progression of HNSCC.",2020,Amplicon sequencing; Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; Mutation; Oncogenic transformations; Tobacco,18

Because the treatment response of adult T-ALL is significantly poorer than that of childhood T-ALL and because exon 6 IL7R mutations play a role in the pathogenesis of childhood T-ALL, we sought to determine how the pattern of IL7R mutations varies between adult and childhood T-ALL. To that end, we sequenced the 50-base pair interval in exon 6 of the IL7R of DNA obtained from bone marrow samples of 35 randomly selected adult patients with T-ALL.

We used models of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced B-cell transformation to document the relevance of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) to regulation of epigenetic-repressive marks during lymphomagenesis. EBV(+) lymphomas and transformed cell lines exhibited abundant expression of PRMT5, a type II PRMT enzyme that promotes transcriptional silencing of target genes by methylating arginine residues on histone tails. PRMT5 expression was limited to EBV-transformed cells, not resting or activated B lymphocytes, validating it as an ideal therapeutic target. We developed a first-in-class, small-molecule PRMT5 inhibitor that blocked EBV-driven B-lymphocyte transformation and survival while leaving normal B cells unaffected. Inhibition of PRMT5 led to lost recruitment of a PRMT5/p65/HDAC3-repressive complex on the miR96 promoter, restored miR96 expression, and PRMT5 downregulation. RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments identified several tumor suppressor genes, including the protein tyrosine phosphatase gene PTPROt, which became silenced during EBV-driven B-cell transformation. Enhanced PTPROt expression following PRMT5 inhibition led to dephosphorylation of kinases that regulate B-cell receptor signaling. We conclude that PRMT5 is critical to EBV-driven B-cell transformation and maintenance of the malignant phenotype, and that PRMT5 inhibition shows promise as a novel therapeutic approach for B-cell lymphomas.",2015,"Animals; B-Lymphocytes; Blotting, Western; Cell Line, Transformed; Cell Transformation, Viral; Cells, Cultured; Enzyme Inhibitors; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Histone Deacetylases; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Lymphoma; Mice, SCID; MicroRNAs; Microscopy, Confocal; Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases; RNA Interference; Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Small Molecule Libraries; Transcription Factor RelA; Transcriptome; Tumor Suppressor Proteins",1

Here we explored the role of PARP3 in the oncogenicity of glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain cancer. The absence of PARP3 did not alter cell proliferation nor the in vivo tumorigenic potential of glioblastoma cells. We identified a physical and functional interaction of PARP3 with the histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase G9a. We show that PARP3 helps to adjust G9a-dependent repression of the adhesion genes Nfasc and Parvb and the hypoxia-responsive genes Hif-2&#x3b1;, Runx3, Mlh1, Ndrg1, Ndrg2 and Ndrg4. Specifically for Nfasc, Parvb and Ndrg4, PARP3/G9a cooperate for an adjusted establishment of the repressive mark H3K9me2. While examining the functional consequence in cell response to hypoxia, we discovered that PARP3 acts to maintain the cytoskeletal microtubule stability. As a result, the absence of PARP3 markedly increases the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to microtubule-destabilizing agents providing a new therapeutic avenue for PARP3 inhibition in brain cancer therapy.",2022,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Cycle Proteins; Complement C9; Glioblastoma; Histones; Humans; Hypoxia; Lysine; Methyltransferases; Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases; Tumor Suppressor Proteins,1

We evaluated gastric intratumoral heterogeneity using multiregional sequencing of &gt;700 cancer genes in 115 tumor biopsies from 32 patients, 29 who were Latinos. Analyses focused on comparisons with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and on mutation clonality, druggability, and signatures. We found that only approximately 30% of all mutations were clonal and that only 61% of the known TCGA gastric cancer drivers harbored clonal mutations. Multiple clonal mutations were found in new candidate gastric cancer drivers such as <i>EYS, FAT4, PCDHA1</i>, <i>RAD50, EXO1, RECQL4,</i> and <i>FSIP2.</i> The genomically stable (GS) molecular subtype, which has the worse prognosis, was identified in 48% of our Latino patients, a fraction that was &gt;2.3-fold higher than in TCGA Asian and White patients. Only a third of all tumors harbored clonal pathogenic mutations in druggable genes, with most (93%) GS tumors lacking actionable clonal mutations. Mutation signature analyses revealed that, in microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors, DNA repair mutations were common for both tumor initiation and progression, while tobacco, <i>POLE</i>, and inflammation signatures likely initiate carcinogenesis. MSS tumor progression was likely driven by aging- and aflatoxin-associated mutations, as these latter changes were usually nonclonal. In microsatellite-unstable tumors, nonclonal tobacco-associated mutations were common. Our study, therefore, contributed to advancing gastric cancer molecular diagnostics and suggests clonal status is important to understanding gastric tumorigenesis. Our findings of a higher frequency of a poor prognosis associated molecular subtype in Latinos and a possible new aflatoxin gastric cancer etiology also advance cancer disparities research. Our study contributes to advancing our knowledge of gastric carcinogenesis, diagnostics, and cancer health disparities.",2023,NA,14

Meanwhile, South Korea has the second-highest incidence rate for CRC in the world. To assess the possible influence of ethnicity on the molecular profile of colorectal cancer, we compared genomic and transcriptomic features of South Korean CRCs with European CRCs. We assembled a genomic and transcriptomic dataset of South Korean CRC patients (KOCRC; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;126) from previous studies and European cases (EUCRC; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;245) selected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Then, we compared the two datasets in terms of clinical data, driver genes, mutational signature, gene sets, consensus molecular subtype, and fusion genes. These two cohorts showed similar profiles in driver mutations but differences in the mutation frequencies of some driver genes (including APC, TP53, PABPC1, FAT4, MUC7, HSPG2, GNAS, DENND5B, and BRAF). Analysis of hallmark pathways using genomic data sets revealed further differences between these populations in the WNT, TP53, and NOTCH signaling pathways. In consensus molecular subtype (CMS) analyses of the study cases, no BRAF mutations were found in the CMS1 subtype of KOCRC, which contrasts with previous findings. Fusion gene analysis identified oncogenic fusion of PTPRK-RSPO3 in a subset of KOCRC patients without APC mutations.

34873486,FAT4,,Branching clonal evolution patterns predominate mutational landscape in multiple myeloma.,"Multiple Myeloma (MM) arises from malignant transformation and deregulated proliferation of clonal plasma cells (PCs) harbouring heterogeneous molecular anomalies. The effect of evolving mutations on clone fitness and their cellular prevalence shapes the progressing myeloma genome and impacts clinical outcomes. Although clonal heterogeneity in MM is well established, which subclonal mutations emerge/persist/perish with progression in MM and which of these can be targeted therapeutically remains an open question. In line with this, we have sequenced pairwise whole exomes of 62 MM patients collected at two time points, i.e., at diagnosis and on progression. Somatic variants were called using a novel ensemble approach where a consensus was deduced from four variant callers (Illumina's Dragen, Strelka2, SomaticSniper and SpeedSeq) and actionable/druggable gene targets were identified. A marked intraclonal heterogeneity was observed. Branching evolution was observed among 72.58% patients, of whom 64.51% had low TMBs (&lt;10) and 61.29% had 2 or more founder clones. The hypermutator patients (with high TMB levels &#x2265;10 to &#x2264;100) showed a significant decrease in their TMBs from diagnosis (median TMB 77.11) to progression (median TMB 31.22). A distinct temporal fall in subclonal driver mutations was identified recurrently across diagnosis to progression e.g., in <i>PABPC1, BRAF, KRAS, CR1, DIS3</i> and <i>ATM</i> genes in 3 or more patients suggesting such patients could be treated early with target specific drugs like Vemurafenib/Cobimetinib. An analogous rise in driver mutations was observed in <i>KMT2C, FOXD4L1, SP140, NRAS</i> and other genes. A few drivers such as <i>FAT4, IGLL5</i> and <i>CDKN1A</i> retained consistent distribution patterns at two time points.

The 5-year relative survival rate for patients with CRC is 65% and is correlated with the stage at diagnosis (being 91% for stage I at diagnosis versus 12% for stage IV). This study aimed to identify CRC driver genes to assist in the design of a cancer panel to detect gene mutations during clinical early-stage screening and identify genes for use in prognostic assessments and the evaluation of appropriate treatment options. First, we utilized bioinformatics approaches to analyze 354 paired sequencing profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify CRC driver genes and analyzed the sequencing profiles of 38 patients with &gt;5&#xa0;years of follow-up data to search for prognostic genes. The results revealed eight driver genes and ten prognostic genes. Next, the presence of the identified gene mutations was verified using tissue and blood samples from Taiwanese CRC patients. The results showed that the set identified gene mutations provide high coverage for driver gene screening, and <i>APC, TP53, PIK3CA</i>, and <i>FAT4</i> could be detected in blood as ctDNA test targets.

Recent studies have defined the landscape of genomic alterations of gastric cancer and their association with clinical outcomes. However, the pathogenesis of gastric cancer has not been completely characterised. Driver genes were detected by five computational tools, MutSigCV, OncodriveCLUST, OncodriveFM, dendrix and edriver, using mutation data of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) from the cancer genome altas database, followed by an integrative investigation. <i>TTN, TP53, LRP1B, CSMD3, OBSCN, ARID1A, FAT4, FLG, PCLO</i> and <i>CSMD1</i> were the 10 most frequently mutated genes. <i>PIK3CD, NLRC3, FMNL1, TRAF3IP3</i> and <i>CR1</i> were the top five hub genes of the blue coexpression module positively correlated with pathological tumour stage and lymph node stage (p values &lt;0.05 for all cases).

T-cell immunotherapy can be a ""universal"" treatment for HLA genotype patients sharing same oncogenic mutations. To identify potential neoantigens for therapy in gastric cancer, 32 gastric cancer patients were enrolled in our study. Whole exome sequencing data from these patients was processed by TSNAD software to detect cancer somatic mutations and predict neoantigens. The somatic mutations between different patients suggested a high interpatient heterogeneity. C&gt;A and C&gt;T substitutions are common, suggesting an active nucleotide excision repair. The number of predicted neoantigens was significantly higher in patients at stage T1a compared to in patients at T2 or T4b. Six genes (<i>PIK3CA</i>, <i>FAT4</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>, <i>GNAQ</i>, <i>LRP1B</i>, and <i>PREX2</i>) were found as recurrently mutated driver genes in our study.

Whole-exome sequencing demonstrated distinct mutational signatures in individual sarcoma cohorts. MCA-induced sarcomas exhibited high mutational burden and predominantly G-to-T transversions, while radiation-induced sarcomas exhibited low mutational burden and a distinct genetic signature characterized by C-to-T transitions. The indel to substitution ratio and amount of gene copy number variations were high for radiation-induced sarcomas. MCA-induced tumors generated on a p53-deficient background showed the highest genomic instability. MCA-induced sarcomas harbored mutations in putative cancer-driver genes that regulate MAPK signaling (Kras and Nf1) and the Hippo pathway (Fat1 and Fat4). In contrast, radiation-induced sarcomas and KrasG12Dp53-/- sarcomas did not harbor recurrent oncogenic mutations, rather they exhibited amplifications of specific oncogenes: Kras and Myc in KrasG12Dp53-/- sarcomas, and Met and Yap1 for radiation-induced sarcomas.

Mutation or deletion of the CDH1 gene has been reported in 30-60% cases of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). However, little is known about genomic differences between ILC with and without a CDH1 alteration. Therefore, we analyzed whole genome sequencing data of 169 ILC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to address this deficiency. Our study shows that CDH1 gene was altered in 59.2% (100/169) of ILC. No significant difference was identified between CDH1-altered and -unaltered ILC cases for any of the examined demographic, clinical or pathologic characteristics, including histologic grade, tumor stage, lymph node metastases, or ER/PR/HER2 states. Seven recurrent mutations (PTEN, MUC16, ERBB2, FAT4, PCDHGA2, HERC1 and FLNC) and four chromosomal changes with recurrent copy number variation (CNV) (11q13, 17q12-21, 8p11 and 8q11) were found in ILC, which correlated with a positive or negative CDH1 alteration status, respectively. The prevalence of the most common breast cancer driver abnormalities including TP53 and PIK3CA mutations and MYC and ERBB2 amplifications showed no difference between the two groups.

Nevertheless, the individual driver genes involved in such field cancerization are still unclear. Here, we aimed to demonstrate that FAT4, a novel tumor suppressor identified by exome sequencing of GC, is methylation-silenced and that such methylation is involved in epigenetic field cancerization for GC. A transcription start site was determined by the 5' rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends method. DNA methylation was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing with use of a next-generation sequencer or quantitative methylation-specific PCR. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. A single transcription start site was identified for FAT4 in gastric epithelial cells, and a CpG island was located in the FAT4 promoter region. FAT4 was highly methylated in two of 13 GC cell lines and was not expressed in them. Removal of FAT4 methylation by a DNA demethylating agent (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) restored its expression in the two cell lines. In primary GC samples, FAT4 was methylated in 12 of 82 GCs (14.6&#xa0;%). FAT4 methylation was associated with the presence of the CpG island methylator phenotype but not with prognosis, tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, or histological types. In noncancerous gastric mucosae, high FAT4 methylation levels were associated with the presence of GC and Helicobacter pylori infection. FAT4 was methylation-silenced in GCs.

To identify the mutational spectrum associated with relapse, whole-exome sequencing was performed on 13 matched diagnosis, relapse, and remission trios followed by targeted sequencing of 299 genes in 67 FLT3-ITD patients. The FLT3-ITD genome has an average of 13 mutations per sample, similar to other AML subtypes, which is a low mutation rate compared with that in solid tumors. Recurrent mutations occur in genes related to DNA methylation, chromatin, histone methylation, myeloid transcription factors, signaling, adhesion, cohesin complex, and the spliceosome. Their pattern of mutual exclusivity and cooperation among mutated genes suggests that these genes have a strong biological relationship. In addition, we identified mutations in previously unappreciated genes such as MLL3, NSD1, FAT1, FAT4, and IDH3B. Mutations in 9 genes were observed in the relapse-specific phase. DNMT3A mutations are the most stable mutations, and this DNMT3A-transformed clone can be present even in morphologic complete remissions. Of note, all AML matched trio samples shared at least 1 genomic alteration at diagnosis and relapse, suggesting common ancestral clones. Two types of clonal evolution occur at relapse: either the founder clone recurs or a subclone of the founder clone escapes from induction chemotherapy and expands at relapse by acquiring new mutations. Relapse-specific mutations displayed an increase in transversions. Functional assays demonstrated that both MLL3 and FAT1 exert tumor-suppressor activity in the FLT3-ITD subtype. An inhibitor of XPO1 synergized with standard AML induction chemotherapy to inhibit FLT3-ITD growth.

The effects of those alterations on the fitness of somatic cells lead to evolutionary adaptations such as increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and altered anticancer drug responses. However, there are few general mathematical models to quantitatively examine how perturbations of a single gene shape subsequent evolution of the cancer genome. In this study, we proposed the gene gravity model to study the evolution of cancer genomes by incorporating the genome-wide transcription and somatic mutation profiles of ~3,000 tumors across 9 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas into a broad gene network. We found that somatic mutations of a cancer driver gene may drive cancer genome evolution by inducing mutations in other genes. This functional consequence is often generated by the combined effect of genetic and epigenetic (e.g., chromatin regulation) alterations. By quantifying cancer genome evolution using the gene gravity model, we identified six putative cancer genes (AHNAK, COL11A1, DDX3X, FAT4, STAG2, and SYNE1). The tumor genomes harboring the nonsynonymous somatic mutations in these genes had a higher mutation density at the genome level compared to the wild-type groups. Furthermore, we provided statistical evidence that hypermutation of cancer driver genes on inactive X chromosomes is a general feature in female cancer genomes. In summary, this study sheds light on the functional consequences and evolutionary characteristics of somatic mutations during tumorigenesis by propelling adaptive cancer genome evolution, which would provide new perspectives for cancer research and therapeutics.",2016,"Databases, Genetic; Female; Genome, Human; Genomics; Humans; Male; Models, Genetic; Mutation; Neoplasms",14

The disease is often diagnosed in advanced stages and is associated with a poor prognosis for patients. An in-depth understanding of the molecular underpinnings of gastric cancer has lagged behind many other cancers of similar incidence and morbidity, owing to our limited knowledge of germline susceptibility traits for risk and somatic drivers of progression (to identify novel therapeutic targets). A few germline (PLCE1) and somatic (ERBB2, ERBB3, PTEN, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, FGF, TP53, CDH1 and MET) alterations are emerging and some are being pursued clinically. Novel somatic gene targets (ARID1A, FAT4, MLL and KMT2C) have also been identified and are of interest. Variations in the therapeutic approaches dependent on geographical region are evident for localized gastric cancer-differences that are driven by preferences for the adjuvant strategies and the extent of surgery coupled with philosophical divides. However, greater uniformity in approach has been noted in the metastatic cancer setting, an incurable condition. Having realized only modest successes, momentum is building for carrying out more phase III comparative trials, with some using biomarker-based patient selection strategies. Overall, rapid progress in biotechnology is improving our molecular understanding and can help with new drug discovery. The future prospects are excellent for defining biomarker-based subsets of patients and application of specific therapeutics. However, many challenges remain to be tackled.

This prospective, randomized cohort study included 30 patients and was conducted at an academic infertility centre in Vietnam from April to December 2019. Patients with PCOS were included. In the first stage, sibling oocytes from each patient (671 in total) were allocated in equal numbers to maturation in medium with (CAPA-AREG) or without (CAPA-Control) amphiregulin 100 ng/ml. After a maturation check and fertilization using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), all good quality Day 3 embryos were vitrified. Cumulus cells (CCs) from both groups were collected at the moment of ICSI denudation and underwent a molecular analysis to quantify key transcripts of oocyte maturation and to relate these to early embryo development. On return for frozen embryo transfer (second stage), patients were randomized to have either CAPA-AREG or CAPA-Control embryo(s) implanted. Where no embryo(s) from the randomized group were available, embryo(s) from the other group were transferred. The primary endpoint of the study was meiotic maturation efficiency (proportion of metaphase II [MII] oocytes; maturation rate). In the per-patient analysis, the number of MII oocytes was significantly higher in the CAPA-AREG group versus the CAPA-Control group (median [interquartile range] 7.0 [5.3, 8.0] versus 6.0 [4.0, 7.0]; P = 0.01). When each oocyte was evaluated, the maturation rate was also significantly higher in the CAPA-AREG group versus the CAPA-Control group (67.6% versus 55.2%; relative risk [RR] 1.22 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.38]; P = 0.001). No other IVM or embryology outcomes differed significantly between the two groups. Rates of clinical pregnancy (66.7% versus 42.9%; RR 1.56 [95% CI 0.77-3.14]), ongoing pregnancy (53.3% versus 28.6%; RR 1.87 [95% CI 0.72-4.85]) and live birth (46.7% versus 28.6%; RR 1.63 [95% CI 0.61-4.39]) were numerically higher in the patients who had CAPA-AREG versus CAPA-Control embryos implanted, but each fertility and obstetric outcome did not differ significantly between the groups. In the CAPA-AREG group, there were significant shifts in CC expression of genes involved in steroidogenesis (STAR, 3BHSD), the ovulatory cascade (DUSP16, EGFR, HAS2, PTGR2, PTGS2, RPS6KA2), redox and glucose metabolism (CAT, GPX1, SOD2, SLC2A1, LDHA) and transcription (NRF2). The expression of three genes (TRPM7, VCAN and JUN) in CCs showed a significant correlation with embryo quality. This study included only Vietnamese women with PCOS, limiting the generalizability. Although 100 ng/ml amphiregulin addition to the maturation culture step significantly improved the MII rate, the sample size in this study was small, meaning that these findings should be considered as exploratory. Therefore, a larger patient cohort is needed to confirm whether the positive effects of amphiregulin translate into improved fertility outcomes in patients undergoing IVM. Data from this study confirm the beneficial effects of amphiregulin during IVM with respect to the trigger of oocyte maturation. The gene expression findings in cumulus indicate that multiple pathways might contribute to these beneficial effects and confirm the key role of the epidermal growth factor system in the stepwise acquisition of human oocyte competence.

Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify key genes and pathways involved in transformation of UL to ULMS through molecular differential analysis. Global gene expression profiles of 25 ULMS, 25 UL, and 29 myometrium (Myo) tissues generated on Affymetrix U133A 2.0 human genome microarrays were analyzed by deploying robust statistical, molecular interaction network, and pathway enrichment methods. The comparison of expression signals across Myo vs UL, Myo vs ULMS, and UL vs ULMS groups identified 249, 1037, and 716 significantly expressed genes, respectively (p&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.05). The analysis of 249 DEGs from Myo vs UL confirms multistage dysregulation of various key pathways in extracellular matrix, collagen, cell contact inhibition, and cytokine receptors transform normal myometrial cells to benign leiomyomas (p value &#x2264; 0.01). The 716 DEGs between UL vs ULMS were found to affect cell cycle, cell division related Rho GTPases and PI3K signaling pathways triggering uncontrolled growth and metastasis of tumor cells (p value &#x2264; 0.01). Integration of gene networking data, with additional parameters like estimation of mutation burden of tumors and cancer driver gene identification, has led to the finding of 4 hubs (JUN, VCAN, TOP2A, and COL1A1) and 8 bottleneck genes (PIK3R1, MYH11, KDR, ESR1, WT1, CCND1, EZH2, and CDKN2A), which showed a clear distinction in their distribution pattern among leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas. This study provides vital clues for molecular distinction of UL and ULMS which could further assist in identification of specific diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.<b>Abbreviations</b> UL: Uterine Leiomyomas; ULMS: Uterine Leiomyosarcoma; Myo: Myometrium; DEGs: Differential Expressed Genes; RMA: Robust Multiarray Average; DC: Degree of Centrality; BC: Betweenness of Centrality; CGC: Cancer Gene Census; FDR: False Discovery Rate; TCGA: Cancer Genome Atlas; BP: Biological Process; CC: Cellular Components; MF: Molecular Function; PPI: Protein-Protein Interaction.",2022,Uterine leiomyosarcoma; differentially expressed genes; microarray data analysis; protein interaction network; Female; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Leiomyoma; Leiomyosarcoma; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Uterine Neoplasms,5
33381592,VCAN,10.1155/2020/8859826,Identification of Core Prognosis-Related Candidate Genes in Chinese Gastric Cancer Population Based on Integrated Bioinformatics.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. There are great geographical differences in the incidence of GC, and somatic mutation rates of driver genes are also different. The present study is aimed at screening core prognosis-related candidate genes in Chinese gastric cancer population based on integrated bioinformatics for the early diagnosis and prognosis of GC. In the present study, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GC were identified using four microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The samples of these datasets were all from China. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was conducted to evaluate the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in GC. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and cytoHubba were performed to determine hub genes associated with GC. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) were performed to validate the hub genes. A total of 240 DEGs were obtained through the RRA method, including 80 upregulated genes and 160 downregulated genes. Upregulated genes were mainly enriched in extracellular matrix organization, extracellular matrix, and extracellular matrix structural constituent. The downregulated genes were mainly enriched in digestion, extracellular space, and oxidoreductase activity. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the upregulated genes were mainly associated with ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. And downregulated genes were mainly associated with the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, metabolic pathways, and gastric acid secretion. The transcriptional and translational expression levels of the genes including <i>COL1A1</i>, <i>COL5A2</i>, <i>COL12A1</i>, and <i>VCAN</i> were higher in GC tissues than normal tissues. A total of four genes including <i>COL1A1</i>, <i>COL5A2</i>, <i>COL12A1</i>, and <i>VCAN</i> were considered potential GC biomarkers in the Chinese population. And ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were revealed to be important mechanisms of GC.

More recently, the usage of single nucleotide polymorphism arrays provided information of copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity, thus suggesting the occurrence of somatic uniparental disomy (UPD) and uniparental polysomy (UPP) events. The aim of this study is to establish an integrative profiling of recurrent UPDs/UPPs and CNAs in sporadic CRC. Our results indicate that regions showing high frequencies of UPD/UPP mostly coincide with regions typically involved in genomic losses. Among them, chromosome arms 3p, 5q, 9q, 10q, 14q, 17p, 17q, 20p, 21q and 22q preferentially showed UPDs/UPPs over genomic losses suggesting that tumor cells must maintain the disomic state of certain genes to favor cellular fitness. A meta-analysis using over 300 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas confirmed our findings. Several regions affected by recurrent UPDs/UPPs contain well-known TSGs, as well as novel candidates such as ARID1A, DLC1, TCF7L2 and DMBT1. In addition, VCAN, FLT4, SFRP1 and GAS7 were also frequently involved in regions of UPD/UPP and displayed high levels of methylation. Finally, sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of the gene APC underlined that a somatic UPD event might represent the second hit to achieve biallelic inactivation of this TSG in colorectal tumors. In summary, our data define a profile of somatic UPDs/UPPs in sporadic CRC and highlights the importance of these events as a mechanism to achieve the inactivation of TSGs.",2016,"Chromosome Aberrations; Colorectal Neoplasms; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Humans; Loss of Heterozygosity; Uniparental Disomy",5
10344734,VCAN,,Identification of differentially methylated sequences in colorectal cancer by methylated CpG island amplification.,"CpG island methylation has been linked to tumor suppressor gene inactivation in neoplasia and may serve as a useful marker to clone novel cancer-related genes. We have developed a novel PCR-based method, methylated CpG island amplification (MCA), which is useful for both methylation analysis and cloning differentially methylated genes. Using restriction enzymes that have differential sensitivity to 5-methyl-cytosine, followed by adaptor ligation and PCR amplification, methylated CpG rich sequences can be preferentially amplified. In a model experiment using a probe from exon 1 of the p16 gene, signal was detected from MCA products of a colorectal cancer cell line but not in normal colon mucosa. To identify novel CpG islands differentially methylated in colorectal cancer, we have applied MCA coupled with representational difference analysis to the colon cancer cell line Caco2 as a tester and normal colon mucosa as a driver. Using this strategy, we isolated 33 differentially methylated DNA sequences, including fragments identical to several known genes (PAX6, Versican, alpha-tubulin, CSX, OPT, and rRNA gene). The association of hypermethylation of the clones obtained and transcriptional suppression in colorectal cancer was confirmed by examining the Versican gene, which we found to be silenced in methylated cell lines and reactivated by the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. We therefore propose that MCA is a useful technique to study methylation and to isolate CpG islands differentially methylated in cancer.",1999,"5-Methylcytosine; Adenocarcinoma; Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans; Cloning, Molecular; Colorectal Neoplasms; CpG Islands; Cytosine; DNA Methylation; DNA, Neoplasm; DNA, Ribosomal; DNA-Binding Proteins; Exons; Eye Proteins; Genes, p16; Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.5; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Lectins, C-Type; PAX6 Transcription Factor; Paired Box Transcription Factors; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Ribosomal; Repressor Proteins; Subtraction Technique; Transcription Factors; Tubulin; Versicans",5

To systematically evaluate the determinants of immune response in CRC, we explored whether patients with diverse levels of immune cytolytic activity (CYT) have different patterns of chromothripsis and kataegis. Analysis of CRC genomic data from the TCGA, indicated an excess of chromothriptic clusters among CYT-low colon adenocarcinomas, affecting known cancer drivers (<i>APC, KRAS, BRAF, TP53</i> and <i>FBXW7</i>), immune checkpoints (<i>CD274, PDCD1LG2, IDO1/2</i> and <i>LAG3</i>) and immune-related genes (<i>ENTPD1, PRF1, NKG7, FAS, GZMA/B/H/K</i> and <i>CD73</i>). CYT-high tumors were characterized by hypermutation, enrichment in APOBEC-associated mutations and kataegis events, as well as APOBEC activation. We also assessed differences in the most prevalent mutational signatures (SBS15, SBS20, SBS54 and DBS2) across cytolytic subgroups. Regarding the composition of immune cells in the tumor milieu, we found enrichment of M1 macrophages, CD8+ T cells and Tregs, as well as higher CD8+ T-cells/Tregs ratio among CYT-high tumors. CYT-high patients had higher immunophenoscores, which is predictive of their responsiveness if they were to be treated with anti-PD-1 alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 drugs. These results could have implications for patient responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors.",2022,NA,1

Although distinct genomic and transcriptomic profiling of HCC metastasis had been reported previously, the causal relationships of somatic mutants, mRNA levels and metastatic potentials were difficult to be established in clinic. Therefore, 11 human HCC cell lines and 7 monoclonal derivatives with definite metastatic potentials and tropisms were subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS). TP53, MYO5A, ROS1 and ARID2 were the prominent mutants of metastatic drivers in HCC cells. During HCC clonal evaluation, TP53, MYO5A and ROS1 mutations occurred in the early stage, EXT2 and NIN in the late stage. NF1 mutant was unique in lung tropistic cell lines, RNF126 mutant in lymphatic tropistic ones. PER1, LMO2, GAS7, NR4A3 expression levels were positively associated with relapse-free survival (RFS) of HCC patients. The integrative analysis revealed 58 genes exhibited both somatic mutation and dysregulated mRNA levels in high metastatic cells.

Exploiting multilayer genomic data, we focused our interest on the role of aberrant DNA methylation in MTC development.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling assessing more than 27,000 CpGs in the largest MTC series reported to date, comprising 48 molecularly characterized tumors. mRNA and miRNA expression data were available for 33 and 31 tumors, respectively. Two human MTC cell lines and 101 paraffin-embedded MTCs were used for validation.<b>Results:</b> The most distinctive methylome was observed for <i>RET</i><sup>M918T</sup>-related tumors. Integration of methylation data with mRNA and miRNA expression data identified genes negatively regulated by promoter methylation. These <i>in silico</i> findings were confirmed <i>in vitro</i> for <i>PLCB2, DKK4, MMP20</i>, and miR-10a, -30a, and -200c. The mutation-specific aberrant methylation of <i>PLCB2, DKK4</i>, and <i>MMP20</i> was validated in 25 independent MTCs by bisulfite pyrosequencing. The methylome and transcriptome data underscored JAK/Stat pathway involvement in <i>RET</i><sup>M918T</sup> MTCs. Immunostaining [immunohistochemistry (IHC)] for the active form of signaling effector STAT3 was performed in a series of 101 MTCs. As expected, positive IHC was associated with <i>RET</i><sup>M918T</sup>-bearing tumors (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.02).

Small molecular screening demonstrated that fangchinoline (Fan) reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NSCLC cells, inhibiting cell invasion and migration. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of Fan-treated NSCLC cells revealed that Fan potently quenched the NADP<sup>+</sup> metabolic process. Molecular docking analysis revealed that Fan directly and specifically targeted NOX4. NOX4 was associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC in both The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Hong Kong cohorts. In mitochondrial DNA-depleted &#x3c1;<sup>0</sup> NSCLC cells, Fan decreased cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) to inhibit the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway by directly promoting NOX4 degradation. In TCGA and Hong Kong cohorts, NOX4 upregulation acted as a driver event as it positively correlated with metastasis and oxidative stress. Single-cell RNA-seq indicated that NOX4 was overexpressed, especially in cancer cells, cancer stem cells, and endothelial cells. In mice, Fan significantly impeded subcutaneous xenograft formation and reduced metastatic nodule numbers in mouse lung and liver.

We found that the downregulation of TGF-&#x3b2; increased the phosphorylation of several SAPKs, such as p38 and JNK. Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was also increased by TGF-&#x3b2; downregulation, which triggered Akt inactivation and NOX4 increase-derived ROS in a cancer cell-type-specific manner. We also revealed the possibility of substantial gene fluctuation in response to TGF-&#x3b2; downregulation related to SAPKs. The expression levels of Trx and GSTM1, which encode inhibitory proteins that bind to ASK1, were reduced, likely a result of the altered translocation of Smad complex proteins rather than from ROS production. Instead, both ROS and ROS-mediated ER stress were responsible for the decrease in interactions between ASK1 and Trx or GSTM1.

Moreover, in cancer cells that have metastasized to bone, LPA signaling can promote osteolysis by inducing cancer cell production of cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8, which can stimulate osteoblasts to secrete RANKL, a key promoter of osteoclastogenesis. Indeed, in cancers prone to metastasize to bone, LPA appears to be a major driver of the expansion of osteolytic bone metastases. Activation of NADPH oxidase has been shown to play a mediating role in the signaling pathways by which LPA, as well as RANKL, promote osteolysis. In addition, there is reason to suspect that Nox4 activation is a mediator of the feed-forward mechanism whereby release of TGF-beta from bone matrix by osteolysis promotes expression of PTHrP in cancer cells, and thereby induces further osteolysis. Hence, measures which can down-regulate NADPH oxidase activity may have potential for slowing the expansion of osteolytic bone metastases in cancer patients. Phycocyanin and high-dose statins may have utility in this regard, and could be contemplated as complements to bisphosphonates or denosumab for the prevention and control of osteolytic lesions.

Most NUP98 FOs harbor an intrinsically disordered region from NUP98 that is prone to liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro. A predominant class of NUP98 FOs, including NUP98-HOXA9 (NHA9), retains a DNA-binding homeodomain, whereas others harbor other types of DNA- or chromatin-binding domains. NUP98 FOs have long been known to form puncta, but long-standing questions are how nuclear puncta form and how they drive leukemogenesis. Here we studied NHA9 condensates and show that homotypic interactions and different types of heterotypic interactions are required to form nuclear puncta, which are associated with aberrant transcriptional activity and transformation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We also show that three additional leukemia-associated NUP98 FOs (NUP98-PRRX1, NUP98-KDM5A, and NUP98-LNP1) form nuclear puncta and transform hematopoietic cells. These findings indicate that LLPS is critical for leukemogenesis by NUP98 FOs. We show that homotypic and heterotypic mechanisms of LLPS control NUP98-HOXA9 puncta formation, modulating transcriptional activity and transforming hematopoietic cells. Importantly, these mechanisms are generalizable to other NUP98 FOs that share similar domain structures. These findings address long-standing questions on how nuclear puncta form and their link to leukemogenesis.

Hdac inhibitors are used clinically to manage mood disorders, cancers, and other conditions but are teratogenic to the developing skeleton and increase fracture risk in adults. In this study, the functions of Hdac3, one of the enzymes blocked by current Hdac inhibitor therapies, in skeletal mesenchymal progenitor cells were determined. Homozygous deletion of Hdac3 in Prrx1-expressing cells prevented limb lengthening, altered pathways associated with endochondral and intramembranous bone development, caused perinatal lethality, and slowed chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation in vitro. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Hdac3 regulates vastly different pathways in mesenchymal cells expressing the Prxx1-Cre driver than those expressing the Col2-CreERT driver. Notably, Fgf21 was elevated in Hdac3-CKO<sub>Prrx1</sub> limbs as well as in chondrogenic cells exposed to Hdac3 inhibitors. Elevated expression of Mmp3 and Mmp10 transcripts was also observed. In conclusion, Hdac3 regulates distinct pathways in mesenchymal cell populations and is required for mesenchymal progenitor cell differentiation and long bone development. &#xa9; 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",2018,"CHONDROGENESIS; FGF21; HDAC3; LIMB DEVELOPMENT; MMP10; MMP3; RGFP966; VORINOSTAT; Animals; Apoptosis; Bone Development; Bone and Bones; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Chondrocytes; Fibroblast Growth Factors; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation; Growth Plate; Histone Deacetylases; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mesoderm; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Osteoblasts; RNA, Messenger; Skull",3

The purpose of our study was to investigate the SOCS3 status in colon primary tumor and lung metastasis and its relationship with macrophages. The SOCS3 expression pattern and its relationship with the immune response in pan-cancer was investigated using multiple methods. Samples and corresponding clinical information of 32 colon cancer patients with lung metastasis were collected, and the CD68, CD163, and SOCS3 status were conducted using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The relationship between SOCS3 status and macrophage markers was analyzed. Besides, we explored the molecular mechanisms of SOCS3 in lung metastasis <i>via</i> the TCGA database. High SOCS3 expression was more inclined to poor prognosis and was positively correlated with main immune cell infiltration in almost each cancer type, especially in colon cancer. Compared with the colon primary tumor, lung metastasis harbored higher CD163 and SOCS3 expression, and high SOCS3 expression was more likely to be associated with high CD163 expression in lung metastasis. Besides, the exceptional differentially expressed genes in lung metastasis significantly enriched in immune responses and regulations. SOCS3 possessed value as a prognostic marker and target for immunotherapeutic intervention in different tumors and might be a potential target of tumor progression and tumor immunotherapy in colon cancer.",2023,SOCS3; colon primary tumor; immune infiltration; lung metastasis; macrophage; Humans; Colonic Neoplasms; Immunohistochemistry; Lung Neoplasms; Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein; Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins,23

BMMFs have been proposed as zoonotic infectious agents and drivers of indirect carcinogenesis of CRC, inducing chronic tissue inflammation, radical formation and increased levels of DNA damage. Data on expression of BMMFs in large clinical cohorts to test an association with co-markers and clinical parameters were not previously available and were therefore assessed in this study. Tissue sections with paired tumor-adjacent mucosa and tumor tissues of CRC patients [individual cohorts and tissue microarrays (TMAs) (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;246)], low-/high-grade dysplasia (LGD/HGD) and mucosa of healthy donors were used for immunohistochemical quantification of the expression of BMMF replication protein (Rep) and CD68/CD163 (macrophages) by co-immunofluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemical scoring (TMA). Rep was expressed in the tumor-adjacent mucosa of 99% of CRC patients (TMA), was histologically associated with CD68<sup>+</sup> /CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages and was increased in CRC patients when compared to healthy controls. Tumor tissues showed only low stromal Rep expression. Rep was expressed in LGD and less in HGD but was strongly expressed in LGD/HGD-adjacent tissues. Albeit not reaching statistical significance, incidence curves for CRC-specific death were increased for higher Rep expression (TMA), with high tumor-adjacent Rep expression being linked to the highest incidence of death. BMMF Rep expression might represent a marker and early risk factor for CRC. The correlation between Rep and CD68 expression supports a previous hypothesis that BMMF-specific inflammatory regulations, including macrophages, are involved in the pathogenesis of CRC.",2023,bovine meat and milk factors; chronic inflammation; colorectal cancer; infectious indirect carcinogenesis,23

Whether and to what extent immune responses in ccRCC are shaped by genetic alterations, however, is only beginning to emerge. In this proof-of-concept study, we performed a detailed correlative analysis of the mutational and immunological landscapes in a series of 23 consecutive kidney cancer patients. We discovered that a high infiltration with CD8&#x2009;+&#x2009;T cells was not dependent on the number of driver mutations but rather on the presence of specific mutational events, namely pathogenic mutations in PTEN or BAP1. This observation encouraged us to compare mechanisms of T cell suppression in the context of four different genetic patterns, i.e., the presence of multiple drivers, a PTEN or BAP1 mutation, or the absence of detectable driver mutations. We found that ccRCCs harboring a PTEN or BAP1 mutation showed the lowest level of Granzyme B positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). A multiplex immunofluorescence analysis revealed a significant number of CD8&#x2009;+&#x2009;TILs in the vicinity of CD68&#x2009;+&#x2009;macrophages/monocytes in the context of a BAP1 mutation but not in the context of a PTEN mutation. In line with this finding, direct interactions between CD8&#x2009;+&#x2009;TILs and CD163&#x2009;+&#x2009;M2-polarized macrophages were found in BAP1-mutated ccRCC but not in tumors with other mutational patterns.

Moreover, several evidence suggests that chronic inflammation and alterations in stromal and immune cells may contribute to MPN's pathophysiology. We evaluated the frequency and the immunophenotype of peripheral blood monocyte subpopulations in patients with polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (MF). Peripheral blood monocytes from PV (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;16), ET (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;16), and MF (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15) patients and healthy donors (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10) were isolated and submitted to immunophenotyping to determine the frequency of monocyte subpopulations and surface markers expression density. Plasma samples were used to measure the levels of soluble CD163, a biomarker of monocyte activity. PV, ET, and MF patients presented increased frequency of intermediate and non-classical monocytes and reduced frequency of classical monocytes compared to controls. Positivity for JAK2 mutation was significantly associated with the percentage of intermediate monocytes. PV, ET, and MF patients presented high-activated monocytes, evidenced by higher HLA-DR expression and increased soluble CD163 levels. The three MPN categories presented increased frequency of CD56<sup>+</sup>&#x2009;aberrant monocytes, and PV and ET patients presented reduced frequency of CD80/86<sup>+</sup>&#x2009;monocytes.

Prior in situ profiling studies of human CAFs have largely relied on scoring single markers, thus presenting a limited view of their molecular complexity. Our objective was to study the complex spatial tumor microenvironment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with multiple CAF biomarkers, identify novel CAF subsets, and explore their associations with patient outcome. Multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry was employed to spatially profile the CAF landscape in 2 population-based NSCLC cohorts (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;636) using antibodies against 4 fibroblast markers: platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA) and -beta (PDGFRB), fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#x3b1;SMA). The CAF subsets were analyzed for their correlations with mutations, immune characteristics, and clinical variables as well as overall survival. Two CAF subsets, CAF7 (PDGFRA-/PDGFRB+/FAP+/&#x3b1;SMA+) and CAF13 (PDGFRA+/PDGFRB+/FAP-/&#x3b1;SMA+), showed statistically significant but opposite associations with tumor histology, driver mutations (tumor protein p53 [TP53] and epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]), immune features (programmed death-ligand 1 and CD163), and prognosis. In patients with early stage tumors (pathological tumor-node-metastasis IA-IB), CAF7 and CAF13 acted as independent prognostic factors. Multimarker-defined CAF subsets were identified through high-content spatial profiling. The robust associations of CAFs with driver mutations, immune features, and outcome suggest CAFs as essential factors in NSCLC progression and warrant further studies to explore their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. This study also highlights multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry-based CAF profiling as a powerful tool for the discovery of clinically relevant CAF subsets.",2023,"Humans; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta; Biomarkers, Tumor; Fibroblasts; Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts; Mutation; Tumor Microenvironment",23

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are major drivers of immune suppression but their prognostic role, particularly in gastrointestinal malignancies, remains controversial. Lymphocytic infiltration in 122 PDAC samples was assessed by multispectral immunofluorescence with anti-Keratin, -CD3, -CD8, -FOXP3 and -CD163 antibodies. Differential infiltration by Tregs was analyzed in the context of transcriptomic profiles that were available for 65 tumors. High infiltration of CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> (mainly CD4<sup>+</sup>) T cells and, especially, of the subset expressing FOXP3 (Tregs) was associated with improved patient survival, whilst cytotoxic CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration did not have an impact on overall survival. Transcriptomic analysis revealed three signatures in PDAC tumors comprising of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)/stromal, metabolic, and secretory/pancreatic signature. However, none of these signatures explained differences in Treg infiltration. We show that Tregs associate with improved overall survival in PDAC patients. This effect was independent of cytotoxic T cell infiltration and the transcriptomic profiles of their respective tumors. These findings provide a new layer of complexity in the study of PDAC tumor microenvironment that must be considered when developing immunotherapeutic interventions for this disease.",2022,pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); prognosis; regulatory T cells (Treg); tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL); tumor microenvironment (TME),23

Targeting mutated KRAS, the most renowned driver gene in pancreatic cancer, is an active area of study. We discovered a gene named SEMA3C was highly expressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines and patients with a G12D mutation in KRAS. High expression of SEMA3C in patients was significantly associated with the decreased survival of pancreatic cancer patients based on the TCGA database. In pancreatic cancer cells, SEMA3C knockdown or inhibition exhibited growth/colony inhibition and cell cycle arrest. In addition, SEMA3C inhibition sensitized KRAS or MEK1/2 inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells. Overexpression of SEMA3C resulted in the induction of autophagy, whereas depletion of SEMA3C compromised induction of autophagy. SEMA3C modified the PD-L1 expression in tumor and immune cells and is correlated with the M2-like macrophage marker ARG1/CD163 expression, which could reshape the tumor microenvironment. Inhibition of SEMA3C decreased tumor formation in the xenograft model <i>in vivo</i>. Taken together, our data suggest that SEMA3C plays a substantial role in promoting cancer cell survival by regulating the autophagy process and impacting the tumor environment immune response.

Little is known concerning the activity of PD-1 antibodies in locally advanced ACSCC. This study reports on the efficacy and toxicities of a neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade combined with chemotherapy followed by concurrent immunoradiotherapy in ACSCC patients, and describes biomarkers expression and mutation signatures. In this cohort study, patients were treated as planned, including four cycles of neoadjuvant PD-1 antibody toripalimab combined with docetaxol and cisplatin, followed by radiotherapy and two cycles of concurrent toripalimab. Multiplex immunofluorescence staining (mIHC) with PD-L1, CD8, CD163, Pan-Keratin and DAPI was performed with the pretreatment tumor tissue. Whole exome sequencing was performed for the primary tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The primary endpoint was the complete clinical response (cCR) rate at 3 months after overall treatment. Acute and late toxicities graded were assessed prospectively. Five female patients with a median age of 50 years old (range, 43-65 years old), finished treatment as planned. One patient had grade 3 immune related dermatitis. Two patients had grade 3 myelosuppression during neoadjuvant treatment. No severe radiation-related toxicities were noted. Four patients with PD-L1 expression &gt;1% achieved a cCR after neoadjuvant treatment. and the other patient with negative PD-L1 expression also achieved a cCR at 3 months after radiotherapy. All the patients were alive and free from disease and had a normal quality of life, with 19.6-24 months follow up. Inconsistent expression of PD-L1 and CD163 was detected in 3 and 5 patients, respectively. TTN, POLE, MGAM2 were the top mutation frequencies, and 80 significant driver genes were identified.

Therefore, we surveyed genomic profiles of MPLCs and their possible associations with tumor mutation burden (TMB), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and the immune cell infiltration landscape. A total of 112 patients with MPLCs with surgically resected 294 tumors were eligible, and 255 tumors were sequenced using a 1021-gene panel. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to evaluate the levels of PD-L1 and the density of CD3+/CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and CD68+/CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) at the central tumor and invasive margin, and immunotypes were generated based on those variables. MPLCs often occur simultaneously in non-smoker women younger than 60 years and manifest as ground-glass opacities, adenocarcinoma, and stage I lung lesions. The most frequently mutated genes in the 255 tumors were EGFR (56%), ERBB2 (12%), TP53 (12%), BRAF (11%), RBM10 (11%), and KRAS (9%). We found 87 (77.7%) patients with diverse genomic profiles, and 61 (54.5%) who shared at least one putative driver gene between different tumors presented more aggressive tumors. The median TMB was 1.92 mutations/Mb, and high-TMB (&#x2265;3) lesions often harbored EGFR<sup>L858R</sup>/KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/RBM10/TP53/LRP1B mutations or wild-type ERBB2.

Breasts are reportedly affected by ALK-positive histiocytosis. Here, we evaluated 2 localized cases of breast ALK-positive histiocytosis through a comprehensive clinicopathologic, molecular, and genomic analysis to further delineate this entity and better understand its pathogenesis. The cases involved 2 undiagnosed ALK-positive spindle-cell breast lesions. Both cases were Asian women aged 30s to 40s who underwent excisions for asymptomatic breast masses. Macroscopically, both lesions were well-circumscribed, solid masses. Microscopically, both lesions were predominantly composed of fascicles with uniform, bland spindle cells, admixed with epithelioid histiocyte-like cells and lymphoid aggregates. Immunohistochemically, the spindle and epithelioid cells coexpressed ALK and histiocytic markers (eg, CD68, CD163). Genetically, both lesions harbored KIF5B-ALK, confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing analyses. Combining these results, both cases were successfully diagnosed as ALK-positive histiocytosis. Furthermore, no common or previously annotated somatic alterations were identified by whole-exome sequencing. One case harbored clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements according to the polymerase chain reaction-based BIOMED-2 protocol. Therefore, ALK-positive histiocytosis can be accurately diagnosed through a combination of morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular analyses. In this entity, breast cases may have distinct clinicopathologic features: Asian women aged 30s to 40s, asymptomatic masses, and predominant spindled morphology. For pathogenesis, ALK rearrangements could be the driver alteration, and a subset of ALK-positive histiocytosis may harbor a lymphoid lineage. These findings can be utilized to improve the diagnosis of ALK-positive histiocytosis and better understand its pathogenesis.",2022,"Adult; Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase; Biomarkers; Breast Diseases; Female; Gene Rearrangement; Genetic Markers; Histiocytosis; Humans; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion",23

Although JAK/STAT pathway gene mutation, such as STAT3/STAT5B, is the dominant driver in the proliferation of LGLL, immune abnormality remains an unsolved puzzle in the pathogenesis. By means of bioinformatic method through the GEO dataset GSE39838, we performed the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, as well as protein-protein interaction network (PPI) module calculation. As a consequence, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in immune regulation were detected to be related with LGLL, including C1QA, C1QC and CD163 etc. Among all the DEGs, 147 genes were up-regulated, while the number of down-regulated genes was 1,296. In the KEGG pathway of LGLL, infection and immunity were the primary alteration, including tuberculosis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, meticulous experiments are required to validate. To sum up, dysimmunity might be another internal anomaly of LGLL, thus it is a reminder that immune regulation of LGLL should be paid more attention. Moreover, immune microenvironment studies in LGLL covering T, B, and NK cells probably contribute to the molecular pathology, aiming to contribute to the molecular pathology of the LGLL.

Especially the accumulation of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment is known to facilitate tumor growth and to correlate with poor prognosis in many tumor types. TAp73, a member of the p53/p63/p73 family, acts as a tumor suppressor and has been shown to suppress tumor angiogenesis. However, what role TAp73 has in regulating immune cell infiltration is unknown. Here, we report that low levels of TAp73 correlate with an increased NF-&#x3ba;B-regulated inflammatory signature in breast cancer. Furthermore, we show that loss of TAp73 results in NF-&#x3ba;B hyperactivation and secretion of Ccl2, a known NF-&#x3ba;B target and chemoattractant for monocytes and macrophages. Importantly, TAp73-deficient tumors display an increased accumulation of protumoral macrophages that express the mannose receptor (CD206) and scavenger receptor A (CD204) compared to controls. The relevance of TAp73 expression in human breast carcinoma was further accentuated by revealing that TAp73 expression correlates negatively with the accumulation of protumoral CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages in breast cancer patient samples. Taken together, our findings suggest that TAp73 regulates macrophage accumulation and phenotype in breast cancer through inhibition of the NF-&#x3ba;B pathway.",2021,"NF-&#x3ba;B; breast cancer; p73; tumor-associated macrophages; Animals; Antigens, CD; Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic; Breast Neoplasms; Chemokine CCL2; Female; Humans; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; NF-kappa B; Receptors, Cell Surface; Receptors, Immunologic; Scavenger Receptors, Class A; Signal Transduction; Tumor Microenvironment; Tumor Protein p73; Tumor-Associated Macrophages",23

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are major drivers of tumor-promoting inflammation, but due to the complexity of the tumor microenvironment, the detailed regulatory mechanisms are still under investigation. Here, we investigated a novel role for transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) in the development of tumor-promoting inflammation and recruitment of TAMs to gastric cancer (GC) tissues. When estimated by array comparative genomic hybridization and droplet digital PCR, the copy numbers of the TGM2 gene were amplified in 13.6% (14/103) of GC patients and positively associated with TGM2 expression. Gene set enrichment analysis of expression microarray data for GC samples with high or low TGM2 expression showed that increased TGM2 expression was associated with tumor-promoting inflammation in GC. In addition, the expression of TGM2 was correlated with the expression of markers for macrophages, neutrophils, blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels. Overexpression of TGM2 in GC cells augmented the IL-1&#x3b2;-induced secretion of macrophage-recruiting chemokines and NF-&#x3ba;B activation. TGM2 protein levels were associated with the expression levels of the macrophage marker CD163 in human GC tissue samples. Moreover, GC patients with high expression of TGM2 had a worse prognosis than those with low expression of TGM2. These results suggest TGM2 as a novel regulator of the tumor microenvironment of GC and provide a promising target for constraining tumor-promoting inflammation.",2021,"Cell Line, Tumor; Computational Biology; GTP-Binding Proteins; Gene Amplification; Gene Dosage; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Inflammation; Prognosis; Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2; Stomach Neoplasms; Transcriptome; Transglutaminases; Tumor Microenvironment; Tumor-Associated Macrophages",23

As the patient immune activity contributes to treatment clinical benefit, the pre-existing level of immunity at tumor site may provide biomarkers of disease outcome to therapy. Here we investigated whether assessing the density and spatial tissue distribution of key immune cells in the tumor microenvironment could identify patients predisposed to respond to MAPK inhibitors. Pretreatment tumor biopsies from a total of 213 patients (158 for the training set and 55 for the validation set) treated with BRAF or BRAF/MEK inhibitors within the Italian Melanoma Intergroup were stained with selected immune markers (CD8, CD163, &#x3b2;-catenin, PD-L1, PD-L2). Results, obtained by blinded immunohistochemical scoring and digital image analysis, were correlated with clinical response and outcome by multivariate logistic models on response to treatment and clinical outcome, adjusted for American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, performance status, lactate dehydrogenase and treatment received. Patients with high intratumoral, but not peritumoral, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and concomitantly low CD163<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells displayed higher probability of response (OR 9.91, 95% CI 2.23-44.0, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.003) and longer overall survival (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.72, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.005) compared to those with intratumoral low CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and high CD163<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells. The latter phenotype was instead associated with a shorter progression free survival (p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.010). In contrast, PD-L1 and PD-L2 did not correlate with clinical outcome while tumor &#x3b2;-catenin overexpression showed association with lower probability of response (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.21-1.06, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.068). Analysis of the spatially constrained distribution of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD163<sup>+</sup> cells, representative of the opposite circuits of antitumor vs protumor immunity, respectively, may assist in identifying melanoma patients with improved response and better outcome upon treatment with MAPK inhibitors.

We sought to expand the number of molecularly profiled cases and investigate if tumor cell composition could account for the observed low mutation allele frequencies. Molecular (targeted neuro-oncology next-generation sequencing/RNA sequencing and OncoScan microarray) and immunohistochemical (CD68-PGM1/CD163/CD14/CD11c/lysozyme/CD3/CD20/CD34/PD-L1) studies were performed in 7 DIG. Activating MAPK pathway alterations were identified in 4 (57%) cases: 3 had a BRAF mutation (V600E/V600D/V600_W604delinsDQTDG, at 8%-27% variant allele frequency) and 1 showed a TPM3-NRTK1 fusion. Copy number changes were infrequent and nonrecurrent. All tumors had at least 30% of cells morphologically and immunophenotypically consistent with microglial/macrophage lineage.

However, it is poorly understood how tumor cells could functionally modulate TAMs. Our previous work indicated that tumor cell-released autophagosomes (TRAPs), a type of LC3-II<sup>+</sup> double-membrane extracellular vesicles (EVs) was sufficient to suppress anti-tumor immune responses by inducing IL-10-producing B cells and immune suppressive neutrophils. Here, we hypothesized that TRAPs may participate in regulating macrophage polarization. TRAPs isolated from multiple murine tumor cell lines and pleural effusions or ascites of cancer patients were incubated with bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and monocytes, respectively. Cellular phenotypes were examined by flow cytometry, ELISA and quantitative PCR. TRAPs treated BMDMs were tested for the ability to suppress T-cell proliferation in vitro, and for promotion of tumor growth in vivo. Transwell chamber and neutralization antibodies were added to ascertain the inhibitory molecules expressed on BMDMs exposed to TRAPs. Knockout mice were used to identify the receptors responsible for TRAPs-induced BMDMs polarization and the signaling mechanism was examined by western blot. Autophagy-deficient tumors were profiled for phenotypic changes of TAMs and IFN-&#x3b3; secretion of T cells by flow cytometry. The phenotype of monocytes from pleural effusions or ascites of cancer patients was assessed by flow cytometry. TRAPs converted macrophages into an immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype characterized by the expression of PD-L1 and IL-10. These macrophages inhibited the proliferation of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro, and promoted tumor growth mainly through PD-L1 in vivo. TRAPs-induced macrophage polarization was dependent on TLR4-mediated MyD88-p38-STAT3 signaling. In vivo studies indicated that disruption of autophagosome formation in B16F10 cells by silencing the autophagy gene Beclin1 resulted in a remarkable delay in tumor growth, which was associated with reduced autophagosome secretion, TAMs reprogramming and enhanced T cell activation. Moreover, the levels of LC3B<sup>+</sup> EVs appeared to correlate significantly with up-regulation of PD-L1 and IL-10 in matched monocytes from effusions or ascites of cancer patients, and TRAPs isolated from these samples could also polarize monocytes to an M2-like phenotype with increased expression of PD-L1, CD163 and IL-10, decreased expression of HLA-DR, and T cell-suppressive function. These findings suggest the TRAPs-PD-L1 axis as a major driver of immunosuppression in the TME by eliciting macrophage polarization towards an M2-like phenotype, and highlight the potential novel therapeutic approach of simultaneously targeting autophagy and PD-L1.",2019,"IL-10; MyD88; PD-L1; T cell; TAMs; Tumor cell-released autophagosomes (TRAPs); Tumor microenvironment; Animals; Autophagosomes; Autophagy; B7-H1 Antigen; Biomarkers; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Humans; Immune Tolerance; Immunophenotyping; Lymphocyte Activation; Macrophages; Mice; Models, Biological; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88; Neoplasms; Phenotype; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Toll-Like Receptor 4; Tumor Microenvironment",23

We hypothesized that therapeutic use of cornea-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (cMSCs) may alter the function of macrophages. We found that cMSCs can modulate the phenotype and angiogenic function of macrophages. In vitro, cMSCs induce apoptosis of macrophages while preferentially promoting a distinct CD14<sup>hi</sup> CD16<sup>hi</sup> CD163<sup>hi</sup> CD206<sup>hi</sup> immunophenotype that has significantly reduced angiogenic effects based on in vitro angiogenesis assays. In vivo, application of cMSCs to murine corneas after injury leads to reduced macrophage infiltration and higher expression of CD206 in macrophages. Macrophages cocultured (""educated"") by cMSCs express significantly higher levels of anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory factors compared with control macrophages. In vivo, injured corneas treated with cMSC-educated macrophages demonstrate significantly less neovascularization compared with corneas treated with control macrophages. Knocking down the expression of pigment epithelial derived factor (PEDF) in cMSCs significantly abrogates its modulating effects on macrophages, as shown by the reduced rate of apoptosis, decreased expression of sFLT-1/PEDF, and increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A in the cocultured macrophages. Similarly, cMSCs isolated from PEDF knockout mice are less effective compared with wild-type cMSCs at inhibiting macrophage infiltration when applied to wild-type corneas after injury. Overall, these results demonstrate that cMSCs therapeutically suppress the angiogenic capacity of macrophages and highlight the role of cMSC secreted PEDF in the modulation of macrophage phenotype and function.

However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which TAM and fibroblasts contribute to chemoresistance is unclear. In this study, we found that TAM and myofibroblasts directly support chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells by secreting insulin-like growth factors (IGF) 1 and 2, which activate insulin/IGF receptors on pancreatic cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of biopsies from patients with pancreatic cancer revealed that 72% of the patients expressed activated insulin/IGF receptors on tumor cells, and this positively correlates with increased CD163<sup>+</sup> TAM infiltration. In vivo, we found that TAM and myofibroblasts were the main sources of IGF production, and pharmacologic blockade of IGF sensitized pancreatic tumors to gemcitabine. These findings suggest that inhibition of IGF in combination with chemotherapy could benefit patients with PDAC, and that insulin/IGF1R activation may be used as a biomarker to identify patients for such therapeutic intervention.

We selected 56 grade 1-3A FL patients according to their need of treatment or timing of relapse: never treated (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;7), non-relapsed (19), late relapse (14), early relapse or POD24 (11), and primary refractory (5). We analyzed 56 diagnostic and 12 paired relapse lymphoid tissue biopsies and performed copy number alteration (CNA) analysis and next generation sequencing (NGS). We identified six focal driver losses (1p36.32, 6p21.32, 6q14.1, 6q23.3, 9p21.3, 10q23.33) and 1p36.33 copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH). By integrating CNA and NGS results, the most frequently altered genes/regions were KMT2D (79%), CREBBP (67%), TNFRSF14 (46%) and BCL2 (40%). Although we found that mutations in PIM1, FOXO1 and TMEM30A were associated with an adverse clinical behavior, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn, due to the small sample size. We identified common precursor cells harboring early oncogenic alterations of the KMT2D, CREBBP, TNFRSF14 and EP300 genes and 16p13.3-p13.2 CN-LOH. Finally, we established the functional consequences of mutations by means of protein modeling (CD79B, PLCG2, PIM1, MCL1 and IRF8).

In BRCA1 (Breast Cancer gene 1) - or BRCA2-wild type (BRCAwt) HGSOC patients, resistance and progressive disease occur earlier and more often than in mutated BRCA. Identification of biomarkers helpful in predicting response to first-line chemotherapy is a challenge to improve BRCAwt HGSOC management. To identify a gene signature that can predict response to first-line chemotherapy, pre-treatment tumor biopsies from a restricted cohort of BRCAwt HGSOC patients were profiled by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology. Patients were sub-grouped according to platinum-free interval (PFI), into sensitive (PFI&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;12&#x2009;months) and resistant (PFI&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;6&#x2009;months). The gene panel identified by RNA-seq analysis was then tested by high-throughput quantitative real-time PCR (HT RT-qPCR) in a validation cohort, and statistical/bioinformatic methods were used to identify eligible markers and to explore the relevant pathway/gene network enrichments of the identified gene set. Finally, a panel of primary HGSOC cell lines was exploited to uncover cell-autonomous mechanisms of resistance. RNA-seq identified a 42-gene panel discriminating sensitive and resistant BRCAwt HGSOC patients and pathway analysis pointed to the immune system as a possible driver of chemotherapy response. From the extended cohort analysis of the 42 DEGs (differentially expressed genes), a statistical approach combined with the random forest classifier model generated a ten-gene signature predictive of response to first-line chemotherapy. The ten-gene signature included: CKB (Creatine kinase B), CTNNBL1 (Catenin, beta like 1), GNG11 (G protein subunit gamma 11), IGFBP7 (Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7), PLCG2 (Phospholipase C, gamma 2), RNF24 (Ring finger protein 24), SLC15A3 (Solute carrier family 15 member 3), TSPAN31 (Tetraspanin 31), TTI1 (TELO2 interacting protein 1) and UQCC1 (Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex assembly factor). Cytotoxicity assays, combined with gene-expression analysis in primary HGSOC cell lines, allowed to define CTNNBL1, RNF24, and TTI1 as cell-autonomous contributors to tumor resistance. Using machine-learning techniques we have identified a gene signature that could predict response to first-line chemotherapy in BRCAwt HGSOC patients, providing a useful tool towards personalized treatment modalities.",2022,Bioinformatics; Biomarkers; Drug-resistance; HGSOC; Patient stratification; Primary ovarian cancer cells; Random forest classifier model; Transcriptomic; BRCA1 Protein; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Neoplasm Grading; Ovarian Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis,7

Phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC&#x3b3;1) which belongs to phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) family, is activated by many extracellular stimuli including hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors and modulates several cellular and physiological functions necessary for tumorigenesis such as cell survival, migration, invasion and angiogenesis by generating inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) via hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2). Cancer remains as a leading cause of global mortality and aberrant expression and regulation of PLC&#x3b3;1 is linked to a plethora of deadly human cancers including carcinomas of the breast, lung, pancreas, stomach, prostate and ovary.

There are over 20 BTKi, both irreversible and reversible, in clinical development. While loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in the <i>BTK</i> gene cause the immunodeficiency X-linked agammaglobulinemia, neither inherited, nor somatic <i>BTK</i> driver mutations are known. Instead, BTKi-sensitive malignancies are addicted to BTK. BTK is activated by upstream surface receptors, especially the B cell receptor (BCR) but also by chemokine receptors, and adhesion molecules regulating B cell homing. Consequently, BTKi therapy abrogates BCR-driven proliferation and the tissue homing capacity of the malignant cells, which are being redistributed into peripheral blood. BTKi resistance can develop over time, especially in MCL and high-risk CLL patients. Frequently, resistance mutations affect the BTKi binding-site, cysteine 481, thereby reducing drug binding. Less common are gain-of-function (GoF) mutations in downstream signaling components, including phospholipase C&#x3b3;2 (PLC&#x3b3;2). In a subset of patients, mechanisms outside of the BCR pathway, related e.g. to resistance to apoptosis were described. BCR signaling depends on many proteins including SYK, BTK, PI3K; still based on the resistance pattern, BTKi therapy only selects GoF alterations in the NF-&#x3ba;B arm, whereas an inhibitor of the p110&#x3b4; subunit of PI3K instead selects resistance mutations in the RAS-MAP kinase pathway. BTK and PLC&#x3b3;2 resistance mutations highlight BTK's non-redundant role in BCR-mediated NF-&#x3ba;B activation. Of note, mutations affecting BTK tend to generate clone sizes larger than alterations in PLC&#x3b3;2. This infers that BTK signaling may go beyond the PLC&#x3b3;2-regulated NF-&#x3ba;B and NFAT arms. Collectively, when comparing the primary and acquired mutation spectrum in BTKi-sensitive malignancies with the phenotype of the corresponding germline alterations, we find that certain observations do not readily fit with the existing models of BCR signaling.",2021,"B cell receptor; Btk; CARD11; Waldenstr&#xf6;m&#x2019;s macroglobulinemia; chronic lymphocytic leukemia; ibrutinib; mantle cell lymphoma; resistance mutation; Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase; Animals; B-Lymphocytes; CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Guanylate Cyclase; Hematologic Neoplasms; Humans; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Mutation; NF-kappa B; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Phospholipase C gamma; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Signal Transduction; ras Proteins",7

These characteristics include (1) identification in multiple patients with acquired resistance, (2) in vitro validation of drug-resistant properties, (3) mutual exclusivity with one another, (4) increasing frequency over time on drug, and (5) high frequency at the time and site of clinical relapse. Expert commentary: While BTK/PLCG2 mutations have characteristics suggesting that they can drive ibrutinib resistance, this conclusion remains formally unproven until specific inhibition of such mutations is shown to cause regression of ibrutinib-resistant CLL.

Given these differences and the variable clinical presentation and outcomes, we sought to further understand pathogenesis by investigating transcriptomes using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) from multiple primary eBL tumors compared with sBL tumors. Within eBL tumors, minimal expression differences were found based on: anatomical presentation site, in-hospital survival rates, and EBV genome type, suggesting that eBL tumors are homogeneous without marked subtypes. The outstanding difference detected using surrogate variable analysis was the significantly decreased expression of key genes in the immunoproteasome complex (<i>PSMB9</i>/&#x3b2;1i, <i>PSMB10</i>/&#x3b2;2i, <i>PSMB8</i>/&#x3b2;5i, and <i>PSME2</i>/PA28&#x3b2;) in eBL tumors carrying type 2 EBV compared with type 1 EBV. Second, in comparison with previously published pediatric sBL specimens, the majority of the expression and pathway differences was related to the PTEN/PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway and was correlated most strongly with EBV status rather than geographic designation. Third, common mutations were observed significantly less frequently in eBL tumors harboring EBV type 1, with mutation frequencies similar between tumors with EBV type 2 and without EBV. In addition to the previously reported genes, a set of new genes mutated in BL, including <i>TFAP4, MSH6, PRRC2C, BCL7A, FOXO1, PLCG2, PRKDC, RAD50</i>, and <i>RPRD2,</i> were identified. Overall, these data establish that EBV, particularly EBV type 1, supports BL oncogenesis, alleviating the need for certain driver mutations in the human genome.

Using droplet-microfluidic technology and growth kinetic analyses, we demonstrate the presence of ibrutinib-resistant subclones and estimate subclone size before treatment initiation. Haploinsufficiency of TRAIL-R, a consequence of del(8p), results in TRAIL insensitivity, which may contribute to ibrutinib resistance.

We developed a LSD1/HDAC6 multitargeting inhibitor (iDual), a hydroxamic acid analogue of the clinical candidate LSD1 inhibitor GSK2879552. iDual inhibits both targets with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 540, 110, and 290 nM, respectively, against LSD1, HDAC6, and HDAC8. We compared its activity to structurally similar control probes that act by HDAC or LSD1 inhibition alone, as well as an inactive null compound. iDual inhibited the growth of leukemia cell lines at a higher level than GSK2879552 with micromolar IC<sub>50</sub> values. Dual engagement with LSD1 and HDAC6 was supported by dose dependent increases in substrate levels, biomarkers, and cellular thermal shift assay. Both histone methylation and acetylation of tubulin were increased, while acetylated histone levels were only mildly affected, indicating selectivity for HDAC6. Downstream gene expression (CD11b, CD86, p21) was also elevated in response to iDual treatment. Remarkably, iDual synergized with doxorubicin, triggering significant levels of apoptosis with a sublethal concentration of the drug.

Whereas the metastatic melanoma was responsive to ICB, the CLL rapidly progressed (but responded to ICB cessation and ibrutinib). There were no new genetic mutational drivers to explain the altered clinical course. PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 and CTLA-4/CD80/CD86 expression was not increased in CLL B cells, CD8+ or CD4+ T-cell subsets, or monocytes. The patient's CLL B cells demonstrated strikingly prolonged in vitro survival during PD-1 blockade, which was not observed in samples taken before or after ICB, or with other patients. To our knowledge, a discordant clinical course to ICB coupled with these biological features has not been reported in a patient with dual malignancies.",2023,"CLL; Immune-checkpoint blockade; Metastatic melanoma; Humans; CTLA-4 Antigen; Disease Progression; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell; Melanoma; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; Skin Neoplasms; B7-H1 Antigen; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors; Antineoplastic Agents",9

To explore the possible involvement of this mechanism in promoting systemic immunosuppression, the pre-treatment levels of soluble co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory immune checkpoint molecules, as well as those of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were measured in 98 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and compared with those of 45 healthy controls using multiplex bead array and ELISA technologies. Plasma concentrations of the co-stimulatory immune checkpoints, GITR, GITRL, CD27, CD28, CD40, CD80, CD86 and ICOS, as well as the co-inhibitory molecules, PD-L1, CTLA-4 and TIM-3, were all significantly lower in early breast cancer patients compared to healthy controls, as were those of HVEM and sTLR-2, whereas the plasma concentrations of CX3CL1 (fractalkine), CCL5 (RANTES) and those of the growth factors, M-CSF, FGF-21 and GDF-15 were significantly increased. However, when analyzed according to the patients' breast cancer characteristics, these being triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) vs. non-TNBC, tumor size, stage, nodal status and age, no significant differences were detected between the plasma levels of the various immune checkpoint molecules, cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Additionally, none of these biomarkers correlated with pathological complete response. This study has identified low plasma levels of soluble co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules in newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer patients compared to healthy controls, which is a novel finding seemingly consistent with a state of systemic immune dysregulation. Plausible mechanisms include an association with elevated levels of M-CSF and CCL5, implicating the involvement of immune suppressor cells of the M2-macrophage/monocyte phenotype as possible drivers of this state of systemic immune quiescence/dysregulation.",2022,CD28; CTLA-4; GITR; PD-1/PD-L1; TIM-3; breast cancer; co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory immune checkpoints; immune dysregulation; Breast Neoplasms; Chemokine CCL5; Female; Humans; Immune Checkpoint Proteins; Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor,9

This study aimed to provide information on the influences of these mutations. The study assessed 36 protein expression profiles of lung adenocarcinoma (Ex19del, nine; L858R, nine; no Ex19del/L858R, 18). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis together with analysis of variance-based screening identified 13 co-expressed modules and their eigen proteins. Pathway enrichment analysis for the Ex19del mutation demonstrated involvement of SUMOylation, epithelial and mesenchymal transition, ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling via phosphorylation and Hippo signalling. Additionally, analysis for the L858R mutation identified various pathways related to cancer cell survival and death. With regard to the Ex19del mutation, ROCK, RPS6KA1, ARF1, IL2RA and several ErbB pathways were upregulated, whereas AURK and GSKIP were downregulated. With regard to the L858R mutation, RB1, TSC22D3 and DOCK1 were downregulated, whereas various networks, including VEGFA, were moderately upregulated. In all mutation types, CD80/CD86 (B7), MHC, CIITA and IFGN were activated, whereas CD37 and SAFB were inhibited. Costimulatory immune-checkpoint pathways by B7/CD28 were mainly activated, whereas those by PD-1/PD-L1 were inhibited.

The Mtb cell wall cording factor, trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate (TDM), is a physiologically relevant and useful molecule for modeling early macrophage-mediated events during establishment of the tuberculosis-induced granuloma pathogenesis. Here, it is shown that TDM is a major driver of the early M1-like macrophage response as seen during initiation of the granulomas of primary pathology.

Fourty percent of all melanomas harbor a mutation in the signaling adaptor BRAF (V600E) that results in ERK hyperactivity as an oncogenic driver. In these cases, treatment with the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitors Vemurafenib (VEM) or Dabrafenib (DAB) coapplied with the MEK1/2 inhibitors Cobimetinib (COB) or Trametinib (TRA) can result in long-term suppression of tumor growth. Besides direct suppression of ERK activity, these inhibitors have been reported to also modulate tumor immune responses, and exert pro-inflammatory side effects such as fever and rash in some patients. Here we asked for potential effects of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitors on dendritic cells (DC) which are essential for the induction of adaptive anti-tumor responses. Both splenic and bone marrow-derived (BM) mouse dendritic cells (DC) up-regulated costimulator expression (CD80, CD86) in response to DAB but not VEM treatment. Moreover, DAB and to lesser extent VEM enhanced IL-1&#x3b2; (interleukin 1 beta) release by splenic DC, and by LPS-stimulated BMDC. We demonstrate that DAB and VEM activated the NLRC4/Caspase-1 inflammasome. At high concentration, DAB also induced inflammasome activation independent of Caspase-1. TRA and COB elevated MHCII expression on BMDC, and modulated the LPS-induced cytokine pattern. Immunomodulatory activity of DAB and VEM was also observed in human monocyte-derived DC, and DAB induced IL-1&#x3b2; in human primary DC. Altogether, our study shows that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitors upregulate IL-1&#x3b2; release by mouse and human DC which may affect the DC-mediated course of anti-tumor immune responses.",2019,BRAFV600E inhibitor; IL-1beta; Immunology; MEK inhibitor; dendritic cell; inflammasome,9

In this study, we explored the contributions of macrophage-expressed lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) to tumor formation in a K-Ras murine model of lung carcinoma. Myeloid-specific deletion of LDH-A promoted accumulation of macrophages with a CD86<sup>high</sup> and MCP-1<sup>high</sup> M1-like phenotype that suppressed tumor growth. This phenotypic effect was accompanied by reduced VEGF expression and angiogenesis, diminished numbers of PD-L1<sup>+</sup> cancer cells, increased numbers of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, and activation status of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, it was associated with more pronounced antitumor T-cell immunity via induction of IL17 and IFN&#x3b3;-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T (Tc17 and Tc1) cells, likely via suppression of lactate-driven PD-L1 expression. Our results suggest that expressions of LDH-A and lactate by macrophage in the tumor microenvironment are major drivers of T-cell immunosuppression, strongly supporting the concept of targeting stromal LDH-A as an effective strategy to blunt tumoral immune escape. <i>Cancer Res; 77(13); 3632-43. &#xa9;2017 AACR</i>.",2017,"Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Humans; Isoenzymes; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lactate Dehydrogenase 5; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Myeloid Cells; Tumor Microenvironment",9

We still have no understanding on why only some DCIS lesions evolve to invasive cancer whereas others appear not to do so during the life span of the patient. Here, we performed full exome (tumor vs. matching normal), transcriptome, and methylome analysis of 30 pure high-grade DCIS (HG-DCIS) and 10 normal breast epithelial samples. Sixty-two percent of HG-DCIS cases displayed mutations affecting cancer driver genes or potential drivers. Mutations were observed affecting PIK3CA (21% of cases), TP53 (17%), GATA3 (7%), MLL3 (7%) and single cases of mutations affecting CDH1, MAP2K4, TBX3, NF1, ATM, and ARID1A. Significantly, 83% of lesions displayed numerous large chromosomal copy number alterations, suggesting they might precede selection of cancer driver mutations. Integrated pathway-based modeling analysis of RNA-seq data allowed us to identify two DCIS subgroups (DCIS-C1 and DCIS-C2) based on their tumor-intrinsic subtypes, proliferative, immune scores, and in the activity of specific signaling pathways. The more aggressive DCIS-C1 (highly proliferative, basal-like, or ERBB2(+)) displayed signatures characteristic of activated Treg cells (CD4(+)/CD25(+)/FOXP3(+)) and CTLA4(+)/CD86(+) complexes indicative of a tumor-associated immunosuppressive phenotype. Strikingly, all lesions showed evidence of TP53 pathway inactivation. Similarly, ncRNA and methylation profiles reproduce changes observed postinvasion. Among the most significant findings, we observed upregulation of lncRNA HOTAIR in DCIS-C1 lesions and hypermethylation of HOXA5 and SOX genes. We conclude that most HG-DCIS lesions, in spite of representing a preinvasive stage of tumor progression, displayed molecular profiles indistinguishable from invasive breast cancer.",2016,"Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; CTLA-4 Antigen; Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating; DNA Methylation; DNA, Neoplasm; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, Neoplasm; Humans; Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating; Mutation; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Proteins; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Neoplasm; RNA, Untranslated; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; Transcriptome",9

Currently there is an unmet need for new diagnostics and therapies for both forms of this disease. The goal of this study was to utilize Chromatin run-on sequencing (ChRO-seq) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to identify gene and protein expression signatures that may be important drivers of HSA progression. ChRO-seq was performed on tissue isolated from 17 HSA samples and 4 normal splenic samples. Computational analysis was then used to identify differentially expressed genes and these factors were subjected to gene ontology analysis. ChRO-seq analysis revealed over a thousand differentially expressed genes in HSA tissue compared with normal splenic tissue (FDR &lt;&#x2009;0.005). Interestingly, the majority of genes overexpressed in HSA tumor tissue were associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. This observation correlated well with our histological analysis, which found that HSA tumors contain a rich and complex collagen network. Additionally, we characterized the protein expression patterns of two highly overexpressed molecules identified in ChRO-seq analysis, podoplanin (PDPN) and laminin alpha 4 (LAMA4). We found that the expression of these two ECM-associated factors appeared to be largely limited to transformed endothelial cells within the HSA lesions. Outcomes from this study suggest that ECM remodeling plays an important role in HSA progression. Additionally, our study identified two potential novel biomarkers of HSA, PDPN and LAMA4. Interestingly, given that function-blocking anti-PDPN antibodies have shown anti-tumor effects in mouse models of canine melanoma, our studies raise the possibility that these types of therapeutic strategies could potentially be developed for treating canine HSA.",2021,"ChRO-seq; Collagen; ECM; Hemangiosarcoma; LAMA4; PDPN; Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; Chromatin; Chromosome Mapping; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Extracellular Matrix; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Ontology; Hemangiosarcoma; Membrane Glycoproteins; Spleen; Splenic Neoplasms",1

A gap in our understanding concerns the epigenomics of stagewise cancer progression. In this study, we have developed a comprehensive computational framework for the stage-differentiated modelling of DNA methylation landscapes in colorectal cancer (CRC). The methylation &#x3b2;-matrix was derived from the public-domain TCGA data, converted into M-value matrix, annotated with AJCC stages, and analysed for stage-salient genes using an ensemble of approaches involving stage-differentiated modelling of methylation patterns and/or expression patterns. Differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified using a contrast against controls (adjusted p-value &lt;0.001 and |log fold-change of M-value| &gt;2), and then filtered using a series of all possible pairwise stage contrasts (p-value &lt;0.05) to obtain stage-salient DMGs. These were then subjected to a consensus analysis, followed by matching with clinical data and performing Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to evaluate the impact of methylation patterns of consensus stage-salient biomarkers on disease prognosis. We found significant genome-wide changes in methylation patterns in cancer cases relative to controls agnostic of stage. The stage-differentiated models yielded the following consensus salient genes: one stage-I gene (FBN1), one stage-II gene (FOXG1), one stage-III gene (HCN1) and four stage-IV genes (NELL1, ZNF135, FAM123A, LAMA1). All the biomarkers were significantly hypermethylated in the promoter regions, indicating down-regulation of expression and implying a putative CpG island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) manifestation. A prognostic signature consisting of FBN1 and FOXG1 survived all the analytical filters, and represents a novel early-stage epigenetic biomarker / target. We have designed and executed a workflow for stage-differentiated epigenomic analysis of colorectal cancer progression, and identified several stage-salient diagnostic biomarkers, and an early-stage prognostic biomarker panel.

However, cancer cells might become dependent on the normal cellular functions of certain genes that are not oncogenes but ensure cell survival (non-oncogene addiction). The downregulation or silencing of DNA repair genes and the consequent genetic and epigenetic instability is key to promote malignancy, but the activation of the DNA-damage response (DDR) has been shown to become a type of non-oncogene addiction that critically supports tumour survival. In the present study, a systematic evaluation of DNA repair addiction at the pan-cancer level was performed using data derived from The Cancer Dependency Map and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). From 241 DDR genes, 59 were identified as commonly essential in cancer cell lines. However, large differences were observed in terms of dependency scores in 423 cell lines and transcriptomic alterations across 18 cancer types. Among these 59 commonly essential genes, 14 genes were exclusively associated with better overall patient survival and 19 with worse overall survival. Notably, a specific molecular signature among the latter, characterized by DDR genes like UBE2T, RFC4, POLQ, BRIP1, and H2AFX showing the weakest dependency scores, but significant upregulation was strongly associated with worse survival.

We utilized gene expression arrays from 351 MM samples and CytoScan HD arrays from 97 MM samples to identify eight CNV events that represent possible MM drivers. By integrating GEP and CNV data we divided the MM into eight unique subgroups and demonstrated that patients within one of the eight distinct subgroups exhibited common and unique protein network signatures that can be utilized to identify new therapeutic interventions based on pathway dysregulation. Data also point to the central role of 1q gains and the upregulated expression of ANP32E, DTL, IFI16, UBE2Q1, and UBE2T as potential drivers of MM aggressiveness.

Identifying novel drivers of growth and metastasis hold therapeutic potential for the disease. Transport homeostasis between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi and the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) mediated by Golgi have been reported to be closely associated with tumor progression. However, to date, mechanistic studies remain limited. Here, we identified KDELR2 as a potential risk factor with prognostic value in patients with BCa, especially those harbouring the KDELR2 amplification. In addition, we found that KDELR2 is a regulator of BCa cell proliferation and tumorigenicity based on bioinformatic analysis with functional studies. Mechanistically, we revealed that KDELR2 could regulate the expression of KIF20A, thus stimulating the expression of MMP2, MMP9 and MKI67. Functionally, the overexpression of KDELR2 and KIF20A markedly promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and enhanced tumor growth in vivo, while knockdown of KDELR2 and KIF20A exerted the opposite effects. And the overexpression of KDELR2 also enhanced lymph node metastasis in vivo.

KIF20A, a kinesin with unique structural features, is overexpressed in human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) compared to androgen-dependent PC and benign tissue. KIF20A has well-described roles in mitotic processes, but it has a less characterized function in vesicle fission and trafficking within Golgi-driven secretory pathways. Stable expression of KIF20A in androgen-dependent PC cells promoted progression to CRPC through the activation of AR signaling in vitro and in vivo. KIF20A expression resulted in the secretion of autocrine factors in the conditioned media that activated AR and caused castration-resistant proliferation of na&#xef;ve androgen-dependent cells. Pharmacologic disruption of vesicle biogenesis blocked KIF20A-driven castration-resistant proliferation of androgen-dependent PC.

Analysis of molecular-genetic drivers of this disease could reveal new prognostic markers and actionable targets for treatment. To identify somatically acquired genomic mutations in OASeC and explore their associations with metastasis, whole-exome sequencing on DNA extracted from retrospectively collected tumor samples was performed. Thirty-one patients in two orbital oncology centers with OASeC were included. Sequencing results were analyzed to detect mutations and explore their possible association with metastasis. The median patient age was 64 years. A total of 1780 candidate somatic mutations were identified with median mutation rate of 1.0/Mb (range, 0.2-13.6).

The molecular drivers of age-dependent TC onset and aggressiveness remain poorly understood. We applied an integrative, multi-omics data analysis approach to characterize these signatures. Our analysis reveals that aging, independent of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutational status, drives a significant accumulation of aggressiveness-related markers and poorer survival outcomes, most noticeably at age 55 and over. We identified that chromosomal alterations in loci 1p/1q as aging-associated drivers of aggressiveness, and that depleted infiltration with tumor surveillant CD8+T and follicular helper T cells, dysregulation of proteostasis- and senescence-related processes, and ERK1/2 signaling cascade are key features of the aging thyroid and TC onset/progression and aggressiveness in aging patients but not in young individuals. A panel of 23 genes, including those related to cell division such as CENPF, ERCC6L, and the kinases MELK and NEK2, were identified and rigorously characterized as aging-dependent and aggressiveness-specific markers. These genes effectively stratified patients into aggressive clusters with distinct phenotypic enrichment and genomic/transcriptomic profiles.

Currently, several potent small-molecule FLT3 kinase inhibitors are being evaluated or have completed evaluation in clinical trials. However, many of these inhibitors are challenged by the secondary mutations on kinase domain, especially the point mutations at the activation loop (D835) and gatekeeper residue (F691). To overcome the resistance challenge, we identified a novel series of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-thiophene derivatives from a NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) kinase inhibitor CMP3a, which retained inhibitory activities on FTL3-ITD<sup>D835V</sup> and FLT3-ITD<sup>F691L</sup>. Through this study, we identified the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-thiophene derivatives as type-I inhibitors of FLT3. Moreover, we observed compound 5o as an inhibitor displaying equal anti-proliferative activities against FLT3-ITD, FTL3-ITD<sup>D835Y</sup> and FLT3-ITD<sup>F691L</sup> driven acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Meanwhile, the apoptotic effects of compound supported its mechanism of anti-proliferative action.

This study aims to compare the gene expression profiles of tumour endothelial cells from the liver with endothelial cells from non-tumour liver tissue, to identify perturbed biologic functions, co-expression modules, and potentially drugable hub genes that could give rise to novel therapeutic targets and strategies. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) showed that cell growth-related pathways were upregulated, whereas apoptosis induction, immune and inflammatory-related pathways were downregulated in tumour endothelial cells. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified several modules strongly associated to tumour endothelial cells or angiogenic activated endothelial cells with high endoglin (<i>ENG</i>) expression. In tumour cells, upregulated modules were associated with cell growth, cell proliferation, and DNA-replication, whereas downregulated modules were involved in immune functions, particularly complement activation. In <i>ENG</i><sup>+</sup> cells, upregulated modules were associated with cell adhesion and endothelial functions. One downregulated module was associated with immune system-related functions. Querying the <i>STRING</i> database revealed known functional-interaction networks underlying the modules. Several possible hub genes were identified, of which some (for example <i>FEN1</i>, <i>BIRC5</i>, <i>NEK2</i>, <i>CDKN3</i>, and <i>TTK</i>) are potentially druggable as determined by querying the <i>Drug Gene Interaction database</i>. In summary, our study provides a detailed picture of the transcriptomic differences between tumour and non-tumour endothelium in the liver on a co-expression network level, indicates several potential therapeutic targets and presents an analysis workflow that can be easily adapted to other projects.",2021,hepatocellular carcinoma; liver endothelial cells; network analysis; tumour associated endothelial cells,6

However, to date, there are no effective biological therapies against breast cancers that lack these three receptors or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). TNBC correlates with poor survival, in part because they relapse following chemo- and radio-therapies. TNBC is intrinsically aggressive since they have high mitotic indexes and tend to metastasize to the central nervous system. TNBCs are more likely to display centrosome amplification, an abnormal phenotype that results in defective mitotic spindles and abnormal cytokinesis, which culminate in aneuploidy and chromosome instability (known causes of tumor initiation and chemo-resistance). Besides their known role in cell cycle control, mitotic kinases have been also studied in different types of cancer including breast, especially in the context of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is a cellular process characterized by the loss of cell polarity, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and signaling reprogramming (upregulation of mesenchymal genes and downregulation of epithelial genes). Previously, we and others have shown the effects of mitotic kinases like Nek2 and Mps1 (TTK) on EMT. In this review, we focus on Aurora A, Aurora B, Bub1, and highly expressed in cancer (Hec1) as novel targets for therapeutic interventions in breast cancer and their effects on EMT. We highlight the established relationships and interactions of these and other mitotic kinases, clinical trial studies involving mitotic kinases, and the importance that represents to develop drugs against these proteins as potential targets in the primary care therapy for TNBC.",2021,Aurora kinases; Bub1; Centrosome/mitotic kinases; Hec1; breast cancer; epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; Humans; Mitosis; Protein Kinases,6
28112719,NEK2,10.1038/oncsis.2016.88,The role of the cancer stem cell marker CD271 in DNA damage response and drug resistance of melanoma cells.,"Several lines of evidence have suggested that stemness and acquired resistance to targeted inhibitors or chemotherapeutics are mechanistically linked. Here we observed high cell surface and total levels of nerve growth factor receptor/CD271, a marker of melanoma-initiating cells, in sub-populations of chemoresistant cell lines. CD271 expression was increased in drug-sensitive cells but not resistant cells in response to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics etoposide, fotemustine and cisplatin. Comparative analysis of melanoma cells engineered to stably express CD271 or a targeting short hairpin RNA by expression profiling provided numerous genes regulated in a CD271-dependent manner. In-depth analysis of CD271-responsive genes uncovered the association of CD271 with regulation of DNA repair components. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of CD271-responsive genes in drug-resistant cells, among them DNA repair components. Moreover, our comparative screen identified the fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13) as a target of CD271, highly expressed in chemoresistant cells. Further we show that levels of CD271 determine drug response. Knock-down of CD271 in fotemustine-resistant cells decreased expression of FGF13 and at least partly restored sensitivity to fotemustine. Together, we demonstrate that expression of CD271 is responsible for genes associated with DNA repair and drug response. Further, we identified 110 CD271-responsive genes predominantly expressed in melanoma metastases, among them were NEK2, TOP2A and RAD51AP1 as potential drivers of melanoma metastasis. In addition, we provide mechanistic insight in the regulation of CD271 in response to drugs. We found that CD271 is potentially regulated by p53 and in turn is needed for a proper p53-dependent response to DNA-damaging drugs. In summary, we provide for the first time insight in a CD271-associated signaling network connecting CD271 with DNA repair, drug response and metastasis.",2020,NA,6

Deregulation of these processes can trigger chromosome instability and aneuploidy, which are hallmarks of many solid tumors, including breast cancer. Emerging data from the literature illustrated various functions of Nek2 in breast cancer models, with compelling evidence of its prognostic value in breast tumors. The two kinases control distinct steps in the centrosome-centriole cycle and their dysregulation lead to centrosome amplification, marked by the presence of more than two centrosomes within the cell. We found single or composite overexpression of these kinases in breast tumor samples, regardless of subtype, which strongly associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, in a panel of established cell lines, both kinases are highly expressed in Her2-positive breast cancer cells exhibiting centrosome amplification and trastuzumab resistance. In summary, it appears that Nek2 and Plk4 might synergize to promote breast tumorigenesis and may also be involved in tamoxifen and trastuzumab resistance.",2014,"Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinogenesis; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Humans; NIMA-Related Kinases; Prognosis; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases",6

We investigated the genomic landscape of PLC according to the histological classification and established a cross-histological molecular subtyping for PLC by a multi-omics analysis. We analyzed 265 PLC cases with whole-exome sequencing and DNA copy number analyses and 251 cases with gene expression profiling. The cohort included HCC (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;223, 84%), ICC (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;34, 13%), and CHC (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;8, 3%). Mutation analyses identified histological type-specific driver genes, such as CTNNB1 in HCC and KRAS, IDH1, and PIK3CA in ICC, and ARID1A and KMT2C in CHC. The tumor suppressor gene TP53 mutation was detected in 21.1% of HCC, 16.1% of ICC, and 25.0% of CHC cases. Other well-characterized tumor suppressor genes included RB1, which was mutated in 2.8% of HCC and 3.2% of ICC; and PTEN, which was mutated in 1.4% of HCC, 3.2% of ICC, and 12.5% of CHC cases. DNA copy number analyses identified focal amplifications, with NUF2 (1q23.3) the most frequently detected as an amplified gene in all 3 types (HCC, 3.8%; CHC, 12.5%, ICC, 3.2%). Molecular subtyping for PLC based on the multi-omics analysis identified three subtypes, one of which was associated with recurrence after resection and amplified genes located at chromosome 8q.

Therefore, we used a loss-of-function screening approach to help identify molecular vulnerabilities that may represent key points of therapeutic intervention. We employed an unbiased high-throughput lethality screen using a 24,088 siRNA library targeting over 6,000 druggable genes and studied their effects on growth and/or survival of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell lines. The top 300 ""hits"" affecting the viability of A1847 cells were rescreened across additional EOC cell lines and non-tumorigenic, human immortalized ovarian epithelial cell lines. Fifty-three gene candidates were found to exhibit effects in all tumorigenic cell lines tested. Extensive validation of these hits refined the list to four high quality candidates (HSPA5, NDC80, NUF2, and PTN). Mechanistic studies show that silencing of three genes leads to increased apoptosis, while HSPA5 silencing appears to alter cell growth through G1 cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, two independent gene expression studies show that NDC80, NUF2 and PTN were significantly aberrantly overexpressed in serous adenocarcinomas.

32480415,ADH1B,10.1093/bib/bbaa066,Comprehensive analysis reveals distinct mutational signature and its mechanistic insights of alcohol consumption in human cancers.,"Alcohol consumption is a critical risk factor for multiple types of cancer. A genome can be attacked and acquire numerous somatic mutations in the environment of alcohol exposure. Mutational signature has the capacity illustrating the complex somatic mutation patterns in cancer genome. Recent studies have discovered distinct mutational signatures associating with alcohol consumption in liver and esophageal cancers. However, their prevalence among diverse cancers, impact of genetic background and origin of alcohol-induced mutational signatures remain unclear. By a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis on somatic mutations from patients of four cancer types with drinking information, we identified nine mutational signatures (signatures B-J), among which signature J (similar to COSMIC signature 16) was distinctive to alcohol drinking. Signature J was associated with HNSC, ESCA and LIHC but not PAAD. Interestingly, patients with mutated allele rs1229984 in ADH1B had lower level of signature J while mutated allele rs671 in ALDH2 exhibited higher signature J abundance, suggesting acetaldehyde is one cause of signature J. Intriguingly, somatic mutations of three potential cancer driver genes (TP53, CUL3 and NSD1) were found the critical contributors for increased mutational load of signature J in alcohol consumption patients. Furthermore, signature J was enriched with early accumulated clonal mutations compared to mutations derived from late tumor growth.

Mechanisms of diseases induced by alcohol are closely related to its metabolism. Among conventional markers of alcohol abuse, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of erythrocytes is prognostic of alcohol-related cancer and its predictivity increases when combined with functional polymorphisms of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1B [rs1229984] and ADH1C [rs698]) and the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2 [rs671]). Whether these genetic variants can influence abuse in alcohol drinking and MCV has never been examined in drunk-driving traffic offenders. We examined 149 drunk drivers, diagnosed as alcohol abusers according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) and enrolled in a probation program, and 257 social drinkers (controls), all Caucasian males. Alcohol intake was assessed according to self-reported drink-units/d and MCV unadjusted and adjusted for age, smoking, and body mass index. Multivariable models were used to compute MCV adjusted means. Genotype analyses were performed by PCR on DNA from blood. The adjusted MCV mean was higher in drunk-driving abusers than in controls (92 vs. 91fL; P&lt;.0001) and increased with the number of drink-units/d in both abusers and controls (P-trend=.0316 and .0089) already at intermediate quantities (0-1 vs. 2-4 drink-units/d: P=.054 and .024). Carriers of the common ADH1B*1/*1 (rs1229984) genotype were more likely to be drunk-driving abusers (P=.008), reported higher drink-units/d (P=.0126), and had larger MCV (P=.035). The rs698 ADH1C and rs671 ALDH2 polymorphisms were not associated with MCV. ADH1B*1/*1 polymorphism is significantly associated with being a drunk-driving abuser, higher alcohol drinking, and MCV enlargement.

We evaluated gastric intratumoral heterogeneity using multiregional sequencing of &gt;700 cancer genes in 115 tumor biopsies from 32 patients, 29 who were Latinos. Analyses focused on comparisons with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and on mutation clonality, druggability, and signatures. We found that only approximately 30% of all mutations were clonal and that only 61% of the known TCGA gastric cancer drivers harbored clonal mutations. Multiple clonal mutations were found in new candidate gastric cancer drivers such as <i>EYS, FAT4, PCDHA1</i>, <i>RAD50, EXO1, RECQL4,</i> and <i>FSIP2.</i> The genomically stable (GS) molecular subtype, which has the worse prognosis, was identified in 48% of our Latino patients, a fraction that was &gt;2.3-fold higher than in TCGA Asian and White patients. Only a third of all tumors harbored clonal pathogenic mutations in druggable genes, with most (93%) GS tumors lacking actionable clonal mutations. Mutation signature analyses revealed that, in microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors, DNA repair mutations were common for both tumor initiation and progression, while tobacco, <i>POLE</i>, and inflammation signatures likely initiate carcinogenesis. MSS tumor progression was likely driven by aging- and aflatoxin-associated mutations, as these latter changes were usually nonclonal. In microsatellite-unstable tumors, nonclonal tobacco-associated mutations were common. Our study, therefore, contributed to advancing gastric cancer molecular diagnostics and suggests clonal status is important to understanding gastric tumorigenesis. Our findings of a higher frequency of a poor prognosis associated molecular subtype in Latinos and a possible new aflatoxin gastric cancer etiology also advance cancer disparities research. Our study contributes to advancing our knowledge of gastric carcinogenesis, diagnostics, and cancer health disparities.",2023,NA,3

Among these, Exonulcease-1 (EXO1) and DNA2/BLM execute extensive resection of DNA ends to produce 3'-overhangs, which are key intermediates for downstream steps of HR. To help shedding light on regulatory aspects of DNA repair pathways in which EXO1 participates, we set out to identify proteins interacting with EXO1. Affinity purification of EXO1 followed by Orbitrap mass spectrometry led to the identification of novel partners that are involved in RNA processing or that are the causative agents of rare X-linked disorders. Depletion of a selected subset of EXO1 interacting proteins led to reduction of the DNA damage response. Among those, we examined the RRP5-homologue and NF-kappa-B-interacting protein PDCD11/ALG-4, which has roles in apoptosis and is a putative driver gene in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. We provide evidence that depletion of PDCD11 decreased the formation of &#x3b3;-H2AX foci and the phosphorylation of DNA damage response (DDR) signaling intermediates in response to camptothecin or bleomycin, resulting in increased cellular resistance to DNA damage.

For example, loss of either 53BP1 or Rev7/MAD2L2/FANCV derepresses resection to drive PARPi resistance, although the mechanisms are poorly understood. Long-range resection can be catalyzed by two machineries: the exonuclease Exo1, or the combination of a RecQ helicase and Dna2. Here, we develop a single-cell microscopy assay that allows the distinct phases and machineries of resection to be interrogated simultaneously in living <i>S. pombe</i> cells. Using this assay, we find that the 53BP1 orthologue and Rev7 specifically repress long-range resection through the RecQ helicase-dependent pathway, thereby preventing hyper-resection.

In both types of relapse, we observed known and novel drivers of multidrug resistance including MDR1 and MVP, NT5C2 and JAK-STAT activators. Patients with type-1 relapses were specifically characterized by IL7R upregulation. In remarkable contrast, type-2 relapses demonstrated (1) enrichment of constitutional cancer predisposition gene mutations, (2) divergent genetic and epigenetic remodeling, and (3) enrichment of somatic hypermutator phenotypes, related to BLM, BUB1B/PMS2 and TP53 mutations. T-ALLs that later progressed to type-2 relapses exhibited a complex subclonal architecture, unexpectedly, already at the time of initial diagnosis. Deconvolution analysis of ATAC-Seq profiles showed that T-ALLs later developing into type-1 relapses resembled a predominant immature thymic T-cell population, whereas T-ALLs developing into type-2 relapses resembled a mixture of normal T-cell precursors.

In 24 patients, 119 variants were identified in 54 genes. The median mutation rate per patient was 5 (2.8-7). The detected genetic changes were dominated by missense mutations (67%) and nonsense mutations (29%). 18% of the mutations were activating, 35% of the variants led to a loss of function of the encoded protein, and 52% were not classified. Twenty-six variants were described as new. Functionally significant changes in the tertiary structure and activity of the protein molecules in an in silico assay were predicted for 5 new genetic variants. The 5 highest priority candidate genes were selected: CREB1, TCF12, PRKAR1A, BCL11A, and BUB1B. Genes carrying the identified mutations participate in signalling pathways known to be involved in PanNETs; in addition, 38% of the cases showed genetic changes in the regulation of the SMAD2/3 signalling pathway. Well-differentiated PanNETs in a Russian cohort demonstrate various molecular genetic features, including new genetic variations and potential driver genes. The highlighted molecular genetic changes in the SMAD2/3 signalling pathway suggest new prospects for targeted therapy.",2021,Next generation sequencing; Pancreas; Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours; Protein&#x2013;protein interactions; SMAD2/3; Female; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Neuroendocrine Tumors; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Russia; Signal Transduction,5

Here we perform a cross-species analysis by sequencing tumor-germline pairs from 46 primary human muscosal, 65 primary canine oral and 28 primary equine melanoma cases from mucosal sites. Analysis of these data reveals recurrently mutated driver genes shared between species such as NRAS, FAT4, PTPRJ, TP53 and PTEN, and pathogenic germline alleles of BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53. We identify a UV mutation signature in a small number of samples, including human cases from the lip and nasal mucosa. A cross-species comparative analysis of recurrent copy number alterations identifies several candidate drivers including MDM2, B2M, KNSTRN and BUB1B. Comparison of somatic mutations in recurrences and metastases to those in the primary tumor suggests pervasive intra-tumor heterogeneity.

No model is available to precisely elucidate the molecular drivers of this tumor type. HNF1B is a master regulator of gene expression. Here, we report that the transcription factor HNF1B is downregulated in the majority of ChRCC and that the magnitude of <i>HNF1B</i> loss is unique to ChRCC. We also observed a strong correlation between reduced <i>HNF1B</i> expression and aneuploidy in ChRCC patients. In murine embryonic fibroblasts or ACHN cells, <i>HNF1B</i> deficiency reduced expression of the spindle checkpoint proteins MAD2L1 and BUB1B, and the cell-cycle checkpoint proteins RB1 and p27. Furthermore, it altered the chromatin accessibility of <i>Mad2l1</i>, <i>Bub1b</i>, and <i>Rb1</i> genes and triggered aneuploidy development. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database revealed <i>TP53</i> mutations in 33% of ChRCC where <i>HNF1B</i> expression was repressed. In clinical specimens, combining <i>HNF1B</i> loss with <i>TP53</i> mutation produced an association with poor patient prognosis. In cells, combining <i>HNF1B</i> loss and <i>TP53</i> mutation increased cell proliferation and aneuploidy. Our results show how <i>HNF1B</i> loss leads to abnormal mitotic protein regulation and induction of aneuploidy. We propose that coordinate loss of <i>HNF1B</i> and <i>TP53</i> may enhance cellular survival and confer an aggressive phenotype in ChRCC. <i>Cancer Res; 77(19); 5313-26. &#xa9;2017 AACR</i>.",2017,"Aneuploidy; Animals; Apoptosis; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Chromosomal Instability; Embryo, Mammalian; Fibroblasts; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-beta; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Mad2 Proteins; Mice; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases",5

The BUB and CDC family are among kinase genes known recently to help to identify luminal breast cancers with poorer prognosis. Additionally, other CDC kinase genes (CDC42) are associated with luminal A breast cancers with good prognosis. We aimed to investigate the role of these kinases at the protein level within low-grade luminal breast cancers. The Nottingham Tenovus Primary Breast Cancer Series (n=1858) microarrays were immunostained for BUB (BUB1, BUB1B, BUB3) and CDC proteins (CDC2, CDC42) and expression correlated with clinicopathological and molecular variables and patient outcome (SPSS, version 22). On &#x3c7;(2) analysis, cytoplasmic BUB1 and nuclear BUB3 were negatively associated with grade including pleomorphism, mitosis, and Nottingham Prognostic Index, whereas BUB1B was positively associated (p=0&#xb7;05). BUB1 and BUB3 expression was positively correlated with oestrogen and progesterone receptor expression whereas BUB1B was negatively correlated (p=0&#xb7;01). CDC42 had strong associations with tumour morphology within the low-grade luminal breast cancers, tubular and lobular (p=0&#xb7;02). CDC42 nuclear expression revealed negative correlations with basal (CK5) and HER family biomarkers (p=0&#xb7;02). By contrast, cytoplasmic CDC2 overexpression was associated with high-grade tumours (p=0&#xb7;01). BUB1, BUB1B, and CDC42 showed significant associations (p=0&#xb7;04) with breast-cancer-specific survival even at the 15-20-year range, indicating their long-term prognostic potential. These results suggest that BUB1, BUB3, and CDC42 are key kinases for low-grade luminal tumours whereas BUB1B and CDC2 kinases are preferentially expressed in high-grade disease. High protein expression of BUB1, BUB3, and CDC42 in low-grade breast cancers was associated with longer overall survival whereas lower expression resulted in poorer outcome.

36233194,NEIL3,10.3390/ijms231911892,Identification of Candidate Genes in Breast Cancer Induced by Estrogen Plus Progestogens Using Bioinformatic Analysis.,"Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was widely used to treat menopause-related symptoms in menopausal women. However, MHT therapies were controversial with the increased risk of breast cancer because of different estrogen and progestogen combinations, and the molecular basis behind this phenomenon is currently not understood. To address this issue, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the estrogen plus progestogens treatment (EPT) and estrogen treatment (ET) using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. As a result, a total of 96 upregulated DEGs were first identified. Seven DEGs related to the cell cycle (CCNE2, CDCA5, RAD51, TCF19, KNTC1, MCM10, and NEIL3) were validated by RT-qPCR. Specifically, these seven DEGs were increased in EPT compared to ET (p &lt; 0.05) and had higher expression levels in breast cancer than adjacent normal tissues (p &lt; 0.05). Next, we found that estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients with a higher CNNE2 expression have a shorter overall survival time (p &lt; 0.05), while this effect was not observed in the other six DEGs (p &gt; 0.05). Interestingly, the molecular docking results showed that CCNE2 might bind to 17&#x3b2;-estradiol (&#x2212;6.791 kcal/mol), progesterone (&#x2212;6.847 kcal/mol), and medroxyprogesterone acetate (&#x2212;6.314 kcal/mol) with a relatively strong binding affinity, respectively. Importantly, CNNE2 protein level could be upregulated with EPT and attenuated by estrogen receptor antagonist, acolbifene and had interactions with cancer driver genes (AKT1 and KRAS) and high mutation frequency gene (TP53 and PTEN) in breast cancer patients. In conclusion, the current study showed that CCNE2, CDCA5, RAD51, TCF19, KNTC1, MCM10, and NEIL3 might contribute to EPT-related tumorigenesis in breast cancer, with CCNE2 might be a sensitive risk indicator of breast cancer risk in women using MHT.",2022,"bioinformatic analysis; breast cancer; estrogen plus progestogens treatment; menopausal hormone therapy; Breast Neoplasms; Computational Biology; Estradiol; Estrogen Receptor Antagonists; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Estrogens; Female; Humans; Medroxyprogesterone Acetate; Menopause; Molecular Docking Simulation; Progesterone; Progestins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Receptors, Estrogen; Transcription Factors",1

The anti-VEGF antibody, bevacizumab, has been approved for the treatment of recurrent GBM, but resistance is universal. We analyzed expression data of GBM patients treated with bevacizumab to discover potential resistance mechanisms. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and cultures were interrogated for effects of phosphofructokinase-1, muscle isoform (PFKM) loss on tumor cell motility, migration, and invasion through genetic and pharmacologic targeting. We identified PFKM as a driver of bevacizumab resistance. PFKM functions dichotomize based on subcellular location: cytosolic PFKM interacted with KIF11, a tubular motor protein, to promote tumor invasion, whereas nuclear PFKM safeguarded genomic stability of tumor cells through interaction with NBS1. Leveraging differential transcriptional profiling, bupivacaine phenocopied genetic targeting of PFKM, and enhanced efficacy of bevacizumab in preclinical GBM models in vivo.

Kinesin family member 11 (KIF11) is a key driver of malignancy in glioblastoma, a grade IV glioma, but its involvement in glioma chemoresistance remains to be determined. We accessed the TCGA open datasets, collected glioma tumor tissue samples, and analyzed the expression of KIF11 in glioma patients. Meanwhile, the correlation between KIF11 and survival outcomes was determined by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. The role of KIF11 in glioma tumor cell function was assessed in an in vitro knockdown and overexpressing system. Here, we found that KIF11 was upregulated in glioma tumors and negatively correlated with overall survival outcomes via analyzing the open datasets. KIF11 was negatively correlated with TP53 expression. Furthermore, KIF11 promoted the stemness in glioma cells, accompanied by increased cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, we found that KIF11 promoted cell cycle progression via upregulating cyclin expression.",2022,Cancer stem cell; Cyclin; Glioma; KIF11; TP53; Brain Neoplasms; Drug Resistance; Glioma; Humans; Kinesins; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Up-Regulation,6

Thus, identifying actionable targets in treatment-na&#xef;ve and chemoresistant TNBC is a critical unmet medical need. To address this need, we performed high-throughput drug viability screens on human tumor cells isolated from 16 patient-derived xenograft models of treatment-na&#xef;ve primary TNBC. The models span a range of TNBC subtypes and exhibit a diverse set of putative driver mutations, thus providing a unique patient-derived, molecularly annotated pharmacologic resource that is reflective of TNBC. We identified therapeutically actionable targets including kinesin spindle protein (KSP). The KSP inhibitor targets the mitotic spindle through mechanisms independent of microtubule stability and showed efficacy in models that were resistant to microtubule inhibitors used as part of the current standard of care for TNBC. We also observed subtype selectivity of Prima-1<sup>Met</sup>, which showed higher levels of efficacy in the mesenchymal subtype.

Tumor tissue preservation in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound is commonly used in the surgical suite. However, proteins recovered from OCT-embedded specimens pose a challenge for LC-MS/MS experiments, due to the large amounts of polymers present in OCT. Here we present a simple workflow for whole proteome analysis of OCT-embedded NSCLC tissue samples, which involves a simple trichloroacetic acid precipitation step. Comparisons of protein recovery between frozen versus OCT-embedded tissue showed excellent consistency with more than 9200 proteins identified. Using an isobaric labeling strategy, we quantified more than 5400 proteins in tumor versus normal OCT-embedded core needle biopsy samples. Gene ontology analysis indicated that a number of proliferative as well as squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) marker proteins were overexpressed in the tumor, consistent with the patient's pathology based diagnosis of ""poorly differentiated SqCC"". Among the most downregulated proteins in the tumor sample, we noted a number of proteins with potential immunomodulatory functions. Finally, interrogation of the aberrantly expressed proteins using a candidate approach and cross-referencing with publicly available databases led to the identification of potential druggable targets in DNA replication and DNA damage repair pathways. We conclude that our approach allows LC-MS/MS proteomic analyses on OCT-embedded lung cancer specimens, opening the way to bring powerful proteomics into the clinic.

RNA interference (RNAi), which uses small RNAs to inhibit gene expression, provides a promising alternative to reach traditionally undruggable protein targets by shutting off their expression at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level. Challenges for realizing the potential of RNAi have included identifying the appropriate genes to target and achieving sufficient knockdown in tumors. We have developed high-potency Dicer-substrate short-interfering RNAs (DsiRNAs) targeting &#x3b2;-catenin and delivered these in vivo using lipid nanoparticles, resulting in significant reduction of &#x3b2;-catenin expression in liver cancer models. Reduction of &#x3b2;-catenin strongly reduced tumor burden, alone or in combination with sorafenib and as effectively as DsiRNAs that target mitotic genes such as PLK1 and KIF11. &#x3b2;-catenin knockdown also strongly reduced the expression of &#x3b2;-catenin-regulated genes, including MYC, providing a potential mechanism for tumor inhibition.

PC that relapsed after hormonal therapy, referred to as castration-resistant PC (CRPC), often presents with metastasis (mCRPC) and is the major cause of disease lethality. The few available therapies for mCRPC include the Taxanes Docetaxel (DTX) and Cabazitaxel (CBZ). Alas, clinical success of Taxanes in mCRPC is limited by high intrinsic and acquired resistance. Therefore, it remains essential to develop rationally designed treatments for managing therapy-resistant mCRPC disease. The major effect of Taxanes on microtubule hyper-polymerization is a prolonged mitotic block due to activation of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). Taxane-sensitive cells eventually inactivate SAC and exit mitosis by mitotic catastrophe, resulting in genome instability and blockade of proliferation. Resistant cells remain in mitotic block, and, upon drug decay, resume mitosis and proliferation, underlying one resistance mechanism. In our study we explored the possibility of forced mitotic exit to elevate Taxane efficacy. Inactivation of the SAC component, mitotic checkpoint kinase Mps1/TTK with a small molecule inhibitor (Msp1i), potentiated efficacy of Taxanes treatment in both 2D cell culture and 3D prostasphere settings. Mechanistically, Mps1 inhibition forced mitotic catastrophe in cells blocked in mitosis by Taxanes. Androgen receptor (AR), the main driver of PC, is often mutated or truncated in mCRPC. Remarkably, Mps1i significantly potentiated CBZ cytotoxicity regardless of AR status, in both AR-WT and in AR-truncated CRPC cells. Overall, our data demonstrate that forced mitotic exit by Mps1 inhibition potentiates Taxanes efficacy. Given that several Mps1i's are currently in different stages of clinical trials, our results point to Mps1 as a new therapeutic target to potentiate efficacy of Taxanes in mCRPC patients.",2022,"Androgens; Bridged-Ring Compounds; Cell Cycle Proteins; Docetaxel; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Humans; Male; Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Receptors, Androgen; Taxoids",26

In this study, Tat/pDNA complexes were further condensed into smaller, nontoxic nanoparticles by Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition. Formulated Tat/pDNA-Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanoparticles mainly use macropinocytosis for intercellular delivery, and their macropinocytic uptake was persisted in mitosis (M-) phase and highly activated in DNA synthesis (S-) phase of cell-cycle.

One strategy by which tumor cells escape tight homeostatic control is by decreasing the expression of the potent anti-inflammatory protein tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), also known as A20. We observed that tumor cell intrinsic loss of A20 markedly enhanced lung tumorigenesis and was associated with reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated immune surveillance in patients with lung cancer and in mouse models. In mice, we observed that this effect was completely dependent on increased cellular sensitivity to interferon-&#x3b3; (IFN-&#x3b3;) signaling by aberrant activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and increased downstream expression and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Interrupting this autocrine feed forward loop by knocking out IFN-&#x3b1;/&#x3b2; receptor completely restored infiltration of cytotoxic T cells and rescued loss of A20 depending tumorigenesis. Downstream of STAT1, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was highly expressed in A20 knockout lung tumors. Accordingly, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment was highly efficient in mice harboring A20-deficient lung tumors. Furthermore, an A20 loss-of-function gene expression signature positively correlated with survival of melanoma patients treated with anti-programmed cell death protein 1.

Prostate tumorigenesis is a multi-stage process that ultimately tends to advance to become metastatic PCa. Once PCa patients develop skeletal metastases, they eventually succumb to the disease. Therefore, it is imperative to identify essential molecular drivers of this process to develop new therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of this devastating disease. Here, we have identified MAP4K4 as a relevant gene for metastasis in PCa. Our work shows that genetic deletion of MAP4K4 or pharmacological inhibition of its encoded kinase, HGK, inhibits metastatic PCa cells migration and clonogenic properties. Hence, MAP4K4 might promote metastasis and tumor growth. Mechanistically, our results indicate that HGK depleted cells exhibit profound differences in F-actin organization, increasing cell spreading and focal adhesion stability. Additionally, HGK depleted cells fails to respond to TNF-&#x3b1; stimulation and chemoattractant action. Moreover, here we show that HGK upregulation in PCa samples from TCGA and other databases correlates with a poor prognosis of the disease. Hence, we suggest that it could be used as prognostic biomarker to predict the appearance of an aggressive phenotype of PCa tumors and ultimately, the appearance of metastasis.

Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified several modules strongly associated to tumour endothelial cells or angiogenic activated endothelial cells with high endoglin (<i>ENG</i>) expression. In tumour cells, upregulated modules were associated with cell growth, cell proliferation, and DNA-replication, whereas downregulated modules were involved in immune functions, particularly complement activation. In <i>ENG</i><sup>+</sup> cells, upregulated modules were associated with cell adhesion and endothelial functions. One downregulated module was associated with immune system-related functions. Querying the <i>STRING</i> database revealed known functional-interaction networks underlying the modules. Several possible hub genes were identified, of which some (for example <i>FEN1</i>, <i>BIRC5</i>, <i>NEK2</i>, <i>CDKN3</i>, and <i>TTK</i>) are potentially druggable as determined by querying the <i>Drug Gene Interaction database</i>. In summary, our study provides a detailed picture of the transcriptomic differences between tumour and non-tumour endothelium in the liver on a co-expression network level, indicates several potential therapeutic targets and presents an analysis workflow that can be easily adapted to other projects.",2021,hepatocellular carcinoma; liver endothelial cells; network analysis; tumour associated endothelial cells,26

In the current study, we analyzed publicly available transcriptome data from 360 TNBC and 88 normal breast tissues, which revealed activation of nucleosome and cell cycle as the hallmarks of TNBC. Mechanistic network analysis identified activation of FOXM1 and ERBB2, and suppression of TP53 and NURP1 networks in TNBC. Employing Iterative Clustering and Guide-gene Selection (ICGS), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and dimensionality reduction analyses, we classified TNBC into seven molecular subtypes, each exhibiting a unique molecular signature, including immune infiltration (CD19, CD8, and macrophages) and mesenchymal signature, which correlated with variable disease outcomes in a larger cohort (1,070) of BC. Mechanistically, depletion of <i>TTK</i>, <i>TPX2</i>, <i>UBE2C</i>, <i>CDCA7</i>, <i>MELK</i>, <i>NFE2L3</i>, <i>DDX39A</i>, and <i>LRP8</i> led to substantial inhibition of colony formation of TNBC models, which was further enhanced in the presence of paclitaxel.

Here, utilizing the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) mass-spectrometry-based proteomics datasets, we defined differentially expressed proteins and mRNAs associated with higher grade or higher stage, for each of seven cancer types (breast, colon, lung adenocarcinoma, clear cell renal, ovarian, uterine, and pediatric glioma), representing 794 patients. Widespread differential patterns of total proteins and phosphoproteins involved some common patterns shared between different cancer types. More proteins were associated with higher grade than higher stage. Most proteomic signatures predicted patient survival in independent transcriptomic datasets. The proteomic grade signatures, in particular, involved DNA copy number alterations. Pathways of interest were enriched within the grade-associated proteins across multiple cancer types, including pathways of altered metabolism, Warburg-like effects, and translation factors. Proteomic grade correlations identified protein kinases having functional impact in vitro in uterine endometrial cancer cells, including MAP3K2, MASTL, and TTK.

33601912,TTK,10.1177/1535370221991094,Mitotic kinases as drivers of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and as therapeutic targets against breast cancers.,"Biological therapies against breast cancer patients with tumors positive for the estrogen and progesterone hormone receptors and Her2 amplification have greatly improved their survival. However, to date, there are no effective biological therapies against breast cancers that lack these three receptors or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). TNBC correlates with poor survival, in part because they relapse following chemo- and radio-therapies. TNBC is intrinsically aggressive since they have high mitotic indexes and tend to metastasize to the central nervous system. TNBCs are more likely to display centrosome amplification, an abnormal phenotype that results in defective mitotic spindles and abnormal cytokinesis, which culminate in aneuploidy and chromosome instability (known causes of tumor initiation and chemo-resistance). Besides their known role in cell cycle control, mitotic kinases have been also studied in different types of cancer including breast, especially in the context of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is a cellular process characterized by the loss of cell polarity, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and signaling reprogramming (upregulation of mesenchymal genes and downregulation of epithelial genes). Previously, we and others have shown the effects of mitotic kinases like Nek2 and Mps1 (TTK) on EMT. In this review, we focus on Aurora A, Aurora B, Bub1, and highly expressed in cancer (Hec1) as novel targets for therapeutic interventions in breast cancer and their effects on EMT. We highlight the established relationships and interactions of these and other mitotic kinases, clinical trial studies involving mitotic kinases, and the importance that represents to develop drugs against these proteins as potential targets in the primary care therapy for TNBC.",2021,Aurora kinases; Bub1; Centrosome/mitotic kinases; Hec1; breast cancer; epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; Humans; Mitosis; Protein Kinases,26

The early-transformed triple-negative human mammary MCF10AT1 cells were chronically (60 days) exposed to low doses (10<sup>-10</sup> M) of Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a genotoxic agent, and/or Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor. Our study revealed that exposed MCF10AT1 cells developed, in a time-dependent manner, an acquired phenotype characterized by an increase in cancerous properties (anchorage independent growth and stem-like phenotype). Co-exposure of MCF10AT1 cells to B[a]P and BPA led to a significantly greater aggressive phenotype compared to B[a]P or BPA alone. This study provided new insights into the existence of a functional interplay between the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) by which chronic and low-dose exposure of B[a]P and/or BPA fosters the progression of MCF10AT1 cells into a more aggressive substage. Experiments using AhR or GPR30 antagonists, siRNA strategies, and RNAseq analysis led us to propose a model in which AhR signaling plays a ""driver role"" in the AhR/GPR30 cross-talk in mediating long-term and low-dose exposure of B[a]P and/or BPA. Retrospective analysis of two independent breast cancer cohorts revealed that the <i>AhR/GPR30</i> mRNA expression signature resulted in poor breast cancer prognosis, in particular in the ER-negative and the triple-negative subtypes. Finally, the study identified targeting AhR and/or GPR30 with specific antagonists as a strategy capable of inhibiting carcinogenesis associated with chronic exposure to low doses of B[a]P and BPA in MCF10AT1 cells. Altogether, our results indicate that the engagement of both AhR and GPR30 functions, in particular in an ER-negative/triple-negative context of breast cells, favors tumor progression and leads to poor prognosis.",2020,AhR; Benzo[a]pyrene; Bisphenol-A; GPR30; breast cancer; environmental factors; tumor progression,26

However, tumor cells themselves are capable of secreting a variety of inflammatory molecules, leading to the activation of specific signaling pathways that promote tumor progression. The NF-&#x3ba;B signaling pathway is one of the most important connections between inflammation and tumorigenesis. NF-&#x3ba;B is a superfamily of transcription factors that plays an important role in several types of hematological and solid tumors, including breast cancer. However, the role of the NF-&#x3ba;B pathway in the survival of breast cancer patients is poorly studied. In this study, we analyzed and related the expression of both canonical and alternative NF-&#x3ba;B pathways and selected target genes with the relapse-free and overall survival of breast cancer patients. We used the public database Kaplan-Meier plotter (KMplot) which includes gene expression data and survival information of 3951 breast cancer patients. We found that the expression of <i>IKK&#x3b1;</i> was associated with poor relapse-free survival in patients with ER-positive tumors. Moreover, the expression of <i>IL-8</i> and <i>MMP-1</i> was associated with poor relapse-free and overall survival. In contrast, expression of <i>IKK&#x3b2;</i>, <i>p50,</i> and <i>p65</i> from the canonical pathway, and <i>NIK</i> and <i>RELB</i> from the alternative pathway correlated with better relapse-free survival also when the patients were classified by their hormonal and nodal status. Our study suggests that the expression of genes of the canonical and alternative NF-&#x3ba;B pathways is ultimately critical for tumor persistence. Understanding the communication between both pathways would help to find better therapeutic and prophylactic targets to prevent breast cancer progression and relapse.",2020,Breast cancer; KM plotter.; NF-&#x3ba;B; inflammation; prognosis; survival analysis,26

The secondary effects of pathogenic driver mutations on downstream signaling pathways offer a potential approach for the identification of therapeutic targets. We aimed to identify differentially expressed genes as potential drug targets linked to driver mutations. Somatic mutations and the gene expression data of 582 CRC patients were utilized, incorporating the mutational status of 39,916 and the expression levels of 20,500 genes. To uncover candidate targets, the expression levels of various genes in wild-type and mutant cases for the most frequent disruptive mutations were compared with a Mann-Whitney test. A survival analysis was performed in 2100 patients with transcriptomic gene expression data. Up-regulated genes associated with worse survival were filtered for potentially actionable targets. The most significant hits were validated in an independent set of 171 CRC patients. Altogether, 426 disruptive mutation-associated upregulated genes were identified. Among these, 95 were linked to worse recurrence-free survival (RFS). Based on the druggability filter, 37 potentially actionable targets were revealed. We selected seven genes and validated their expression in 171 patient specimens. The best independently validated combinations were <i>DUSP4</i> (<i>p</i> = 2.6 &#xd7; 10<sup>-12</sup>) in <i>ACVR2A</i> mutated (7.7%) patients; <i>BMP4</i> (<i>p</i> = 1.6 &#xd7; 10<sup>-04</sup>) in <i>SOX9</i> mutated (8.1%) patients; <i>TRIB2</i> (<i>p</i> = 1.35 &#xd7; 10<sup>-14</sup>) in <i>ACVR2A</i> mutated patients; <i>VSIG4</i> (<i>p</i> = 2.6 &#xd7; 10<sup>-05</sup>) in <i>ANK3</i> mutated (7.6%) patients, and <i>DUSP4</i> (<i>p</i> = 7.1 &#xd7; 10<sup>-04</sup>) in <i>AMER1</i> mutated (8.2%) patients.

Several gene mutations such as in NPM1 (nucleophosmin 1) are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of AML. The aim of this study was to identify genes whose expression is associated with driver mutations and survival outcome. Genotype data (somatic mutations) and gene expression data including RNA-seq, microarray, and qPCR data were used for the analysis. Multiple datasets were utilized as training sets (GSE6891, TCGA, and GSE1159). A new clinical sample cohort (Semmelweis set) was established for <i>in vitro</i> validation. Wilcoxon analysis was used to identify genes with expression alterations between the mutant and wild type samples. Cox regression analysis was performed to examine the association between gene expression and survival outcome. Data analysis was performed in the R statistical environment. Eighty-five genes were identified with significantly altered expression when comparing NPM1 mutant and wild type patient groups in the GSE6891 set. Additional training sets were used as a filter to condense the six most significant genes associated with NPM1 mutations. Then, the expression changes of these six genes were confirmed in the Semmelweis set: HOXA5 (<i>P</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;3.06E-12, FC&#x202f;=&#x202f;8.3), HOXA10 (<i>P</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;2.44E-09, FC&#x202f;=&#x202f;3.3), HOXB5 (<i>P</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;1.86E-13, FC&#x202f;=&#x202f;37), MEIS1 (<i>P</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;9.82E-10, FC&#x202f;=&#x202f;4.4), PBX3 (<i>P</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;1.03E-13, FC&#x202f;=&#x202f;5.4) and ITM2A (<i>P</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.004, FC&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.4). Cox regression analysis showed that higher expression of these genes - with the exception of ITM2A - was associated with worse overall survival.

Different age groups are characterized by distinct survival outcomes and age-specific alterations of regulatory pathways. Here, we review SHH-specific genetic aberrations and signaling pathways. Over 95% of SHH-MBs contain at least one driver event - the activating mutations frequently affect sonic hedgehog signaling (PTCH1, SMO, SUFU), genome maintenance (TP53), and chromatin modulation (KMT2D, KMT2C, HAT complexes), while genes responsible for transcriptional regulation (MYCN) are recurrently amplified. SHH-MBs have the highest prevalence of damaging germline mutations among all MBs. TP53-mutant MBs are enriched among older children and have the worst prognosis among all SHH-MBs. Numerous genetic aberrations, including mutations of TERT, DDX3X, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway are almost exclusive to adult patients. We elaborate on the newest development within the evolution of molecular subclassification, and compare proposed risk categories across emerging classification systems. We discuss discoveries based on preclinical models and elaborate on the applicability of potential new therapies, including BET bromodomain inhibitors, statins, inhibitors of SMO, AURK, PLK, cMET, targeting stem-like cells, and emerging immunotherapeutic strategies. An enormous amount of data on the genetic background of SHH-MB have accumulated, nevertheless, subgroup affiliation does not provide reliable prediction about response to therapy. Emerging subtypes within SHH-MB offer more layered risk stratifications. Rational clinical trial designs with the incorporation of available molecular knowledge are inevitable.

While studies of selected MLL-fusions have revealed critical molecular pathways, unifying mechanisms across all MLL-fusions remain poorly understood. We present the first comprehensive survey of protein-protein interactions of seven distantly related MLL-fusion proteins. Functional investigation of 128 conserved MLL-fusion-interactors identifies a specific role for the lysine methyltransferase SETD2 in MLL-leukemia. SETD2 loss causes growth arrest and differentiation of AML cells, and leads to increased DNA damage. In addition to its role in H3K36 tri-methylation, SETD2 is required to maintain high H3K79 di-methylation and MLL-AF9-binding to critical target genes, such as Hoxa9. SETD2 loss synergizes with pharmacologic inhibition of the H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L to induce DNA damage, growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis. These results uncover a dependency for SETD2 during MLL-leukemogenesis, revealing a novel actionable vulnerability in this disease.",2018,"Amino Acid Motifs; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA Damage; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Humans; Leukemia; Methylation; Methyltransferases; Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein; Nuclear Proteins; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Protein Binding",26

Mounting evidence suggests that estrogen receptor-alpha positive (ER+) ILC has a poor response to Tamoxifen (TAM), but the mechanistic drivers of this are undefined. In the current work, we comprehensively characterize the SUM44/LCCTam ILC cell model system through integrated analysis of gene expression, copy number, and mutation, with the goal of identifying actionable alterations relevant to clinical ILC that can be co-targeted along with ER to improve treatment outcomes. We show that TAM has several distinct effects on the transcriptome of LCCTam cells, that this resistant cell model has acquired copy number alterations and mutations that impinge on MAPK and metabotropic glutamate receptor (GRM/mGluR) signaling networks, and that pharmacological inhibition of either improves or restores the growth-inhibitory actions of endocrine therapy.",2019,"ESRRG (ERRgamma); Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC); MAPK/ERK (MAPK1); Riluzole; Tamoxifen resistance; mGluR (GRM); Breast Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Lobular; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Gene Amplification; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glutamic Acid; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-alpha; Humans; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Mutation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Receptors, Estrogen; Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate; Signal Transduction; Tamoxifen; Transcriptome; Exome Sequencing",26

Our goal was to evaluate the correlation between mutation in the commonly mutated tumor suppressor gene TP53 and metabolism. We established a database comprising mutation and RNA-seq expression data of the TCGA repository and performed receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to compare expression of each gene between TP53 mutated and wild type samples. All together 762 breast cancer samples were evaluated of which 215 had TP53 mutation. Top up-regulated metabolic genes include glycolytic enzymes (e.g. HK3, GPI, GAPDH, PGK1, ENO1), glycolysis regulator (PDK1) and pentose phosphate pathway enzymes (PGD, TKT, RPIA). Gluconeogenesis enzymes (G6PC3, FBP1) were down-regulated. Oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates were measured in TP53 wild type and mutant breast cell lines with a microfluorimetric analyzer. Applying metabolic inhibitors in the presence and absence of D-glucose and L-glutamine in cell culture experiments resulted in higher glycolytic and mitochondrial activity in TP53 mutant breast cancer cell lines.

However, understanding tumor development requires insights into how these changes cause altered protein function and impaired network regulation in general and/or in specific cancer types. In this work we present a novel method called iSiMPRe that identifies regions that are significantly enriched in somatic mutations and short in-frame insertions or deletions (indels). Applying this unbiased method to the complete human proteome, by using data enriched through various cancer genome projects, we identified around 500 protein regions which could be linked to one or more of 27 distinct cancer types. These regions covered the majority of known cancer genes, surprisingly even tumor suppressors. Additionally, iSiMPRe also identified novel genes and regions that have not yet been associated with cancer. While local somatic mutations correspond to only a subset of genetic variations that can lead to cancer, our systematic analyses revealed that they represent an accompanying feature of most cancer driver genes regardless of the primary mechanism by which they are perturbed during tumorigenesis. These results indicate that the accumulation of local somatic mutations can be used to pinpoint genes responsible for cancer formation and can also help to understand the effect of cancer mutations at the level of functional modules in a broad range of cancer driver genes.

26805938,TTK,10.1039/c5mb00655d,Understanding the functional impact of copy number alterations in breast cancer using a network modeling approach.,"Copy number alterations (CNAs) are thought to account for 85% of the variation in gene expression observed among breast tumours. The expression of cis-associated genes is impacted by CNAs occurring at proximal loci of these genes, whereas the expression of trans-associated genes is impacted by CNAs occurring at distal loci. While a majority of these CNA-driven genes responsible for breast tumourigenesis are cis-associated, trans-associated genes are thought to further abet the development of cancer and influence disease outcomes in patients. Here we present a network-based approach that integrates copy-number and expression profiles to identify putative cis- and trans-associated genes in breast cancer pathogenesis. We validate these cis- and trans-associated genes by employing them to subtype a large cohort of breast tumours obtained from the METABRIC consortium, and demonstrate that these genes accurately reconstruct the ten subtypes of breast cancer. We observe that individual breast cancer subtypes are driven by distinct sets of cis- and trans-associated genes. Among the cis-associated genes, we recover several known drivers of breast cancer (e.g. CCND1, ERRB2, MDM2 and ZNF703) and some novel putative drivers (e.g. BRF2 and SF3B3). siRNA-mediated knockdown of BRF2 across a panel of breast cancer cell lines showed significant reduction in cell viability for ER-/HER2+ (MDA-MB-453) cells, but not in normal (MCF10A) cells thereby indicating that BRF2 could be a viable therapeutic target for estrogen receptor-negative/HER2-enriched (ER-/HER2+) cancers. Among the trans-associated genes, we identify modules of immune response (CD2, CD19, CD38 and CD79B), mitotic/cell-cycle kinases (e.g. AURKB, MELK, PLK1 and TTK), and DNA-damage response genes (e.g. RFC4 and FEN1). siRNA-mediated knockdown of RFC4 significantly reduced cell proliferation in ER-negative normal breast and cancer lines, thereby indicating that RFC4 is essential for both normal and cancer cell survival but could be a useful biomarker for aggressive (ER-negative) breast tumours. under NetStrat.",2016,"Blotting, Western; Breast Neoplasms; Cluster Analysis; Cohort Studies; DNA Copy Number Variations; Female; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genes, Neoplasm; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lymph Nodes; Models, Genetic; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; RNA, Small Interfering; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors",26

Nevertheless, treatments targeting E:C fusion has not been well established yet. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate potential therapies targeting E:C fusion based on systematic bioinformatical analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. One thousand related genes were extracted using transcriptome analysis, and major signaling pathways associated with breast cancer were identified with over-representation analysis. Then, we conducted drug-target network analysis based on the OncoKB and CIViC databases, and finally selected potentially applicable drug candidates. Six major cancer-related signaling pathways (p53, ATR/ATM, FOXM1, hedgehog, cell cycle, and Aurora B) were significantly altered in E:C fusion-positive cases of breast cancer. Further investigation revealed that nine genes (<i>AURKB</i>, <i>HDAC2</i>, <i>PLK1</i>, <i>CENPA</i>, <i>CHEK1</i>, <i>CHEK2</i>, <i>RB1</i>, <i>CCNA2</i>, and <i>MDM2</i>) in coordination with E:C fusion were found to be common denominators in three or more of these pathways, thereby making them promising gene biomarkers for target therapy.

Although genetic alterations have been identified as drivers in subsets of lung adenocarcinoma, they do not fully explain tumor development. Epigenetic alterations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of tumors. To identify epigenetic alterations driving lung adenocarcinoma, we used an improved version of the Tracing Enhancer Networks using Epigenetic Traits method (TENET 2.0) in primary normal lung and lung adenocarcinoma cells. We found over 32,000 enhancers that appear differentially activated between normal lung and lung adenocarcinoma. Among the identified transcriptional regulators inactivated in lung adenocarcinoma vs. normal lung, NKX2-1 was linked to a large number of silenced enhancers. Among the activated transcriptional regulators identified, CENPA, FOXM1, and MYBL2 were linked to numerous cancer-specific enhancers. High expression of CENPA, FOXM1, and MYBL2 is particularly observed in a subgroup of lung adenocarcinomas and is associated with poor patient survival. Notably, CENPA, FOXM1, and MYBL2 are also key regulators of cancer-specific enhancers in breast adenocarcinoma of the basal subtype, but they are associated with distinct sets of activated enhancers. We identified individual lung adenocarcinoma enhancers linked to CENPA, FOXM1, or MYBL2 that were associated with poor patient survival. Knockdown experiments of FOXM1 and MYBL2 suggest that these factors regulate genes involved in controlling cell cycle progression and cell division. For example, we found that expression of TK1, a potential target gene of a MYBL2-linked enhancer, is associated with poor patient survival.

This study identifies epigenetic alteration of the centromere as a potential contributor to the CIN phenotype. The centromere controls chromosome segregation and consists of higher-order repeat (HOR) alpha-satellite DNA packaged into two chromatin domains: the kinetochore, harboring the centromere-specific H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A), and the pericentromeric heterochromatin, considered important for cohesion. Perturbation of centromeric chromatin in model systems causes CIN. As cancer cells exhibit widespread chromatin changes, we hypothesized that pericentromeric chromatin structure could also be affected, contributing to CIN. Cytological and chromatin immunoprecipitation and PCR (ChIP-PCR)-based analyses of HT1080 cancer cells showed that only one of the two HORs on chromosomes 5 and 7 incorporate CENP-A, an organization conserved in all normal and cancer-derived cells examined. Contrastingly, the heterochromatin marker H3K9me3 (trimethylation of H3 lysine 9) mapped to all four HORs and ChIP-PCR showed an altered pattern of H3K9me3 in cancer cell lines and breast tumors, consistent with a reduction on the kinetochore-forming HORs. The JMJD2B demethylase is overexpressed in breast tumors with a CIN phenotype, and overexpression of exogenous JMJD2B in cultured breast epithelial cells caused loss of centromere-associated H3K9me3 and increased CIN. These findings suggest that impaired maintenance of pericentromeric heterochromatin may contribute to CIN in cancer and be a novel therapeutic target.",2012,"Breast Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast; Cell Line, Tumor; Centromere; Chromosomal Instability; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5; Female; Heterochromatin; Histones; Humans; Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases; Kinetochores; Neoplasm Invasiveness",3

We previously identified ATAD2 as a marker and driver of cell proliferation in ovarian cancer (OC); however, the mechanisms whereby ATAD2 is regulated and involved in cell proliferation are still unclear. Here, we disclose that ATAD2 displays a classical G2/M gene signature, functioning to facilitate mitotic progression. ATAD2 ablation caused mitotic arrest and decreased the ability of OC cells to pass through nocodazole-arrested mitosis. ChIP-seq data analyses demonstrated that DREAM and MYBL2-MuvB (MMB), two switchable MuvB-based complexes, bind the CHR elements in the ATAD2 promoter, representing a typical feature and principle mechanism of the periodic regulation of G2/M genes. As a downstream target of MYBL2, ATAD2 deletion significantly impaired MYBL2-driven cell proliferation. Intriguingly, ATAD2 silencing also fed back to destabilize the MYBL2 protein. The significant coexpression of MYBL2 and ATAD2 at both the bulk tissue and single-cell levels highlights the existence of the MYBL2-ATAD2 signaling in OC patients. This signaling is activated during tumorigenesis and correlated with TP53 mutation, and its hyperactivation was found especially in high-grade serous and drug-resistant OCs. Disrupting this signaling by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ATAD2 ablation inhibited the in vivo growth of OC in a subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse model, while pharmacologically targeting this signaling with an ATAD2 inhibitor demonstrated high therapeutic efficacy in both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant OC cells. Collectively, we identified a novel MYBL2-ATAD2 proliferative signaling axis and highlighted its potential application in developing new therapeutic strategies, especially for high-grade serous and drug-resistant OCs.",2023,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Female; Signal Transduction; Cell Proliferation; Ovarian Neoplasms; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Cell Line, Tumor; Trans-Activators; Cell Cycle Proteins; ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities; DNA-Binding Proteins",10

We aimed to define downstream drivers of the KDM5D effect. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of the LNCaP cell line (androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma) with and without silenced KDM5D, MYBL2-binding sites were analyzed. Associations between MYBL2 mRNA expression and clinical outcomes were assessed in cohorts of men with localized and metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. In&#x2009;vitro assays with silencing and overexpression of MYBL2 and KDM5D in androgen receptor (AR)-positive hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and LAPC4, were used to assess their influence on cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle distribution, as well as sensitivity to androgen deprivation, docetaxel, and cabazitaxel. We found that silencing KDM5D increased histone H3 lysine K4 (H3K4) trimethylation and increased MYBL2 expression. KDM5D and MYBL2 were negatively correlated with some but not all clinical samples. Higher MYBL2 expression was associated with a higher rate of relapse in localized disease and poorer overall survival in men with metastatic disease in the CHAARTED trial. Lower MYBL2 levels enhanced LNCaP and LAPC4 sensitivity to androgen deprivation and taxanes. In&#x2009;vitro, modifications of KDM5D and MYBL2 altered cell cycle distribution and apoptosis in a cell line-specific manner. These results show that the transcription factor MYBL2 impacts in&#x2009;vitro hormone-sensitive prostate cancer sensitivity to androgen deprivation and taxanes, and lower levels are associated with better clinical outcomes in men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.",2022,"CHAARTED; MYBL2; androgen deprivation therapy; cell cycle; docetaxel; Male; Humans; Prostatic Neoplasms; Docetaxel; Androgen Antagonists; Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant; Androgens; Lysine; Taxoids; Receptors, Androgen; Minor Histocompatibility Antigens; Histone Demethylases; Trans-Activators; Cell Cycle Proteins",10

Here, we analyzed EIF4EBP1 expression in different glioma patient cohorts and investigated its mode of transcriptional regulation in glioblastoma cells. We verified that EIF4EBP1 mRNA is overexpressed in malignant gliomas, including isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastomas, relative to non-neoplastic brain tissue in multiple publically available datasets. Our analyses revealed that EIF4EBP1 overexpression in malignant gliomas is neither due to gene amplification nor to altered DNA methylation, but rather results from aberrant transcriptional activation by distinct transcription factors. We found seven transcription factor candidates co-expressed with EIF4EBP1 in gliomas and bound to the EIF4EBP1 promoter, as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing data. We investigated the ability of these candidates to activate the EIF4EBP1 promoter using luciferase reporter assays, which supported four transcription factors as candidate EIF4EBP1 regulators, namely MYBL2, ETS1, HIF-1A, and E2F6. Finally, by employing transient knock-down experiments to repress either of these transcription factors, we identified MYBL2 and ETS1 as the relevant transcriptional drivers of enhanced EIF4EBP1 expression in malignant glioma cells. Taken together, our findings confirm enhanced expression of EIF4EBP1 in malignant gliomas relative to non-neoplastic brain tissue and characterize the underlying molecular pathomechanisms.",2022,NA,10

Several transcription factors (TFs) have also been reported to regulate the antitumor activity and immune cell infiltration. This study aimed to quantify the populations of different immune cells infiltrated in tumor samples based on the bulk RNA sequencing data obtained from 50 cancer patients using the CIBERSORT and the EPIC algorithm. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) identified eigengene modules strongly associated with tumorigenesis and the activation of CD4+ memory T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. TF genes <i>FOXM1</i>, <i>MYBL2</i>, <i>TAL1</i>, and <i>ERG</i> are central in the subnetworks of the eigengene modules associated with immune-related genes. The analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer data confirmed these findings and further showed that the expression of these potential TF genes regulating immune infiltration, and the immune-related genes that they regulated, was associated with the survival of patients within multiple cancers. Exome-seq was performed on 24 paired samples that also had RNA-seq data. The expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis showed that mutations were significantly more frequent in the regions flanking the TF genes compared with those of non-TF genes, suggesting a driver role of these TF genes regulating immune infiltration. Taken together, this study presented a practical method for identifying genes that regulate immune infiltration.

Although genetic alterations have been identified as drivers in subsets of lung adenocarcinoma, they do not fully explain tumor development. Epigenetic alterations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of tumors. To identify epigenetic alterations driving lung adenocarcinoma, we used an improved version of the Tracing Enhancer Networks using Epigenetic Traits method (TENET 2.0) in primary normal lung and lung adenocarcinoma cells. We found over 32,000 enhancers that appear differentially activated between normal lung and lung adenocarcinoma. Among the identified transcriptional regulators inactivated in lung adenocarcinoma vs. normal lung, NKX2-1 was linked to a large number of silenced enhancers. Among the activated transcriptional regulators identified, CENPA, FOXM1, and MYBL2 were linked to numerous cancer-specific enhancers. High expression of CENPA, FOXM1, and MYBL2 is particularly observed in a subgroup of lung adenocarcinomas and is associated with poor patient survival. Notably, CENPA, FOXM1, and MYBL2 are also key regulators of cancer-specific enhancers in breast adenocarcinoma of the basal subtype, but they are associated with distinct sets of activated enhancers. We identified individual lung adenocarcinoma enhancers linked to CENPA, FOXM1, or MYBL2 that were associated with poor patient survival. Knockdown experiments of FOXM1 and MYBL2 suggest that these factors regulate genes involved in controlling cell cycle progression and cell division. For example, we found that expression of TK1, a potential target gene of a MYBL2-linked enhancer, is associated with poor patient survival.

Here, we demonstrate in EwS how cooperation of dominant oncogenes and regulatory germline variants determine tumor growth, patient survival and drug response. Binding of the oncogenic EWSR1-FLI1 fusion transcription factor to a polymorphic enhancer-like DNA element controls expression of the transcription factor MYBL2 mediating these phenotypes. Whole-genome and RNA sequencing reveals that variability at this locus is inherited via the germline and is associated with variable inter-tumoral MYBL2 expression. High MYBL2 levels sensitize EwS cells for inhibition of its upstream activating kinase CDK2 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting MYBL2 as a putative biomarker for anti-CDK2-therapy.

It is unclear how cancer cells become aneuploid or how highly aneuploid tumors are different from those of more normal ploidy. We developed a simple computational method that measures the degree of aneuploidy or structural rearrangements of large chromosome regions of 522 human breast tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Highly aneuploid tumors overexpress activators of mitotic transcription and the genes encoding proteins that segregate chromosomes. Overexpression of three mitotic transcriptional regulators, E2F1, MYBL2, and FOXM1, is sufficient to increase the rate of lagging anaphase chromosomes in a non-transformed vertebrate tissue, demonstrating that this event can initiate aneuploidy. Highly aneuploid human breast tumors are also enriched in TP53 mutations.

26510790,MYBL2,10.1534/genetics.115.180125,A Gene Regulatory Program in Human Breast Cancer.,"Molecular heterogeneity in human breast cancer has challenged diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical treatment. It is well known that molecular subtypes of breast tumors are associated with significant differences in prognosis and survival. Assuming that the differences are attributed to subtype-specific pathways, we then suspect that there might be gene regulatory mechanisms that modulate the behavior of the pathways and their interactions. In this study, we proposed an integrated methodology, including machine learning and information theory, to explore the mechanisms. Using existing data from three large cohorts of human breast cancer populations, we have identified an ensemble of 16 master regulator genes (or MR16) that can discriminate breast tumor samples into four major subtypes. Evidence from gene expression across the three cohorts has consistently indicated that the MR16 can be divided into two groups that demonstrate subtype-specific gene expression patterns. For example, group 1 MRs, including ESR1, FOXA1, and GATA3, are overexpressed in luminal A and luminal B subtypes, but lowly expressed in HER2-enriched and basal-like subtypes. In contrast, group 2 MRs, including FOXM1, EZH2, MYBL2, and ZNF695, display an opposite pattern. Furthermore, evidence from mutual information modeling has congruently indicated that the two groups of MRs either up- or down-regulate cancer driver-related genes in opposite directions. Furthermore, integration of somatic mutations with pathway changes leads to identification of canonical genomic alternations in a subtype-specific fashion.

In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), FoxA1 acts as an androgen receptor cofactor to drive G&#x2082; to M-phase cell-cycle transit. Here, we describe a mechanistically distinct SR-independent role for FoxA1 in driving G&#x2081; to S-phase cell-cycle transit in CRPC. By comparing FoxA1 binding sites in prostate cancer cell genomes, we defined a codependent set of FoxA1-MYBL2 and FoxA1-CREB1 binding sites within the regulatory regions of the Cyclin E2 and E2F1 genes that are critical for CRPC growth. Binding at these sites upregulate the Cyclin E2 and Cyclin A2 genes in CRPC but not in earlier stage androgen-dependent prostate cancer, establishing a stage-specific role for this pathway in CRPC growth. Mechanistic investigations indicated that FoxA1, MYBL2, or CREB1 induction of histone H3 acetylation facilitated nucleosome disruption as the basis for codependent transcriptional activation and G&#x2081; to S-phase cell-cycle transit.

Cells lacking PPP6C, the catalytic subunit of PP6, have amplified Aurora A activity, and as we show here, enlarged mitotic spindles which fail to hold chromosomes tightly together in anaphase, causing defective nuclear structure. Using functional genomics to shed light on the processes underpinning these changes, we discover synthetic lethality between PPP6C and the kinetochore protein NDC80. We find that NDC80 is phosphorylated on multiple N-terminal sites during spindle formation by Aurora A-TPX2, exclusively at checkpoint-silenced, microtubule-attached kinetochores. NDC80 phosphorylation persists until spindle disassembly in telophase, is increased in PPP6C knockout cells, and is Aurora B-independent. An Aurora-phosphorylation-deficient NDC80-9A mutant reduces spindle size and suppresses defective nuclear structure in PPP6C knockout cells. In regulating NDC80 phosphorylation by Aurora A-TPX2, PP6 plays an important role in mitotic spindle formation and size control and thus the fidelity of cell division.",2023,Cell Cycle Proteins; Kinetochores; Microtubules; Mitosis; Nuclear Proteins; Phosphoprotein Phosphatases; Phosphorylation; Spindle Apparatus; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Aurora Kinase A; Microtubule-Associated Proteins,13

The gut is considered a unique organ with its distinctive neuronal supply. The neuropeptide, human galanin, is widely distributed in the colon and expressed in many cancers, including the CRC. The current study aimed to explore the role of galanin at different stages of CRC. Eighty-one CRC cases (TNM stages I - IV) were recruited, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples were analyzed for the expression of galanin and galanin receptor 1 (GALR1) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Galanin intensity was significantly lower in stage IV (n= 6) in comparison to other stages (p= 0.037 using the Mann-Whitney U test). Whole transcriptomics analysis using NGS was performed for selected samples based on the galanin expression by IHC [early (n=5) with high galanin expression and late (n=6) with low galanin expression]. Five differentially regulated pathways (using Absolute GSEA) were identified as drivers for tumor progression and associated with higher galanin expression, namely, cell cycle, cell division, autophagy, transcriptional regulation of TP53, and immune system process. The top shared genes among the upregulated pathways are <i>AURKA, BIRC5, CCNA1, CCNA2, CDC25C, CDK2, CDK6, EREG, LIG3, PIN1, TGFB1, TPX2</i>. The results were validated using real-time PCR carried out on four cell lines [two primaries (HCT116 and HT29) and two metastatic (LoVo and SK-Co-1)].

Great advances have been made over the last decades, however, most studies predict driver genes of breast cancer using biological experiments and/or computational methods, regardless of stage information. In this study, we propose a computational framework to predict the disease genes of breast cancer based on stage-specific gene regulatory networks. Firstly, we screen out differentially expressed genes and hypomethylated/hypermethylated genes by comparing tumor samples with corresponding normal samples. Secondly, we construct three stage-specific gene regulatory networks by integrating RNA-seq profiles and TF-target pairs, and apply WGCNA to detect modules from these networks. Subsequently, we perform network topological analysis and gene set enrichment analysis. Finally, the key genes of specific modules for each stage are screened as candidate disease genes. We obtain seven stage-specific modules, and identify 20, 12, and 22 key genes for three stages, respectively. Furthermore, 55%, 83%, and 64% of the genes are associated with breast cancer, for example <i>E2F2</i>, <i>E2F8</i>, <i>TPX2</i>, <i>BUB1</i>, and <i>CKAP2L</i>.

Herein, we aimed to identify driver genes and signaling pathways relevant to GIST progression. We investigated genetic profiles of 707 driver genes, including mutations, gene fusions, copy number gain or loss, and gene expression for 65 clinical specimens of surgically dissected GIST, consisting of six metastatic tumors and 59 primary tumors from stomach, small intestine, rectum, and esophagus. Genetic alterations included oncogenic mutations and amplification-dependent expression enhancement for oncogenes (OG), and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and expression reduction for tumor suppressor genes (TSG). We assigned activated OG and inactivated TSG to 27 signaling pathways, the activation of which was compared between malignant GIST (metastasis and high-risk GIST) and less malignant GIST (low- and very low-risk GIST). Integrative molecular profiling indicated that a greater incidence of genetic alterations of driver genes was detected in malignant GIST (96%, 22 of 23) than in less malignant GIST (73%, 24 of 33). Malignant GIST samples groups showed mutations, LOH, and aberrant expression dominantly in driver genes associated with signaling pathways of PI3K (PIK3CA, AKT1, and PTEN) and the cell cycle (RB1, CDK4, and CDKN1B). Additionally, we identified potential PI3K-related genes, the expression of which was upregulated (SNAI1 and TPX2) or downregulated (BANK1) in malignant GIST.

Molecular discordance between primary and metastatic TNBC has been observed, but the degree of biological heterogeneity has not been fully explored. Furthermore, genomic evolution through treatment is poorly understood. In this study, we aim to characterize the genomic changes between paired primary and metastatic TNBCs through transcriptomic and genomic profiling, and to identify genomic alterations which may contribute to chemotherapy resistance. Genomic alterations and mRNA expression of 10 paired primary and metastatic TNBCs were determined through targeted sequencing, microarray analysis, and RNA sequencing. Commonly mutated genes, as well as differentially expressed and co-expressed genes were identified. We further explored the clinical relevance of differentially expressed genes between primary and metastatic tumors to patient survival using large public datasets. Through gene expression profiling, we observed a shift in TNBC subtype classifications between primary and metastatic TNBCs. A panel of eight cancer driver genes (CCNE1, TPX2, ELF3, FANCL, JAK2, GSK3B, CEP76, and SYK) were differentially expressed in recurrent TNBCs, and were also overexpressed in TCGA and METABRIC. CCNE1 and TPX2 were co-overexpressed in TNBCs.

Although elevated expression of AURKA has been shown to induce oncogenic phenotypes in cells in vitro, findings from transgenic mouse models of Aurora-A overexpression in mammary glands have been distinct depending on the models generated. In the present study, we report that prolonged overexpression of AURKA transgene in mammary epithelium driven by ovine &#x3b2;-lactoglobulin promoter, activated through multiple pregnancy and lactation cycles, results in the development of mammary adenocarcinomas with alterations in cancer-relevant genes and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. The tumor incidence was 38.9% (7/18) in Aurora-A transgenic mice at 16 months of age following 4-5 pregnancy cycles. Aurora-A overexpression in the tumor tissues accompanied activation of Akt, elevation of Cyclin D1, Tpx2 and Plk1 along with downregulation of ER&#x3b1; and p53 proteins, albeit at varying levels. Microarray comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses of transgenic mouse mammary adenocarcinomas revealed copy gain of Glp1r and losses of Ercc5, Pten and Tcf7l2 loci. Review of human breast tumor transcriptomic data sets showed association of these genes at varying levels with Aurora-A gain of function alterations. Whole exome sequencing of the mouse tumors also identified gene mutations detected in Aurora-A overexpressing human breast cancers. Our findings demonstrate that prolonged overexpression of Aurora-A can be a driver somatic genetic event in mammary adenocarcinomas associated with deregulated tumor-relevant pathways in the Aurora-A subset of human breast cancer.",2017,"Adenocarcinoma; Animals; Aurora Kinase A; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Epithelium; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Mammary Glands, Animal; Mammary Neoplasms, Animal; Mice; Neoplasm Proteins; Pregnancy",13
25632068,TPX2,10.1093/annonc/mdv034,The AURKA/TPX2 axis drives colon tumorigenesis cooperatively with MYC.,"The MYC oncogene has long been established as a central driver in many types of human cancers including colorectal cancer. However, the realization of MYC-targeting therapies remains elusive; as a result, synthetic lethal therapeutic approaches are alternatively being explored. A synthetic lethal therapeutic approach aims to kill MYC-driven tumors by targeting a certain co-regulator on the MYC pathway. We analyzed copy number and expression profiles from 130 colorectal cancer tumors together with publicly available datasets to identify co-regulators on the MYC pathway. Candidates were functionally tested by in vitro assays using colorectal cancer and normal fibroblast cell lines. Additionally, survival analyses were carried out on another 159 colorectal cancer patients and public datasets. Our in silico screening identified two MYC co-regulator candidates, AURKA and TPX2, which are interacting mitotic regulators located on chromosome 20q. We found the two candidates showed frequent co-amplification with the MYC locus while expression levels of MYC and the two genes were positively correlated with those of MYC downstream target genes across multiple cancer types. In vitro, the aberrant expression of MYC, AURKA and TPX2 resulted in more aggressive anchorage-independent growth in normal fibroblast cells. Furthermore, knockdown of AURKA or TPX2, or treatment with an AURKA-specific inhibitor effectively suppressed the proliferation of MYC-expressing colorectal cancer cells. Additionally, combined high expression of MYC, AURKA and TPX2 proved to be a poor prognostic indicator of colorectal cancer patient survival. Through bioinformatic analyses and experiments, we proposed TPX2 and AURKA as novel co-regulators on the MYC pathway. Inhibiting the AURKA/TPX2 axis would be a novel synthetic lethal therapeutic approach for MYC-driven cancers.",2016,"AURKA; MYC; TPX2; co-amplification; synthetic lethality; Antineoplastic Agents; Aurora Kinase A; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8; Colorectal Neoplasms; Computational Biology; Gene Amplification; Gene Dosage; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; HCT116 Cells; Humans; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Nuclear Proteins; Prognosis; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; RNA Interference; Signal Transduction; Survival Analysis; Time Factors; Transfection",13

In the majority of cases, this is associated with gain of a substantial part of chromosome 20q, indicating that multiple genes on the 20q amplicon may drive carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to identify genes located on the 20q amplicon that promote progression of colorectal adenoma to carcinoma. Functional assays were performed for 32 candidate driver genes for which a positive correlation between 20q DNA copy number and mRNA expression had been demonstrated. Effects of gene knockdown on cell viability, anchorage-independent growth, and invasion were analysed in colorectal cancer cell lines with 20q gain. Colorectal tumour protein expression was examined by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays. TPX2, AURKA, CSE1L, DIDO1, HM13, TCFL5, SLC17A9, RBM39 and PRPF6 affected cell viability and/or anchorage-independent growth. Chromosome 20q DNA copy number status correlated significantly with TPX2 and AURKA protein levels in a series of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas. Moreover, downmodulation of TPX2 and AURKA was shown to inhibit invasion. These data identify TPX2 (20q11) and AURKA (20q13.2) as two genes located on distinct regions of chromosome 20q that promote 20q amplicon-driven progression of colorectal adenoma to carcinoma. Therefore the selection advantage imposed by 20q gain in tumour progression is achieved by gain-of-function of multiple cancer-related genes-knowledge that can be translated into novel tests for early diagnosis of progressive adenomas.",2012,"Adenocarcinoma; Adenoma; Aurora Kinase A; Aurora Kinases; Biopsy, Needle; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20; Colorectal Neoplasms; DNA Copy Number Variations; Disease Progression; Female; Gene Amplification; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Nuclear Proteins; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; RNA, Neoplasm; Sampling Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tumor Cells, Cultured",13

We systematically attenuated expression of genes within the minimally defined 19q12 region in ovarian cell lines using short-interfering RNAs (siRNA) to identify driver oncogene(s) within the amplicon. Knockdown of CCNE1 resulted in G1/S phase arrest, reduced cell viability and apoptosis only in amplification-carrying cells. Although CCNE1 knockdown increased cisplatin resistance in short-term assays, clonogenic survival was inhibited after treatment. Gain of 20q11 was highly correlated with 19q12 amplification and spanned a 2.5 Mb region including TPX2, a centromeric protein required for mitotic spindle function. Expression of TPX2 was highly correlated with gene amplification and with CCNE1 expression in primary tumors. siRNA inhibition of TPX2 reduced cell viability but this effect was not amplicon-dependent. These findings demonstrate that CCNE1 is a key driver in the 19q12 amplicon required for survival and clonogenicity in cells with locus amplification. Co-amplification at 19q12 and 20q11 implies the presence of a cooperative mutational network. These observations have implications for the application of targeted therapies in CCNE1 dependent ovarian cancers.",2011,"Antineoplastic Agents; Blotting, Western; Cell Cycle; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Chromosome Aberrations; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20; Cisplatin; Cyclin E; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Gene Amplification; Humans; Oncogene Proteins; Ovarian Neoplasms; RNA Interference; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction",13

Cataloguing these target genes will provide useful insights into the disease etiology and may provide an opportunity to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. High resolution genome wide copy number and matching expression data from 68 primary epithelial ovarian carcinomas of various histotypes was integrated to identify genes in regions of most frequent amplification with the strongest correlation with expression and copy number.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Somatic mutation screening was performed using the whole-exome sequencing of osteosarcoma samples, and the distribution of mutations was demonstrated by Circos diagrams. Metascape was used to analyze the GO and KEGG signal pathway enrichment of the genes harboring protein coding alterations, and GeneMANIA was used to analyze the interaction of mutated genes. RESULTS The results showed that the protein coding alterations were found throughout the whole genome in 3 osteosarcoma samples. A large number of identical or related biological processes and pathways were found in osteosarcoma samples. The GeneMANIA analysis of the 10 mutations shared by 3 samples showed that the target gene minichromosome maintenance complex component 4 (MCM4) and 3 lateral genes were most functional, and were all related to DNA replication. The analysis of GO and KEGG signal pathway enrichment showed that the mutated genes were involved mainly in tumor-related metabolic pathways. Three mutated genes were involved in the cell process, and 2 mutated genes were involved in the metabolic process. Known driver gene mutations were also observed in the samples. CONCLUSIONS The gene analysis confirmed that patients with osteosarcoma had a wide range of common gene mutations related to each other, which are involved in tumor-related metabolic pathways. These findings provide a basis for further gene-targeted therapy and pathway research.",2020,Bone Neoplasms; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Mutation; Osteosarcoma; Signal Transduction; Exome Sequencing,3

Although many oncogenes and tumor suppressors have been uncovered in the past decades, the pathogenesis and mechanisms of lung tumorigenesis and progression are unclear. The advancement of high-throughput sequencing technique and bioinformatics methods has led to the discovery of some unknown important protein-coding genes or noncoding RNAs in human cancers. In this study, we tried to identify and validate lung cancer driver genes to facilitate the diagnosis and individualized treatment of patients with this disease. To analyze distinct gene profile in lung cancer, the RNA sequencing data from TCGA and microarray data from Gene Expression Omnibus were used. Then, shRNA-pooled screen data and CRISPR-Cas9-based screen data in lung cancer cells were used to validate the functional roles of identified genes. We found that thousands of gene expression patterns are altered in lung cancer, and genomic alterations contribute to the dysregulation of these genes. Furthermore, we identified some potential lung cancer driver genes, such as TBX2, MCM4, SLC2A1, BIRC5, and CDC20, whose expression is significantly upregulated in lung cancer, and the copy number of these genes is amplified in the genome of patients with lung cancer. More importantly, overexpression of these genes is associated with poorer survival of patients with lung cancer, and knockdown or knockout of these genes results in decreased cell proliferation in lung cancer cells. Taken together, the genomewide comprehensive analysis combined with screen data analyses may provide a valuable help for identifying cancer driver genes for diagnosis and prevention of patients with lung cancer.",2018,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Databases, Genetic; Genome, Human; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; RNA, Neoplasm; RNA, Small Interfering; Transcriptome",3

The extensive genomic alterations obscure the identification of genes driving tumorigenesis during osteosarcoma development. To identify such driver genes, we integrated DNA copy number profiles (Affymetrix SNP 6.0) of 32 diagnostic biopsies with 84 expression profiles (Illumina Human-6 v2.0) of high-grade osteosarcoma as compared with its putative progenitor cells, i.e., mesenchymal stem cells (n = 12) or osteoblasts (n = 3). In addition, we performed paired analyses between copy number and expression profiles of a subset of 29 patients for which both DNA and mRNA profiles were available. Integrative analyses were performed in Nexus Copy Number software and statistical language R. Paired analyses were performed on all probes detecting significantly differentially expressed genes in corresponding LIMMA analyses. For both nonpaired and paired analyses, copy number aberration frequency was set to &gt;35%. Nonpaired and paired integrative analyses resulted in 45 and 101 genes, respectively, which were present in both analyses using different control sets. Paired analyses detected &gt;90% of all genes found with the corresponding nonpaired analyses. Remarkably, approximately twice as many genes as found in the corresponding nonpaired analyses were detected. Affected genes were intersected with differentially expressed genes in osteosarcoma cell lines, resulting in 31 new osteosarcoma driver genes. Cell division related genes, such as MCM4 and LATS2, were overrepresented and genomic instability was predictive for metastasis-free survival, suggesting that deregulation of the cell cycle is a driver of osteosarcomagenesis.",2012,"Biomarkers, Tumor; Biopsy; Bone Neoplasms; Cluster Analysis; Disease Progression; Female; Gene Dosage; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genomic Instability; Humans; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Osteoblasts; Osteosarcoma",3

Most patients with SCLC who initially respond to chemotherapy develop disease relapse. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify novel driver mechanisms of SCLC progression to unlock treatment strategies to improve patient prognosis. SCLC cells comprise subsets of cells possessing progenitor or stem cell properties, while the underlying regulatory pathways remain elusive. Here, we identified the isoform 1 of the neurogenesis-associated protein ASPM (ASPM-I1) as a prominently upregulated stemness-associated gene during the self-renewal of SCLC cells. The expression of ASPM-I1 was found to be upregulated in SCLC cells and tissues, correlated with poor patient prognosis, and indispensable for SCLC stemness and tumorigenesis. A reporter array screening identified multiple developmental signaling pathways, including Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt pathways, whose activity in SCLC cells depended upon ASPM-I1 expression. Mechanistically, ASPM-I1 stabilized the Hh transcriptional factor GLI1 at the protein level through a unique exon-18-encoded region by competing with the E3 ligases &#x3b2;-TrCP and CUL3. In parallel, ASPM-I1 sustains the transcription of the Hh pathway transmembrane regulator SMO through the Wnt-DVL3-&#x3b2;-catenin signaling axis. Functional studies verified that the ASPM-I1-regulated Hh and Wnt activities significantly contributed to SCLC aggressiveness in vivo. Consistently, the expression of ASPM-I1 positively correlated with GLI1 and stemness markers in SCLC tissues. This study illuminates an ASPM-I1-mediated regulatory module that drives tumor stemness and progression in SCLC, providing an exploitable diagnostic and therapeutic target. ASPM promotes SCLC stemness and aggressiveness by stabilizing the expression of GLI1, DVL3, and SMO, representing a novel regulatory hub of Hh and Wnt signaling and targetable vulnerability.",2023,"Humans; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Small Cell Lung Carcinoma; Hedgehog Proteins; Zinc Finger Protein GLI1; Cell Line, Tumor; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Lung Neoplasms; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic",3

Identifying the driver pathways in GC progression is crucial to improving the clinical outcome. Recent studies identified ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated) and FOXM1 (Forkhead box protein M1) as novel Wnt and cancer stem cell (CSC) regulators; their pathogenetic roles and potential crosstalks in GC remain unclarified. The expression patterns of ASPM isoforms and FOXM1 were profiled in normal gastric epithelial and GC tissues. The functional roles of ASPM and FOXM1 in Wnt activity, cancer stemness and GC progression, and the underlying signaling processes were investigated. Approximately one third of GC cells upregulate the expression of ASPM isoform I (ASPMiI) in their cytoplasm; the tumors with a high ASPMiI positive score (&#x2265;&#x2009;10%) are associated with a poor prognosis of the patients. Mechanistically, the molecular interplay among FOXM1, ASPMiI and DVL3 was found to converge on &#x3b2;-catenin to control the Wnt activity and the stemness property of GC cells. This multi-mode Wnt-regulatory module serves to reinforce Wnt signals in CSCs by transcriptional regulation (FOXM1-ASPM), protein-protein interactions (ASPMiI-DVL3-&#x3b2;-catenin), and nuclear translocation (FOXM1-&#x3b2;-catenin).

Drivers of microcephaly could be attractive brain tumor targets.,"New targets for brain tumor therapies may be identified by mutations that cause hereditary microcephaly. Brain growth depends on the repeated proliferation of stem and progenitor cells. Microcephaly syndromes result from mutations that specifically impair the ability of brain progenitor or stem cells to proliferate, by inducing either premature differentiation or apoptosis. Brain tumors that derive from brain progenitor or stem cells may share many of the specific requirements of their cells of origin. These tumors may therefore be susceptible to disruptions of the protein products of genes that are mutated in microcephaly. The potential for the products of microcephaly genes to be therapeutic targets in brain tumors are highlighted hereby reviewing research on EG5, KIF14, ASPM, CDK6, and ATR.

The molecular drivers of age-dependent TC onset and aggressiveness remain poorly understood. We applied an integrative, multi-omics data analysis approach to characterize these signatures. Our analysis reveals that aging, independent of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutational status, drives a significant accumulation of aggressiveness-related markers and poorer survival outcomes, most noticeably at age 55 and over. We identified that chromosomal alterations in loci 1p/1q as aging-associated drivers of aggressiveness, and that depleted infiltration with tumor surveillant CD8+T and follicular helper T cells, dysregulation of proteostasis- and senescence-related processes, and ERK1/2 signaling cascade are key features of the aging thyroid and TC onset/progression and aggressiveness in aging patients but not in young individuals. A panel of 23 genes, including those related to cell division such as CENPF, ERCC6L, and the kinases MELK and NEK2, were identified and rigorously characterized as aging-dependent and aggressiveness-specific markers. These genes effectively stratified patients into aggressive clusters with distinct phenotypic enrichment and genomic/transcriptomic profiles. This panel also showed excellent performance in predicting metastasis stage, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, TERT promoter mutation, and survival outcomes and was superior to the American Thyroid Association (ATA) methodology in predicting aggressiveness risk.

The pioneer factor GATA2 is a significant prostate cancer (PC) driver and is linked to poor prognosis. GATA2 directly promotes androgen receptor (AR) gene expression (both full-length and splice-variant) and facilitates AR binding to chromatin, recruitment of coregulators, and target gene transcription. Unfortunately, there is no clinically applicable GATA2 inhibitor available at the moment. Using a bioinformatics algorithm, we screened in silico 2650 clinically relevant drugs for a potential GATA2 inhibitor. Validation studies used cytotoxicity and proliferation assays, global gene expression analysis, RT-qPCR, reporter assay, reverse phase protein array analysis (RPPA), and immunoblotting. We examined target engagement via cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), ChIP-qPCR, and GATA2 DNA-binding assay. We identified the vasodilator dilazep as a potential GATA2 inhibitor and confirmed on-target activity via CETSA. Dilazep exerted anticancer activity across a broad panel of GATA2-dependent PC cell lines in vitro and in a PDX model in vivo. Dilazep inhibited GATA2 recruitment to chromatin and suppressed the cell-cycle program, transcriptional programs driven by GATA2, AR, and c-MYC, and the expression of several oncogenic drivers, including AR, c-MYC, FOXM1, CENPF, EZH2, UBE2C, and RRM2, as well as of several mediators of metastasis, DNA damage repair, and stemness. In conclusion, we provide, via an extensive compendium of methodologies, proof-of-principle that a small molecule can inhibit GATA2 function and suppress its downstream AR, c-MYC, and other PC-driving effectors.

Cross-species computational analysis of these interactomes has identified FOXM1 and CENPF as synergistic master regulators of prostate cancer malignancy. Experimental validation shows that FOXM1 and CENPF function synergistically to promote tumor growth by coordinated regulation of target gene expression and activation of key signaling pathways associated with prostate cancer malignancy.

Using the Illumina Human NS-12 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip to screen for gene copy number changes in primary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), we initially detected amplification of 35 genes from four genomic regions (1q21-41, 6p21.2-24.1, 7p13 and 8q13-23). By integrated screening of these genes for both DNA copy number and gene expression in HCC and colorectal cancer, we selected CENPF (centromere protein F/mitosin), GMNN (geminin, DNA replication inhibitor), CDK13 (cyclin-dependent kinase 13), and FAM82B (family with sequence similarity 82, member B) as common cancer genes. Each gene exhibited an amplification frequency of ~30% (range, 20-50%) in primary HCC (n = 57) and colorectal cancer (n = 12), as well as in a panel of human cancer cell lines (n = 70). Clonogenic and invasion assays of NIH3T3 cells transfected with each of the four amplified genes showed that CENPF, GMNN, and CDK13 were highly oncogenic whereas FAM82B was not. Interestingly, the oncogenic activity of these genes (excluding FAM82B) was highly correlated with gene-copy numbers in tumor samples (correlation coefficient, r&gt;0.423), indicating that amplifications of CENPF, GMNN, and CDK13 genes are tightly linked and coincident in tumors. Furthermore, we confirmed that CDK13 gene copy number was significantly associated with clinical onset age in patients with HCC (P = 0.0037).

37205848,CHAF1B,10.1182/bloodadvances.2022009438,Repression of TRIM13 by chromatin assembly factor CHAF1B is critical for AML development.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive blood cancer that stems from the rapid expansion of immature leukemic blasts in the bone marrow. Mutations in epigenetic factors represent the largest category of genetic drivers of AML. The chromatin assembly factor CHAF1B is a master epigenetic regulator of transcription associated with self-renewal and the undifferentiated state of AML blasts. Upregulation of CHAF1B, as observed in almost all AML samples, promotes leukemic progression by repressing transcription of differentiation factors and tumor suppressors. However, the specific factors regulated by CHAF1B and their contributions to leukemogenesis are unstudied. We analyzed RNAseq from mouse MLL-AF9 leukemic cells and bone marrow aspirates representing a diverse collection of pediatric AML samples and identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM13 as a target of CHAF1B-mediated transcriptional repression associated with leukemogenesis. We found that CHAF1B binds the promoter of TRIM13, resulting in its transcriptional repression. In turn, TRIM13 suppresses self-renewal of leukemic cells by promoting pernicious entry into the cell cycle through its nuclear localization and catalytic ubiquitination of cell cycle-promoting protein CCNA1. Overexpression of TRIM13 initially prompts a proliferative burst in AML cells that is followed by exhaustion, while loss of total TRIM13 or deletion of its catalytic domain enhanced leukemogenesis in AML cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. These data suggest that CHAF1B promotes leukemic development in part by repressing TRIM13 expression, and that this relationship is necessary for leukemic progression.",2023,NA,1
36897279,NDC80,10.1083/jcb.202205117,PP6 regulation of Aurora A-TPX2 limits NDC80 phosphorylation and mitotic spindle size.,"Amplification of the mitotic kinase Aurora A or loss of its regulator protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) have emerged as drivers of genome instability. Cells lacking PPP6C, the catalytic subunit of PP6, have amplified Aurora A activity, and as we show here, enlarged mitotic spindles which fail to hold chromosomes tightly together in anaphase, causing defective nuclear structure. Using functional genomics to shed light on the processes underpinning these changes, we discover synthetic lethality between PPP6C and the kinetochore protein NDC80. We find that NDC80 is phosphorylated on multiple N-terminal sites during spindle formation by Aurora A-TPX2, exclusively at checkpoint-silenced, microtubule-attached kinetochores. NDC80 phosphorylation persists until spindle disassembly in telophase, is increased in PPP6C knockout cells, and is Aurora B-independent. An Aurora-phosphorylation-deficient NDC80-9A mutant reduces spindle size and suppresses defective nuclear structure in PPP6C knockout cells. In regulating NDC80 phosphorylation by Aurora A-TPX2, PP6 plays an important role in mitotic spindle formation and size control and thus the fidelity of cell division.",2023,Cell Cycle Proteins; Kinetochores; Microtubules; Mitosis; Nuclear Proteins; Phosphoprotein Phosphatases; Phosphorylation; Spindle Apparatus; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Aurora Kinase A; Microtubule-Associated Proteins,3

The gene expression profiles of GSE42656, GSE50161, and GSE86574 were obtained respectively from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with comparison between gene expression profiles of the glioblastoma tissues and normal tissues. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were performed. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and survival curve analysis were also conducted to verify the correlation between expression of hub genes and prognosis. Moreover, in&#xa0;vitro, MTT assay, colony-forming assay, the scratch assay, and flow cytometry were performed to verify the therapeutic effect of JNJ-7706621. AURKA, NDC80, KIF4A, and NUSAP1 were identified as hub genes after PPI network analysis. Differential expression of those genes was detected between human normal glial cells and glioblastoma cells by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (P&#xa0;&lt; 0.05), and the survival curve analysis showed that the patients with low expression of gene AURKA, NDC80, KIF4A, and NUSAP1 had a significant favorable prognosis (P &lt; 0.05). In&#xa0;vitro assays showed that JNJ-7706621 inhibited glioblastoma cellular viability, proliferation, and migration via inducing glioblastoma cells apoptosis. AURKA, NDC80, KIF4A, and NUSAP1 were significantly more highly expressed in glioblastoma cells than in human normal glial cell.

Therefore, we used a loss-of-function screening approach to help identify molecular vulnerabilities that may represent key points of therapeutic intervention. We employed an unbiased high-throughput lethality screen using a 24,088 siRNA library targeting over 6,000 druggable genes and studied their effects on growth and/or survival of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell lines. The top 300 ""hits"" affecting the viability of A1847 cells were rescreened across additional EOC cell lines and non-tumorigenic, human immortalized ovarian epithelial cell lines. Fifty-three gene candidates were found to exhibit effects in all tumorigenic cell lines tested. Extensive validation of these hits refined the list to four high quality candidates (HSPA5, NDC80, NUF2, and PTN). Mechanistic studies show that silencing of three genes leads to increased apoptosis, while HSPA5 silencing appears to alter cell growth through G1 cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, two independent gene expression studies show that NDC80, NUF2 and PTN were significantly aberrantly overexpressed in serous adenocarcinomas. Overall, our functional genomics results integrated with the genomics data provide an important unbiased avenue towards the identification of prospective therapeutic targets for drug discovery, which is an urgent and unmet clinical need for ovarian cancer.",2013,"Apoptosis; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; Carrier Proteins; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytokines; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial; Nuclear Proteins; Ovarian Neoplasms; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction",3

However, MHT therapies were controversial with the increased risk of breast cancer because of different estrogen and progestogen combinations, and the molecular basis behind this phenomenon is currently not understood. To address this issue, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the estrogen plus progestogens treatment (EPT) and estrogen treatment (ET) using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. As a result, a total of 96 upregulated DEGs were first identified. Seven DEGs related to the cell cycle (CCNE2, CDCA5, RAD51, TCF19, KNTC1, MCM10, and NEIL3) were validated by RT-qPCR. Specifically, these seven DEGs were increased in EPT compared to ET (p &lt; 0.05) and had higher expression levels in breast cancer than adjacent normal tissues (p &lt; 0.05). Next, we found that estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients with a higher CNNE2 expression have a shorter overall survival time (p &lt; 0.05), while this effect was not observed in the other six DEGs (p &gt; 0.05). Interestingly, the molecular docking results showed that CCNE2 might bind to 17&#x3b2;-estradiol (&#x2212;6.791 kcal/mol), progesterone (&#x2212;6.847 kcal/mol), and medroxyprogesterone acetate (&#x2212;6.314 kcal/mol) with a relatively strong binding affinity, respectively. Importantly, CNNE2 protein level could be upregulated with EPT and attenuated by estrogen receptor antagonist, acolbifene and had interactions with cancer driver genes (AKT1 and KRAS) and high mutation frequency gene (TP53 and PTEN) in breast cancer patients. In conclusion, the current study showed that CCNE2, CDCA5, RAD51, TCF19, KNTC1, MCM10, and NEIL3 might contribute to EPT-related tumorigenesis in breast cancer, with CCNE2 might be a sensitive risk indicator of breast cancer risk in women using MHT.",2022,"bioinformatic analysis; breast cancer; estrogen plus progestogens treatment; menopausal hormone therapy; Breast Neoplasms; Computational Biology; Estradiol; Estrogen Receptor Antagonists; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Estrogens; Female; Humans; Medroxyprogesterone Acetate; Menopause; Molecular Docking Simulation; Progesterone; Progestins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Receptors, Estrogen; Transcription Factors",2

Here, we investigated the expression of MCMs and their values in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MCMs were analyzed in 105 samples including normal livers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15), cirrhotic livers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40), HCC (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (Cohort 1). Significantly up-regulated MCMs were verified in 102 HCC and matched peritumoral livers using PCR (Cohort 2), and the correlations with clinical features and outcomes were determined. In addition, the focused MCMs were analyzed in parallel immunohistochemistry of 345 samples on spectrum of hepatocarcinogenesis (Cohort 3) and queried for the potential specific role in cell cycle. MCM2-7, MCM8 and MCM10 was significantly up-regulated in HCC in Cohort 1. In Cohort 2, overexpression of MCM2-7, MCM8 and MCM10 was verified and significantly correlated with each other. Elevated MCM2, MCM6 and MCM7 were associated with adverse tumor features and poorer outcomes. In Cohort 3, MCM6 exhibited superior HCC diagnostic performance compared with MCM2 and MCM7 (AUC: 0.896 vs. 0.675 and 0.771, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Additionally, MCM6 other than MCM2 and MCM7 independently predicted poorer survival in 175 HCC patients. Furthermore, knockdown of MCM6 caused a delay in S/G2-phase progression as evidenced by down-regulation of CDK2, CDK4, CyclinA, CyclinB1, CyclinD1, and CyclinE in HCC cells. We analyze MCMs mRNA and protein levels in tissue samples during hepatocarcinogenesis.

To gain more insight into the molecular features of B-ALL in Mexican children, we isolated CD10&#x2009;+&#x2009;/CD19&#x2009;+&#x2009;precursor B lymphoblasts from four bone marrow and nine peripheral blood samples of B-ALL patients using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting protocol. The global gene expression profile (BM vs PB) revealed 136 differentially expressed genes; 62 were upregulated (45.6%) and 74 were downregulated (54.4%). Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to determine the similarity between pre-B lymphoblast populations. We selected 26 highly significant genes and validated 21 by RT-qPCR (CNN3, STON2, CALN1, RUNX2, GADD45A, CDC45, CDC20, PLK1, AIDA, HCK, LY86, GPR65, PIK3CG, LILRB2, IL7R, TCL1A, DOCK1, HIST1H3G, PTPN14, CD72, and NT5E). The gene set enrichment analysis of the total expression matrix and the ingenuity pathway analysis of the 136 differentially expressed genes showed that the cell cycle was altered in the bone marrow with four overexpressed genes (PLK1, CDC20, CDC45, and GADD45A) and a low expression of IL7R and PIK3CG, which are involved in B cell differentiation. A comparative bioinformatics analysis of 15 bone marrow and 10 peripheral blood samples from Hispanic B-ALL patients collected by the TARGET program, corroborated the genes observed, except for PIK3CG. We conclude the Mexican and the Hispanic B-ALL patients studied present common driver alterations and histotype-specific mutations that could facilitate risk stratification and diagnostic accuracy and serve as potential therapeutic targets.",2022,ARACNE; FACS; PIK3CG; Pediatric precursor B-ALL; SMIM10LB2; TARGET,4

Routine methods for detecting TMMs in tumor samples are still missing, whereas telomerase targeting treatments are becoming available. In paediatric cancers, alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is found in a subset of sarcomas and malignant brain tumors. ALT is a non-canonical mechanism of telomere maintenance developed by cancer cells with no-functional telomerase. <i>Methods</i>: To identify drivers and/or markers of ALT, we performed a differential gene expression analysis between two zebrafish models of juvenile brain tumors, that differ only for the telomere maintenance mechanism adopted by tumor cells: one is ALT while the other is telomerase-dependent. <i>Results</i>: Comparative analysis of gene expression identified five genes of the pre-replicative complex, <i>ORC4, ORC6, MCM2</i>, <i>CDC45</i> and <i>RPA3</i> as upregulated in ALT. We searched for a correlation between telomerase levels and expression of the pre-replicative complex genes in a cohort of paediatric brain cancers and identified a counter-correlation between telomerase expression and the genes of the pre-replicative complex. Moreover, the analysis of ALT markers in a group of 20 patients confirmed the association between ALT and increased RPA and decreased H3K9<sub>me3</sub> localization at telomeres. <i>Conclusions</i>: Our study suggests that telomere maintenance mechanisms may act as a driver of telomeric DNA replication and chromatin status in brain cancers and identifies markers of ALT that could be exploited for precise prognostic and therapeutic purposes.",2020,ALT; C-circles; heterochromatin; pediatric brain tumors; pre-replicative complex; telomere maintenance mechanisms; zebrafish,4

Excessive stimulation of CMG helicases by Myc mismanages CMG function by diminishing the number of reserve CMGs necessary for fidelity of DNA replication and recovery from replicative stresses. One potential outcome of these events is the creation of DNA damage that alters genomic structure/function, thereby acting as a driver for tumorigenesis and tumor heterogeneity. Intriguingly, another potential outcome of this Myc-induced CMG helicase over-activation is the creation of a vulnerability in cancer whereby tumor cells specifically lack enough unused reserve CMG helicases to recover from fork-stalling drugs commonly used in chemotherapy. This review provides molecular and clinical support for this provocative hypothesis that excessive activation of CMG helicases by Myc may not only drive tumorigenesis, but also confer an exploitable ""reserve CMG helicase vulnerability"" that supports developing innovative CMG-focused therapeutic approaches for cancer management.",2021,"Cdc45-MCM-GINS helicase; DNA replication; Myc; chemotherapy; tumorigenesis; Animals; Carcinogenesis; Cell Cycle Proteins; Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone; DNA Replication; DNA-Binding Proteins; Humans; Mice; Minichromosome Maintenance Proteins; Neoplasms; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Replication Origin",4
25669969,CDC45,10.18632/oncotarget.3203,MYC is a critical target of FBXW7.,"MYC deregulation is a driver of many human cancers. Altering the balance of MYC protein levels at the level of transcription, protein stability, or turnover is sufficient to transform cells to a tumorigenic phenotype. While direct targeting of MYC is difficult, specific genetic vulnerabilities of MYC-deregulated cells could be exploited to selectively inhibit their growth. Using a genome-wide shRNA screen, we identified 78 candidate genes, which are required for survival of human mammary epithelial cells with elevated MYC levels. Among the candidates, we validated and characterized FBXW7, a component of the SCF-like ubiquitin ligase complex that targets MYC for proteasomal degradation. Down-regulation of FBXW7 leads to synergistic accumulation of cellular and active chromatin-bound MYC, while protein levels of other FBXW7 targets appear unaffected. Over a four-week time course, continuous FBXW7 down-regulation and MYC activation together cause an accumulation of cells in S-phase and G2/M-phase of the cell cycle. Under these conditions, we also observe elevated chromatin-bound levels of CDC45, suggesting increased DNA replication stress. Consistent with these results, FBXW7 down-regulation alone decreases the survival of T47D breast cancer cells. These results establish that FBXW7 down-regulation is synthetic lethal with MYC, and that MYC is a critical target of FBXW7 in breast epithelial cells.",2016,"Breast Neoplasms; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; Epithelial Cells; F-Box Proteins; F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7; Female; G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Mammary Glands, Human; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; RNA Interference; RNA, Messenger; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Signal Transduction; Time Factors; Transfection; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases",4

Platinum-based chemotherapy is a fundamental treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who are not suitable for targeted drug therapies. However, most patients progressed after a period of treatment. Therefore, revealing the genetic information contributing to drug resistance and tumor metastasis in CTCs is valuable for treatment adjustment. In this study, we enrolled nine NSCLC patients with platinum-based chemotherapy resistance. For each patient, 10 CTCs were isolated when progression occurred to perform single cell-level whole-exome sequencing (WES). Meanwhile the patients' paired primary-diagnosed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples and progressive biopsy specimens were also selected to perform WES. Comparisons of distinct mutation profiles between primary and progressive specimens as well as CTCs reflected different evolutionary mechanisms between CTC and lymph node metastasis, embodied in a higher proportion of mutations in CTCs shared with paired progressive lung tumor and hydrothorax specimens (4.4-33.3%) than with progressive lymphatic node samples (0.6-11.8%). Functional annotation showed that CTCs not only harbored cancer-driver gene mutations, including frequent mutations of <i>EGFR</i> and <i>TP53</i> shared with primary and/or progressive tumors, but also particularly harbored cell cycle-regulated or stem cell-related gene mutations, including <i>SHKBP1</i>, <i>NUMA1</i>, <i>ZNF143</i>, <i>MUC16</i>, <i>ORC1</i>, <i>PON1</i>, <i>PELP1</i>, etc., most of which derived from primary tumor samples and played crucial roles in chemo-drug resistance and metastasis for NSCLCs. Thus, detection of genetic information in CTCs is a feasible strategy for studying drug resistance and discovering new drug targets when progressive tumor specimens were unavailable.",2021,circulating tumor cells; drug resistance; non-small cell lung cancer; platinum-based chemotherapy; single cell&#x2013;level WES,1

Metastatic cancer has unique genetic drivers that potentiate tumorigenicity. There is an unmet need for novel targeted therapy in patients with spinal metastatic disease. The authors assessed the effect of verteporfin-induced yes-associated protein (YAP) inhibition on spine metastatic cell tumorigenicity and radiation sensitivity in vitro. Animal studies used a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model to assess the use of systemic intraperitoneal verteporfin (IP-VP) and intratumoral verteporfin microparticles (IT-VP) to inhibit the tumorigenicity of lung and breast spinal metastatic tumors from primary patient-derived tissue. Verteporfin led to a dose-dependent decrease in migration, clonogenicity, and cell viability via inhibition of YAP and downstream effectors cyclin D1, CTGF, TOP2A, ANDRD1, MCL-1, FOSL2, KIF14, and KIF23. This was confirmed with knockdown of YAP. Verteporfin has an additive response when combined with radiation, and knockdown of YAP rendered cells more sensitive to radiation. The addition of verteporfin to YAP knockdown cells did not significantly alter migration, clonogenicity, or cell viability. IP-VP and IT-VP led to diminished tumor growth (p &lt; 0.0001), especially when combined with radiation (p &lt; 0.0001). Tissue analysis revealed diminished expression of YAP (p &lt; 0.0001), MCL-1 (p &lt; 0.0001), and Ki-67 (p &lt; 0.0001) in tissue from verteporfin-treated tumors compared with vehicle-treated tumors. This is the first study to demonstrate that verteporfin-mediated inhibition of YAP leads to diminished tumorigenicity in lung and breast spinal metastatic cancer cells.

The characterization of overexpressed genes could constitute a strategy for identifying drivers of tumor progression as targets for novel therapies. Thus, we performed an integrated gene-expression analysis on RNAseq data of 85 MPM patients from TCGA dataset and reference samples from the GEO. The gene list was further refined by using published studies, a functional enrichment analysis, and the correlation between expression and patients' overall survival. Three molecular signatures defined by 15 genes were detected. Seven genes were involved in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization, with the others in control of the mitotic cell division or apoptosis inhibition. Using Western blot analyses, we found that ADAMTS1, PODXL, CIT, KIF23, MAD2L1, TNNT1, and TRAF2 were overexpressed in a limited number of cell lines. On the other hand, interestingly, CTHRC1, E-selectin, SPARC, UHRF1, PRSS23, BAG2, and MDK were abundantly expressed in over 50% of the six MPM cell lines analyzed. Thus, these proteins are candidates as drivers for sustaining the tumorigenic process.

We aimed to build a prognostic signature by exploring the expression pattern of macrophage phenotypic switch related genes (MRGs) in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)-Pancreas, and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. We identified the differentially expressed genes between the PAAD and normal tissues. We used single factor Cox proportional risk regression analysis, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) analysis, and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis to establish the prognosis risk score by the MRGs. The relationships between the risk score and immune landscape, ""key driver"" mutations and clinicopathological factors were also analyzed. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analysis was also performed. We detected 198 differentially expressed MRGs. The risk score was constructed based on 9 genes (KIF23, BIN1, LAPTM4A, ERAP2, ATP8B2, FAM118A, RGS16, ELMO1, RAPGEFL1). The median overall survival time of patients in the low-risk group was significantly longer than that of patients in the high-risk group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). The prognostic value of the risk score was validated in GSE62452 dataset. The prognostic performance of nomogram based on risk score was superior to that of TNM stage. And GSEA analysis also showed that the risk score was closely related with P53 signaling pathway, pancreatic cancer and T cell receptor signaling pathway. qRT-PCR assay showed that the expressions of the 9 MRGs in PDAC cell lines were higher than those in human pancreatic ductal epithelium cell line.

Loss of cell-cell adhesion and chromosomal instability are cardinal events that drive tumour progression. Here, we show that p120-catenin (p120) not only controls cell-cell adhesion, but also acts as a critical regulator of cytokinesis. We find that p120 regulates actomyosin contractility through concomitant binding to RhoA and the centralspindlin component MKLP1, independent of cadherin association. In anaphase, p120 is enriched at the cleavage furrow where it binds MKLP1 to spatially control RhoA GTPase cycling. Binding of p120 to MKLP1 during cytokinesis depends on the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of p120 isoform 1A. Importantly, clinical data show that loss of p120 expression is a common event in breast cancer that strongly correlates with multinucleation and adverse patient survival. In summary, our study identifies p120 loss as a driver event of chromosomal instability in cancer.",2018,"Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Catenins; Cell Adhesion; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytokinesis; Female; HeLa Cells; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Mice, Knockout; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Protein Binding; rhoA GTP-Binding Protein; Delta Catenin",5

Aiming to add genetic information potentially useful for novel targets discovery, we performed an extensive genomic characterization by whole-exome sequencing and SNP array profiling of six cutaneous melanoma cell lines derived from metastatic patients. We obtained a total of 3,325 novel coding single nucleotide variants, including 2,172 non-synonymous variants. We catalogued the coding mutations according to Sanger COSMIC database and to a manually curated list including genes involved in melanoma pathways identified by mining recent literature. Besides confirming the presence of known melanoma driver mutations (BRAF(V600E), NRAS(Q61R) ), we identified novel mutated genes involved in signalling pathways crucial for melanoma pathogenesis and already addressed by current targeted therapies (such as MAPK and glutamate pathways).

Herein, the GSE102484 dataset containing expression profiling data from 683 BRCA patients was re-analyzed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The yellow module with the highest correlation to BRCA progression was screened out, followed by functional enrichment analysis and establishment of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. After further validation through survival analysis and expression evaluation, CHEK1 and UBE2C were finally identified as hub genes related to the progression of BRCA, especially the luminal A breast cancer subtype. Notably, both hub genes were found to be dysregulated in multiple types of immune cells and closely correlated with tumor infiltration, as revealed by Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) along with other bioinformatic tools. Construction of transcription factors (TF)-hub gene network further confirmed the existence of 11 TFs which could regulate both hub genes simultaneously. Our present study may facilitate the invention of targeted therapeutic drugs and provide novel insights into the understanding of the mechanism beneath the progression of BRCA.",2022,CHEK1; UBE2C; WGCNA; breast cancer; timer,6

To identify potential targeted therapies for CALR mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms, we searched for small molecules that selectively inhibit the growth of CALR mutated cells using high-throughput drug screening. We investigated 89 172 compounds using isogenic cell lines carrying CALR mutations and identified synthetic lethality with compounds targeting the ATR-CHK1 pathway. The selective inhibitory effect of these compounds was validated in a co-culture assay of CALR mutated and wild-type cells. Of the tested compounds, CHK1 inhibitors potently depleted CALR mutated cells, allowing wild-type cell dominance in the co-culture over time. Neither CALR deficient cells nor JAK2V617F mutated cells showed hypersensitivity to ATR-CHK1 inhibition, thus suggesting specificity for the oncogenic activation by the mutant CALR. CHK1 inhibitors induced replication stress in CALR mutated cells revealed by elevated pan-nuclear staining for &#x3b3;H2AX and hyperphosphorylation of RPA2. This was accompanied by S-phase cell cycle arrest due to incomplete DNA replication. Transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic analyses revealed a replication stress signature caused by oncogenic CALR, suggesting an intrinsic vulnerability to CHK1 perturbation. This study reveals the ATR-CHK1 pathway as a potential therapeutic target in CALR mutated hematopoietic cells.",2022,"Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins; Calreticulin; Cell Line; Checkpoint Kinase 1; Drug Discovery; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Humans; Mutation; Primary Myelofibrosis; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Signal Transduction; Thrombocythemia, Essential",6

CDK2 activity increases as cells progress through S phase, and its cyclin partner switches from cyclin E to cyclin A. Activation of CDK2 requires dephosphorylation of tyrosine-15 by CDC25A. DNA damage activates the checkpoint protein CHK1, which phosphorylates and degrades CDC25A to prevent activation of CDK2 and protect from cell cycle progression before damage is repaired. CHK1 inhibitors were developed to circumvent this arrest and enhance the efficacy of many cancer chemotherapeutic agents. CHK1 inhibition results in the accumulation of CDC25A and activation of CDK2. We demonstrate that inhibition of CDK2 or suppression of cyclin A also results in accumulation of CDC25A suggesting a feedback loop that prevents over activation of this pathway. The feedback inhibition of CDC25A targets phosphorylation of S88-CDC25A, which resides within a CDK consensus sequence. In contrast, it appears that CDK complexes with cyclin B (and possibly cyclin E) stabilize CDC25A in a feed-forward activation loop. While CDK2/cyclin A would normally be active at late S/G2, we propose that this feedback inhibitory loop prevents over activation of CDK2 in early S phase, while still leaving CDK2/cyclin E to catalyze replicon initiation. One importance of this observation is that a subset of cancer cell lines are very sensitive to CHK1 inhibition, which is mediated by CDK2/cyclin A activity in S phase cells. Hence, dysregulation of this feedback loop might facilitate sensitivity of the cells.",2022,"CDC25A; CDK2; CHK1; WEE1; cell cycle regulation; cyclin A; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Checkpoint Kinase 1; Cyclin A; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2; Enzyme Activation; Enzyme Stability; Feedback, Physiological; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Neoplasms; Phosphorylation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proteolysis; Signal Transduction; Ubiquitination; cdc25 Phosphatases",6

In particular, APOBEC3A (A3A) has emerged as a major driver of mutagenesis in cancer cells, and its expression results in DNA damage and susceptibility to treatment with inhibitors of the ATR and CHK1 checkpoint kinases. Here, we report the implementation of CRISPR/Cas-9 genetic screening to identify susceptibilities of multiple A3A-expressing lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines. We identify HMCES, a protein recently linked to the protection of abasic sites, as a central protein for the tolerance of A3A expression. HMCES depletion results in synthetic lethality with A3A expression preferentially in a TP53-mutant background. Analysis of previous screening data reveals a strong association between A3A mutational signatures and sensitivity to HMCES loss and indicates that HMCES is specialized in protecting against a narrow spectrum of DNA damaging agents in addition to A3A. We experimentally show that both HMCES disruption and A3A expression increase susceptibility of cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR), oxidative stress, and ATR inhibition, strategies that are often applied in tumor therapies. Overall, our results suggest that HMCES is an attractive target for selective treatment of A3A-expressing tumors.",2021,"Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Checkpoint Kinase 1; Cytidine Deaminase; Cytosine Deaminase; DNA; DNA Damage; DNA Replication; DNA-Binding Proteins; Humans; Proteins",6

Nevertheless, treatments targeting E:C fusion has not been well established yet. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate potential therapies targeting E:C fusion based on systematic bioinformatical analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. One thousand related genes were extracted using transcriptome analysis, and major signaling pathways associated with breast cancer were identified with over-representation analysis. Then, we conducted drug-target network analysis based on the OncoKB and CIViC databases, and finally selected potentially applicable drug candidates. Six major cancer-related signaling pathways (p53, ATR/ATM, FOXM1, hedgehog, cell cycle, and Aurora B) were significantly altered in E:C fusion-positive cases of breast cancer. Further investigation revealed that nine genes (<i>AURKB</i>, <i>HDAC2</i>, <i>PLK1</i>, <i>CENPA</i>, <i>CHEK1</i>, <i>CHEK2</i>, <i>RB1</i>, <i>CCNA2</i>, and <i>MDM2</i>) in coordination with E:C fusion were found to be common denominators in three or more of these pathways, thereby making them promising gene biomarkers for target therapy. Among the 21 putative actionable drugs inferred by drug-target network analysis, palbociclib, alpelisib, ribociclib, dexamethasone, checkpoint kinase inhibitor AXD 7762, irinotecan, milademetan tosylate, R05045337, cisplatin, prexasertib, and olaparib were considered promising drug candidates targeting genes involved in at least two E:C fusion-related pathways.",2021,CCDC170; ESR1; TCGA; bioinformatics; breast cancer; drug repositioning; gene fusion,6

The lack of driver oncogenes complicates the development of targeted treatments for HNSCC. Here, we follow-up on two previous genome-wide RNA and microRNA interference screens in HNSCC to cross-examine tumor-specific lethality by targeting ATM, ATR, CHEK1, or CHEK2. Our results uncover CHEK1 as the most promising target for HNSCC. CHEK1 expression is essential across a panel of HNSCC cell lines but redundant for growth and survival of untransformed oral keratinocytes and fibroblasts. LY2603618 (Rabusertib), which specifically targets Chk1 kinase, kills HNSCC cells effectively and specifically. Our findings show that HNSCC cells depend on Chk1-mediated signaling to progress through S-phase successfully. Chk1 inhibition coincides with stalled DNA replication, replication fork collapses, and accumulation of DNA damage. We further show that Chk1 inhibition leads to bimodal HNSCC cell killing. In the most sensitive cell lines, apoptosis is induced in S-phase, whereas more resistant cell lines manage to bypass replication-associated apoptosis, but accumulate chromosomal breaks that become lethal in subsequent mitosis. Interestingly, CDK1 expression correlates with treatment outcome. Moreover, sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition requires functional CDK1 and CDK4/6 to drive cell cycle progression, arguing against combining Chk1 inhibitors with CDK inhibitors. In contrast, Wee1 inhibitor Adavosertib progresses the cell cycle and thereby increases lethality to Chk1 inhibition in HNSCC cell lines. We conclude that Chk1 has become a key molecule in HNSCC cell cycle regulation and a very promising therapeutic target. Chk1 inhibition leads to S-phase apoptosis or death in mitosis. We provide a potential efficacy biomarker and combination therapy to follow-up in clinical setting.",2021,NA,6

CBX2 expression is elevated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), for which there are few therapeutic options. Here, we aimed to investigate the functional role of CBX2 in TNBC. CBX2 knockdown in TNBC models reduced cell numbers, which was rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type CBX2 but not a chromatin binding-deficient mutant. Blocking CBX2 chromatin interactions using the inhibitor SW2_152F also reduced cell growth, suggesting CBX2 chromatin binding is crucial for TNBC progression. RNA sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis of CBX2-depleted cells identified downregulation of oncogenic signalling pathways, including mTORC1 and E2F signalling. Subsequent analysis identified that CBX2 represses the expression of mTORC1 inhibitors and the tumour suppressor RBL2. RBL2 repression, in turn, inhibits DREAM complex activity. The DREAM complex inhibits E2F signalling, causing cell senescence; therefore, inhibition of the DREAM complex via CBX2 may be a key oncogenic driver. We observed similar effects in oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, and analysis of patient datasets suggested CBX2 inhibits RBL2 activity in other cancer types. Therapeutic inhibition of CBX2 could therefore repress mTORC1 activation and promote DREAM complex-mediated senescence in TNBC and could have similar effects in other cancer types.",2022,CBX2; PRC1; RBL2; TNBC; breast cancer; epigenetics; mTORC1; polycomb,12
35445033,PRC1,10.3389/fcell.2022.864051,PRC1 and RACGAP1 are Diagnostic Biomarkers of Early HCC and PRC1 Drives Self-Renewal of Liver Cancer Stem Cells.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths across the world. Due to the lack of reliable markers for early HCC detection, most HCC patients are diagnosed in middle/late stages. Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are drivers of liver tumorigenesis, usually emerge in the early HCC stage and are also termed as liver tumor initiation cells (TIC). Liver CSCs contribute to initiation, propagation, and metastasis of HCC and also play a key role in tumor therapy. Taking advantage of online-available data sets, bioinformatic analyses, and experimental confirmation, here we have screened out PRC1 and RACGAP1 as reliable markers for early HCC detection. PRC1 or RACGAP1 knockdown dramatically inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion capacities of HCC cells, conferring PRC1 and RACGAP1 as predominant modulators for HCC propagation and metastasis. Moreover, the sphere formation capacity of HCC cells was impaired after PRC1 knockdown, revealing the function of PRC1 as a modulator for liver CSC self-renewal. Furthermore, the inhibitor of PRC1 had same phenotypes as PRC1 knockdown in HCC cells. Altogether, PRC1 and RACGAP1 are identified both as prognosis markers for early HCC detection and therapeutic targets for liver cancer and liver CSCs, adding additional layers for the early prognosis and therapy of HCC.",2022,biomarker; cancer stem cell; liver cancer; metastasis; self-renewal,12

Through EMT, tumors can develop a mesenchymal phenotype similar to cancer stem cell traits that contributes to metastasis and variation in therapeutic responses. Some of the recurrent somatic mutations of prostate cancer affect EMT driver genes and effector transcription factors that induce the chromatin- and androgen-dependent epigenetic alterations that characterize castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). EMT regulators in prostate cancer comprise transcription factors (<i>SNAI1/2</i>, <i>ZEB1</i>, <i>TWIST1</i>, and ETS), tumor suppressor genes (<i>RB1</i>, <i>PTEN</i>, and <i>TP53</i>), and post-transcriptional regulators (miRNAs) that under the selective pressures of antiandrogen therapy can develop an androgen-independent metastatic phenotype. In prostate cancer mouse models of EMT, Slug expression, as well as WNT/&#x3b2;-Catenin and notch signaling pathways, have been shown to increase stemness potential. Recent single-cell transcriptomic studies also suggest that the stemness phenotype of advanced prostate cancer may be related to EMT. Other evidence correlates EMT and stemness with immune evasion, for example, activation of the polycomb repressor complex I, promoting EMT and stemness and cytokine secretion through <i>RB1</i>, <i>TP53</i>, and <i>PRC1</i>. These findings are helping clinical trials in CRPC that seek to understand how drugs and biomarkers related to the acquisition of EMT can improve drug response.",2022,"castrate-resistant prostate cancer; chromatin modification; epigenomics; immune evasion; immunotherapy; mouse models of cancer; oncogenes; plasticity; tumor microenvironment; tumor suppressor genes; Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Humans; Male; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Precision Medicine; Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant; Signal Transduction",12

One-third are significantly more prevalent in mCRPC than expected while a quarter are less prevalent. Mutations in AR and its enhancer are more prevalent in mCRPC, as are those in TP53, MYC, ZNRF3 and PRKDC. ZNRF3 loss is associated with decreased ZNRF3 mRNA abundance, WNT, cell cycle &amp; PRC1/2 activity, and genomic instability. ZNRF3 loss, RNA downregulation and hypermethylation are prognostic of metastasis and overall survival, independent of clinical and pathologic indices. These data demonstrate a strategy for identifying biomarkers of localized cancer aggression, with ZNRF3 loss as a predictor of metastasis in prostate cancer.",2021,"Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; Mutation; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Prevalence; Prognosis; Prostatic Neoplasms; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases",12

However, the precise mechanisms by which H3-K27M causes tumor initiation remain unclear. Here, we use human hindbrain neural stem cells to model the consequences of H3.3-K27M on the epigenomic landscape in a relevant developmental context. Genome-wide mapping of epitope-tagged histone H3.3 revealed that both the wild type and the K27M mutant incorporate abundantly at pre-existing active enhancers and promoters, and to a lesser extent at Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-bound regions. At active enhancers, H3.3-K27M leads to focal H3K27ac loss, decreased chromatin accessibility and reduced transcriptional expression of nearby neurodevelopmental genes. In addition, H3.3-K27M deposition at a subset of PRC2 target genes leads to increased PRC2 and PRC1 binding and augmented transcriptional repression that can be partially reversed by PRC2 inhibitors. Our work suggests that, rather than imposing de novo transcriptional circuits, H3.3-K27M drives tumorigenesis by locking initiating cells in their pre-existing, immature epigenomic state, via disruption of PRC2 and enhancer functions.",2021,"Animals; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein; Epigenome; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Glioma; Histones; Humans; Lysine; Male; Mice, Inbred Strains; Mutation; Neural Stem Cells; Oncogenes; Polycomb Repressive Complex 2; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Rhombencephalon",12

Here, we identified delayed down-regulated genes (DDGs) in mammary cells after prolonged treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF). The expression of these DDGs was low in mammary tumors and correlated with prognosis. The proteins encoded by several DDGs directly bind to and inactivate oncoproteins and might therefore act as tumor suppressors. The transcription factor teashirt zinc finger homeobox 2 (TSHZ2) is encoded by a DDG, and we found that overexpression of TSHZ2 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis and accelerated mammary gland development in mice. Although the gene <i>TSHZ2</i> localizes to a locus (20q13.2) that is frequently amplified in breast cancer, we found that hypermethylation of its promoter correlated with down-regulation of <i>TSHZ2</i> expression in patients. Yeast two-hybrid screens and protein-fragment complementation assays in mammalian cells indicated that TSHZ2 nucleated a multiprotein complex containing PRC1/Ase1, cyclin B1, and additional proteins that regulate cytokinesis. TSHZ2 increased the inhibitory phosphorylation of PRC1, a key driver of mitosis, mediated by cyclin-dependent kinases. Furthermore, similar to the tumor suppressive transcription factor p53, TSHZ2 inhibited transcription from the <i>PRC1</i> promoter. By recognizing DDGs as a distinct group in the transcriptional response to EGF, our findings uncover a group of tumor suppressors and reveal a role for TSHZ2 in cell cycle regulation.",2022,"Animals; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cytokinesis; Epidermal Growth Factor; Female; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Mice",12

Cancer-specific fusion oncoproteins, which display unique chromatin localization patterns, often lack classical DNA-binding domains, presenting challenges in identifying mechanisms governing their site-specific chromatin targeting and function. Here we identify a minimal region of the human SS18-SSX fusion oncoprotein (the hallmark driver of synovial sarcoma) that mediates a direct interaction between the mSWI/SNF complex and the nucleosome acidic patch. This binding results in altered mSWI/SNF composition and nucleosome engagement, driving cancer-specific mSWI/SNF complex targeting and gene expression. Furthermore, the C-terminal region of SSX confers preferential affinity to repressed, H2AK119Ub-marked nucleosomes, underlying the selective targeting to polycomb-marked genomic regions and synovial sarcoma-specific dependency on PRC1 function.

Histones, the fundamental substrates for chromatin-modifying and remodelling enzymes, are mutated in tumours including gliomas, sarcomas, head and neck cancers, and carcinosarcomas. Classical 'oncohistone' mutations occur in the N-terminal tail of histone H3 and affect the function of polycomb repressor complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). However, the prevalence and function of histone mutations in other tumour contexts is unknown. Here we show that somatic histone mutations occur in approximately 4% (at a conservative estimate) of diverse tumour types and in crucial regions of histone proteins. Mutations occur in all four core histones, in both the N-terminal tails and globular histone fold domains, and at or near residues that contain important post-translational modifications. Many globular domain mutations are homologous to yeast mutants that abrogate the need for SWI/SNF function, occur in the key regulatory 'acidic patch' of histones H2A and H2B, or are predicted to disrupt the H2B-H4 interface.

The X-linked BCOR gene (BCL-6 Corepressor) is a member of the PRC1 complex and potentiates transcriptional repression through BCL6 binding of PRC1. Accumulating evidence suggests that internal tandem duplications (ITD) of BCOR are oncogenic drivers in a subset of pediatric sarcomas and rare adult tumors. We reviewed the genomic profiles of a large series of advanced cancer patients to determine the frequency and genomic spectrum of ITD of BCOR across cancer. Tissues from 140,411 unique advanced cancers were sequenced by hybrid-capture-NGS-based comprehensive genomic profiling of 186-315 genes plus introns from 14 to 28 genes commonly rearranged in cancer, as well as RNA for 265 genes for a portion of these cases. BCOR-ITDs were present in 0.024% of all cases (33/140,411). Of this dataset, sarcoma cancer types were most frequent, 63.6% (21/33), either of uterine origin 52.4% (11/21), or pediatric (nonuterine) 42.8% (9/21). The identified BCOR-ITDs occurred most frequently in exon 15, near C-terminus, 69.7% (23/33), with a mean insertion length of 31.7 codons (range 30-38). Of uterine cases, an expert gynecologic pathology central review identified all these cases as having a similar high-grade morphology consistent with endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS), and 90% of cases having a round cell component. Of the uterine sarcoma cases harboring exon 15 BCOR-ITDs, none simultaneously carried gene fusions typically associated with ESS. BCOR-ITDs define a rare subset of pediatric sarcomas and clinically aggressive endometrial stromal sarcoma cases, as defined by NGS for the first time.

Downstream of the oncogenic trigger are alterations in protein properties that give rise to cellular transformation and the acquisition of malignant cellular phenotypes. Developments in mass spectrometry enable large-scale, multidimensional characterisation of proteomes. Such techniques could provide an unprecedented, unbiased view of how oncogene activation remodels a human cell proteome. <b>Methods</b>: Using quantitative MS-based proteomics and cellular assays, we analysed how transformation induced by activating v-Src kinase remodels the proteome and cellular phenotypes of breast epithelial (MCF10A) cells. SILAC MS was used to comprehensively characterise the MCF10A proteome and to measure v-Src-induced changes in protein abundance across seven time-points (1-72 hrs). We used pulse-SILAC MS ( Boisvert <i>et al</i>., 2012), to compare protein synthesis and turnover in control and transformed cells. Follow-on experiments employed a combination of cellular and functional assays to characterise the roles of selected Src-responsive proteins. <b>Results</b>: Src-induced transformation changed the expression and/or turnover levels of ~3% of proteins, affecting ~1.5% of the total protein molecules in the cell. Transformation increased the average rate of proteome turnover and disrupted protein homeostasis. We identify distinct classes of protein kinetics in response to Src activation. We demonstrate that members of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) are important regulators of invasion and migration in MCF10A cells. Many Src-regulated proteins are present in low abundance and some are regulated post-transcriptionally. The signature of Src-responsive proteins is highly predictive of poor patient survival across multiple cancer types. Open access to search and interactively explore all these proteomic data is provided via the EPD database ( www.peptracker.com/epd). <b>Conclusions</b>: We present the first comprehensive analysis measuring how protein expression and protein turnover is affected by cell transformation, providing a detailed picture at the protein level of the consequences of activation of an oncogene.",2021,Biomarker; Cancer; Epigenetic; Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC); Protein half-life; Serine protease inhibitor (Serpin); Src Kinase; Time-lapse Proteomics,12

The relevance of MK3 for oncogenesis is currently not clear. We recently reported that MK3 controls ERK activity via a negative feedback mechanism. This prompted us to investigate a potential role for MK3 in cell proliferation. We here show that overexpression of MK3 induces a proliferative arrest in normal diploid human fibroblasts, characterized by enhanced expression of replication stress- and senescence-associated markers. Surprisingly, MK3 depletion evokes similar senescence characteristics in the fibroblast model. We previously identified MK3 as a binding partner of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) proteins. In the current study we show that MK3 overexpression results in reduced cellular EZH2 levels and concomitant loss of epigenetic H3K27me3-marking and PRC1/chromatin-occupation at the CDKN2A/INK4A locus. In agreement with this, the PRC1 oncoprotein BMI1, but not the PCR2 protein EZH2, bypasses MK3-induced senescence in fibroblasts and suppresses P16INK4A expression. In contrast, BMI1 does not rescue the MK3 loss-of-function phenotype, suggesting the involvement of multiple different checkpoints in gain and loss of MK3 function. Notably, MK3 ablation enhances proliferation in two different cancer cells. Finally, the fibroblast model was used to evaluate the effect of potential tumorigenic MK3 driver-mutations on cell proliferation and M/SAPK signaling imbalance. Taken together, our findings support a role for MK3 in control of proliferation and replicative life-span, in part through concerted action with BMI1, and suggest that the effect of MK3 modulation or mutation on M/SAPK signaling and, ultimately, proliferation, is cell context-dependent.",2015,"Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cellular Senescence; Fibroblasts; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7; Mutation; Polycomb-Group Proteins; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases",12

Despite recent advances in understanding the complexity of NB, the mechanisms that determine its regression or progression are still largely unknown. Stage 4S NB is characterized by a favorable course of disease and often by spontaneous regression, while progression to true stage 4 is a very rare event. Here, we focused on genomic analysis of an NB case that progressed from stage 4S to stage 4 with a very poor outcome. Array-comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) on tumor-tissue DNA, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) on exosomes DNA derived from plasma collected at the onset and at the tumor progression, pointed out relevant genetic changes that can explain this clinical worsening. The combination of a-CGH and WES data allowed for the identification iof somatic copy number aberrations and single-nucleotide variants in genes known to be responsible for aggressive NB. <i>KLRB1</i>, <i>MAPK3</i> and <i>FANCA</i> genes, which were lost at the time of progression, were studied for their possible role in this event by analyzing in silico the impact of their expression on the outcome of 786 NB patients.",2022,Neuroblastoma; array-comparative genomic hybridization; single-nucleotide variants; somatic copy number alterations; stage 4S; tumor progression; whole-exome sequencing; Comparative Genomic Hybridization; Genomics; Humans; Neuroblastoma; Exome Sequencing,4

Compelling evidence suggests important pathological roles for TREM1 in various types of solid tumors. However, the role of TREM1 in hematologic malignancies is not known. Our previous study demonstrated that TREM1 cooperates with diminished DNA damage response to induce expansion of pre-leukemic hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in mice deficient for the Fanconi anemia gene Fanca. Here we investigated TREM1 in leukemogenesis using mouse models of the DNA repair-deficient Fanca-/- and the oncogenic MLL-AF9 or KrasG12D. We found that Trem1 was highly expressed in preleukemic HSC and leukemia stem cells (LSC). By selective deletion of the Trem1 gene in the hematopoietic compartment, we showed that ablation of Trem1 reduced leukemogenic activity of the pre-leukemic HSC and LSC in mice. Trem1 was required for the proliferation of the pre-leukemic HSC and LSC. Further analysis revealed that Trem1 expression in preleukemic HSC and LSC was associated with persistent DNA damage, prolonged oncogenic stress, and a strong inflammatory signature. Targeting several top Trem1 inflammatory signatures inhibited the proliferation of pre-leukemic HSC and LSC. Collectively, our observations uncover previously unknown expression and function of TREM1 in malignant stem cells, and identify TREM1 as a driver of leukemogenesis.",2022,"Mice; Animals; Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells-1; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; DNA Damage; Fanconi Anemia; Carcinogenesis",4

We describe a whole-exome sequencing (WES) precision medicine trial focused on patients with advanced cancer. To understand how WES data affect therapeutic decision making in patients with advanced cancer and to identify novel biomarkers of response. Patients with metastatic and treatment-resistant cancer were prospectively enrolled at a single academic center for paired metastatic tumor and normal tissue WES during a 19-month period (February 2013 through September 2014). A comprehensive computational pipeline was used to detect point mutations, indels, and copy number alterations. Mutations were categorized as category 1, 2, or 3 on the basis of actionability; clinical reports were generated and discussed in precision tumor board. Patients were observed for 7 to 25 months for correlation of molecular information with clinical response. Feasibility, use of WES for decision making, and identification of novel biomarkers. A total of 154 tumor-normal pairs from 97 patients with a range of metastatic cancers were sequenced, with a mean coverage of 95X and 16 somatic alterations detected per patient. In total, 16 mutations were category 1 (targeted therapy available), 98 were category 2 (biologically relevant), and 1474 were category 3 (unknown significance). Overall, WES provided informative results in 91 cases (94%), including alterations for which there is an approved drug, there are therapies in clinical or preclinical development, or they are considered drivers and potentially actionable (category 1-2); however, treatment was guided in only 5 patients (5%) on the basis of these recommendations because of access to clinical trials and/or off-label use of drugs. Among unexpected findings, a patient with prostate cancer with exceptional response to treatment was identified who harbored a somatic hemizygous deletion of the DNA repair gene FANCA and putative partial loss of function of the second allele through germline missense variant. Follow-up experiments established that loss of FANCA function was associated with platinum hypersensitivity both in vitro and in patient-derived xenografts, thus providing biologic rationale and functional evidence for his extreme clinical response. The majority of advanced, treatment-resistant tumors across tumor types harbor biologically informative alterations. The establishment of a clinical trial for WES of metastatic tumors with prospective follow-up of patients can help identify candidate predictive biomarkers of response.",2016,"Academic Medical Centers; Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; Computational Biology; DNA Copy Number Variations; DNA Mutational Analysis; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Exome; Feasibility Studies; Female; Gene Dosage; Genetic Testing; Humans; INDEL Mutation; Male; Mice; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Mutation; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasms; Patient Selection; Precision Medicine; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",4

Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) has a known mutation signature and has proven capable of inducing changes to DNA sequence that drives normal pre-stasis human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) past a first tumor suppressor barrier (stasis) and toward immortality. We analyzed normal, pre-stasis HMEC, three independent BaP-derived post-stasis HMEC strains (184Aa, 184Be, 184Ce) and two of their immortal derivatives(184A1 and 184BE1) by whole exome sequencing. The independent post-stasis strains exhibited between 93 and 233 BaP-induced mutations in exons. Seventy percent of the mutations were C:G&gt;A:T transversions, consistent with the known mutation spectrum of BaP. Mutations predicted to impact protein function occurred in several known and putative cancer drivers including p16, PLCG1, MED12, TAF1 in 184Aa; PIK3CG, HSP90AB1, WHSC1L1, LCP1 in 184Be and FANCA, LPP in 184Ce. Biological processes that typically harbor cancer driver mutations such as cell cycle, regulation of cell death and proliferation, RNA processing, chromatin modification and DNA repair were found to have mutations predicted to impact function in each of the post-stasis strains. Spontaneously immortalized HMEC lines derived from two of the BaP-derived post-stasis strains shared greater than 95% of their BaP-induced mutations with their precursor cells. These immortal HMEC had 10 or fewer additional point mutations relative to their post-stasis precursors, but acquired chromosomal anomalies during immortalization that arose independent of BaP. The results of this study indicate that acute exposures of HMEC to high dose BaP recapitulate mutation patterns of human tumors and can induce mutations in a number of cancer driver genes.",2015,"Benzo[a]pyrene; Carcinogenesis; HMEC; p16; Benzo(a)pyrene; Carcinogens, Environmental; Cells, Cultured; Chromosome Aberrations; Epithelial Cells; Exome; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Neoplasm; Humans; Mammary Glands, Human; Mutation; Neoplasms; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Young Adult",4

However, our understanding of the drivers that influence cancer aggression is limited. In this work, we study somatic mutation data consists of 450 metastatic breast tumor samples from cBio Cancer Genomics Portal. We use four software tools to extract features from this data. Then, an ensemble classifier (EC) learning algorithm called EARN (Ensemble of Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, and non-linear Support Vector Machine) is proposed to evaluate plausible driver genes for metastatic breast cancer (MBCA). The decision-making strategy for the proposed ensemble machine is based on the aggregation of the predicted scores obtained from individual learning classifiers to be prioritized homo sapiens genes annotated as protein-coding from NCBI. This study is an attempt to focus on the findings in several aspects of MBCA prognosis and diagnosis. First, drivers and passengers predicted by SVM, ANN, RF, and EARN are introduced. Second, biological inferences of predictions are discussed based on gene set enrichment analysis. Third, statistical validation and comparison of all learning methods are performed by some evaluation metrics. Finally, the pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) using ReactomeFIVIz tool (FDR&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.03) for the top 100 genes predicted by EARN leads us to propose a new gene set panel for MBCA. It includes HDAC3, ABAT, GRIN1, PLCB1, and KPNA2 as well as NCOR1, TBL1XR1, SIRT4, KRAS, CACNA1E, PRKCG, GPS2, SIN3A, ACTB, KDM6B, and PRMT1. Furthermore, we compare results for MBCA to other outputs regarding 983 primary tumor samples of breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The comparison between outputs shows that ROC-AUC reaches 99.24% using EARN for MBCA and 99.79% for BRCA. This statistical result is better than three individual classifiers in each case. This research using an integrative approach assists precision oncologists to design compact targeted panels that eliminate the need for whole-genome/exome sequencing.

The multistep process of liver carcinogenesis involves various genetic and phenotypic alterations. The molecular pathways and driver mutations involved are still under investigation. DNA micorarray technology was used to identify differentially expressed genes between human hepatocarcinoma and non-tumorous liver tissues to establish a unique specific gene-expression profile independent of the underlying liver disease. The validity of this global gene-expression profile was tested for its robustness against biopsies from other liver entities (cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic liver) by diagnosing HCC in blinded samples. Most of the consistently and strongly overexpressed genes were related to cell-cycle regulation and DNA replication [27 genes, e.g. cyclin B1, karyopherin alpha 2 (KPNA2), cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDC2)], G-protein depending signaling [e.g. Rac GTPase activating protein 1 (RACGAP1), Rab GTPase YPT1 homolog (RAB1), and ADP-ribosylation factor-like 2 (ARL2)] and extracellular matrix re-modelling or cytoskeleton structure [22 genes, e.g. serine proteinase inhibitor 1 kazal-type (SPINK1), osteopontin (OPN), secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), collagen type 1 alpha2 (COL1A2), integrin alpha6 (ITGA6), and metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12)]. Furthermore, significantly differentially expressed genes (e.g. calcium-binding proteins, G-proteins, oncofetal proteins) in relation to tumor differentiation were detected using gene-expression analysis. It is suggested that these significantly dysregulated genes are highly specific and potentially utilizable as prognostic markers and may lead to a better understanding of human hepatocarcinogenesis.",2017,"Hepatocellular carcinoma; SPINK1; affymetrix; gene expression analysis; glypican 3; hepatocarcinogenesis; oligonucleotide arrays; Aged; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged",2

Although teratoma is usually curable, in rare cases it can give rise to various somatic tumors and exceptionally it undergoes melanocytic neuroectodermal tumor (MNT) transformation, a process that is not well-described. We report a patient with a postchemotherapy thymic teratoma associated with an MNT component who, 10 years later, additionally presented a vertebral metastasis corresponding to an anaplastic MNT. Using exome sequencing of the mature teratoma, the MNT and its metastatic vertebral anaplastic MNT components, we identified 19 somatic mutations shared by at least two components. Six mutations were common to all three components, and three of them were located in the known cancer-related genes <i>KRAS</i> (p.E63K), <i>TP53</i> (p.P222X), and <i>POLQ</i> (p.S447P). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the melanoma tumorigenesis pathway was enriched in mutated genes including the four major driver genes <i>KRAS</i>, <i>TP53</i>, <i>ERBB4</i>, and <i>KDR</i>, indicating that these genes may be involved in the development of the anaplastic MNT transformation of the teratoma. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular study realized on MNT.

We showed here that formaldehyde generated by serine/1-carbon cycle metabolism contributed to the accumulation of toxic DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) in leukemia cells, especially in driver clones harboring oncogenic tyrosine kinases (OTKs: FLT3(internal tandem duplication [ITD]), JAK2(V617F), BCR-ABL1). To counteract this effect, OTKs enhanced the expression of DNA polymerase theta (POL&#x3b8;) via ERK1/2 serine/threonine kinase-dependent inhibition of c-CBL E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitination of POL&#x3b8; and its proteasomal degradation. Overexpression of POL&#x3b8; in OTK-positive cells resulted in the efficient repair of DPC-containing DNA double-strand breaks by POL&#x3b8;-mediated end-joining. The transforming activities of OTKs and other leukemia-inducing oncogenes, especially of those causing the inhibition of BRCA1/2-mediated homologous recombination with and without concomitant inhibition of DNA-PK-dependent nonhomologous end-joining, was abrogated in Polq-/- murine bone marrow cells. Genetic and pharmacological targeting of POL&#x3b8; polymerase and helicase activities revealed that both activities are promising targets in leukemia cells. Moreover, OTK inhibitors or DPC-inducing drug etoposide enhanced the antileukemia effect of POL&#x3b8; inhibitor in&#xa0;vitro and in&#xa0;vivo. In conclusion, we demonstrated that POL&#x3b8; plays an essential role in protecting leukemia cells from metabolically induced toxic DNA lesions triggered by formaldehyde, and it can be targeted to achieve a therapeutic effect.",2023,Animals; Mice; BRCA1 Protein; BRCA2 Protein; DNA; DNA Damage; Leukemia,9

Peposertib is an inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which is a key driver of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). To identify regulators of response to peposertib, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen and found that loss of POLQ (polymerase theta, POL&#x3b8;) and other genes in the microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) pathway are key predictors of sensitivity to DNA-PK inhibition. Simultaneous disruption of two DNA repair pathways via combined treatment with peposertib plus a POL&#x3b8; inhibitor novobiocin exhibited synergistic synthetic lethality resulting from accumulation of toxic levels of DNA double-strand break end resection. TP53-mutant tumor cells were resistant to peposertib but maintained elevated expression of POLQ and increased sensitivity to novobiocin. Consequently, the combination of peposertib plus novobiocin resulted in synthetic lethality in TP53-deficient tumor cell lines, organoid cultures, and patient-derived xenograft models. Thus, the combination of a targeted DNA-PK/NHEJ inhibitor with a targeted POL&#x3b8;/MMEJ inhibitor may provide a rational treatment strategy for TP53-mutant solid tumors. Combined inhibition of NHEJ and MMEJ using two nontoxic, targeted DNA repair inhibitors can effectively induce toxic DNA damage to treat TP53-deficient cancers.",2022,DNA; DNA End-Joining Repair; DNA Repair; DNA-Activated Protein Kinase; DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Humans; Neoplasms; Novobiocin; Pyridazines; Quinazolines; Synthetic Lethal Mutations; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53,9

This study aimed to elucidate its clinicopathological and molecular features. The study cohort included 10 patients with pancreatic USC. Clinicopathological parameters were determined for each patient. The molecular profile was investigated using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Histologically, all tumors were hypercellular neoplasms with spindle-shaped or sarcomatoid cells. All patients showed vascular and perineural invasion. Most patients had a poor prognosis. NGS showed important similarities with conventional PDAC, including frequent alterations in the classic PDAC drivers, KRAS (100% of cases), TP53 (90%), and CDKN2A (60%). There were also some important distinctions from conventional PDAC: 1) SMAD4, a typical PDAC driver gene, was mutated in only one case (10%); 2) Another distinctive molecular feature was the recurrent KRAS amplification (30% of cases), which is very rare in conventional PDAC. It has been previously reported in another subtype of pancreatic undifferentiated carcinoma, the rhabdoid variant, and may be a key event leading to the acquisition of an undifferentiated phenotype in a subgroup of cases; 3) Lastly, in two different cases, we detected two potentially actionable targets, not belonging to the typical PDAC molecular landscape, such as MCL1 amplification and POLQ mutation. Our study sheds light on this rare tumor type, which shows aggressive biological behavior and few druggable alterations.

This study's objective was to characterise the mutational landscape of Indian prostate cancer using whole-exome sequencing to identify population-specific polymorphisms. Whole-exome sequencing was performed of 58 treatment-naive primary prostate tumors of Indian origin. Multiple computational and statistical analyses were used to profile the known common mutations, other deleterious mutations, driver genes, prognostic biomarkers, and gene signatures unique to each clinical parameter. Cox analysis was performed to validate survival-associated genes. McNemar test identified genes significant to recurrence and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to determine its accuracy. OncodriveCLUSTL algorithm was used to deduce driver genes. The druggable target identified was modeled with its known inhibitor using Autodock. TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene in our cohort. Three novel deleterious variants unique to the Indian prostate cancer subtype were identified: POLQ, FTHL17, and OR8G1. COX regression analysis identified ACSM5, a mitochondrial gene responsible for survival. CYLC1 gene, which encodes for sperm head cytoskeletal protein, was identified as an unfavorable prognostic biomarker indicative of recurrence. The novel POLQ mutant, also identified as a driver gene, was evaluated as the druggable target in this study. POLQ, a DNA repair enzyme implicated in various cancer types, is overexpressed and is associated with a poor prognosis. The mutant POLQ was subjected to structural analysis and modeled with its known inhibitor novobiocin resulting in decreased binding efficiency necessitating the development of a better drug. In this pilot study, the molecular profiling using multiple computational and statistical analyses revealed distinct polymorphisms in the Indian prostate cancer cohort. The mutational signatures identified provide a valuable resource for prognostic stratification and targeted treatment strategies for Indian prostate cancer patients.

Faults in the DDR are a known driver and hallmark of cancer. Furthermore, inhibition of DDR enzymes can be used to treat the disease. This is exemplified by PARP inhibitors (PARPi) used to treat cancers with defects in the homologous recombination DDR pathway. A series of novel DDR targets are now also under pre-clinical or clinical investigation, including inhibitors of ATR kinase, WRN helicase or the DNA polymerase/helicase Pol&#x3b8; (Pol-Theta). Drug resistance is a common phenomenon that impairs the overall effectiveness of cancer treatments and there is already some understanding of how resistance to PARPi occurs. Here, we discuss how an understanding of PARPi resistance could inform how resistance to new drugs targeting the DDR emerges.

However, cancer cells might become dependent on the normal cellular functions of certain genes that are not oncogenes but ensure cell survival (non-oncogene addiction). The downregulation or silencing of DNA repair genes and the consequent genetic and epigenetic instability is key to promote malignancy, but the activation of the DNA-damage response (DDR) has been shown to become a type of non-oncogene addiction that critically supports tumour survival. In the present study, a systematic evaluation of DNA repair addiction at the pan-cancer level was performed using data derived from The Cancer Dependency Map and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). From 241 DDR genes, 59 were identified as commonly essential in cancer cell lines. However, large differences were observed in terms of dependency scores in 423 cell lines and transcriptomic alterations across 18 cancer types. Among these 59 commonly essential genes, 14 genes were exclusively associated with better overall patient survival and 19 with worse overall survival. Notably, a specific molecular signature among the latter, characterized by DDR genes like UBE2T, RFC4, POLQ, BRIP1, and H2AFX showing the weakest dependency scores, but significant upregulation was strongly associated with worse survival.

As the DNA repair pathway is an important driver in tumor response to DDP, we analyzed the mRNA expression of 20 genes involved in the nucleotide excision repair, fanconi anemia, homologous recombination, base excision repair, mismatch repair and translesion repair pathways and the methylation patterns of some of these genes. We also investigated the correlation with the response to platinum-based therapy. The mRNA levels of the selected genes were evaluated by Real Time-PCR (RT-PCR) with <i>ad hoc</i> validated primers and gene promoter methylation by pyrosequencing. All the DNA repair genes were variably expressed in all 42 PDX samples analyzed, with no particular histotype-specific pattern of expression. In high-grade serous/endometrioid PDXs, the CDK12 mRNA expression levels positively correlated with the expression of TP53BP1, PALB2, XPF and POLB. High-grade serous/endometrioid PDXs with <i>TP53</i> mutations had significantly higher levels of POLQ, FANCD2, RAD51 and POLB than high-grade <i>TP53</i> wild type PDXs. The mRNA levels of CDK12, PALB2 and XPF inversely associated with the <i>in vivo</i> DDP antitumor activity; higher CDK12 mRNA levels were associated with a higher recurrence rate in ovarian patients with low residual tumor.

Both genes individually act as drivers of liver cancer initiation and progression. However, their concomitant alteration in HCC has not been explored, nor functionally documented. Here, we analysed databases of five independent human HCC cohorts and found a subset of patients with high levels of MYC and MET (MYC<sup>high</sup>/MET<sup>high</sup>) characterised by poor prognosis. This clinical observation drove us to explore the functionality of MYC and MET co-occurrence in vivo, combining hydrodynamic tail vein injection for MYC expression in the R26<sup>stopMet</sup> genetic setting, in which wild-type MET levels are enhanced following the genetic deletion of a stop cassette. Results showed that increased MYC and MET expression in hepatocytes is sufficient to induce liver tumorigenesis even in the absence of pre-existing injuries associated with a chronic disease state. Intriguingly, ectopic MYC in MET tumours increases expression of the Mki67 proliferation marker, and switches them into loss of Afp, Spp1, Gpc3, Epcam accompanied by an increase in Hgma1, Vim, and Hep-Par1 levels. We additionally found a switch in the expression of specific immune checkpoints, with an increase in the Ctla-4 and Lag3 lymphocyte co-inhibitory responses, and in the Icosl co-stimulatory responses of tumour cells. We provide in vitro evidence on the vulnerability of some human HCC cell lines to combined MYC and MET targeting, which are otherwise resistant to single inhibition. Mechanistically, combined blockage of MYC and MET converts a partial cytostatic effect, triggered by individual blockage of MYC or MET, into a cytotoxic effect.

From The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program, we downloaded multiomics data of ten cancer cohorts and investigated the correlations between <i>TRPV1</i> expression and immune signatures' enrichment, stromal content, genomic features, oncogenic signaling, and clinical features in these cancer cohorts and pan-cancer. Elevated expression of <i>TRPV1</i> correlated with better clinical outcomes in pan-cancer and diverse cancer types. In multiple cancer types, <i>TRPV1</i> expression correlated negatively with the expression of tumor proliferation marker genes (<i>MKI67</i> and <i>RACGAP1</i>), proliferation scores, cell cycle scores, stemness scores, epithelial-mesenchymal transition scores, oncogenic pathways' enrichment, tumor immunosuppressive signals, intratumor heterogeneity, homologous recombination deficiency, tumor mutation burden, and stromal content. Moreover, <i>TRPV1</i> expression was downregulated in late-stage versus early-stage tumors. In breast cancer, bladder cancer, and low-grade glioma, <i>TRPV1</i> expression was more inferior in invasive than in noninvasive subtypes. Pathway analysis showed that the enrichment of cancer-associated pathways correlated inversely with <i>TRPV1</i> expression levels. <i>TRPV1</i> upregulation correlates with decreased tumor proliferation, tumor driver gene expression, genomic instability, and tumor immunosuppressive signals in various cancers. Our results provide new understanding of the role of TRPV1 in both cancer biology and clinical practice.",2022,NA,8

Identifying novel drivers of growth and metastasis hold therapeutic potential for the disease. Transport homeostasis between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi and the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) mediated by Golgi have been reported to be closely associated with tumor progression. However, to date, mechanistic studies remain limited. Here, we identified KDELR2 as a potential risk factor with prognostic value in patients with BCa, especially those harbouring the KDELR2 amplification. In addition, we found that KDELR2 is a regulator of BCa cell proliferation and tumorigenicity based on bioinformatic analysis with functional studies. Mechanistically, we revealed that KDELR2 could regulate the expression of KIF20A, thus stimulating the expression of MMP2, MMP9 and MKI67. Functionally, the overexpression of KDELR2 and KIF20A markedly promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and enhanced tumor growth in vivo, while knockdown of KDELR2 and KIF20A exerted the opposite effects. And the overexpression of KDELR2 also enhanced lymph node metastasis in vivo. Collectively, our findings clarified a hitherto unexplored mechanism of KDELR2-KIF20A axis in increasing Golgi-mediated secretion of MMPs to drive tumor progression in BCa.",2022,Bladder cancer (BCa); KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 2 (KDELR2); Kinesin family member 20A (KIF20A); MMPs; Prognosis,8

The current neuro-oncology practice has incorporated genes involved in key molecular events that drive GBM tumorigenesis as biomarkers to guide diagnosis and design treatment. This study summarizes findings describing the significant heterogeneity of GBM at the transcriptional and genomic levels, emphasizing 18 driver genes with clinical relevance. A pattern was identified fitting the stem cell model for GBM ontogenesis, with an upregulation profile for <i>MGMT</i> and downregulation for <i>ATRX, H3F3A, TP53</i> and <i>EGFR</i> in the mesenchymal subtype. We also detected overexpression of <i>EGFR, NES, VIM</i> and <i>TP53</i> in the classical subtype and of <i>MKi67</i> and <i>OLIG2</i> genes in the proneural subtype. Furthermore, we found a combination of the four biomarkers <i>EGFR, NES, OLIG2</i> and <i>VIM</i> with a remarkable differential expression pattern which confers them a strong potential to determine the GBM molecular subtype. A unique distribution of somatic mutations was found for the young and adult population, particularly for genes related to DNA repair and chromatin remodelling, highlighting <i>ATRX, MGMT</i> and <i>IDH1.</i> Our results also revealed that highly lesioned genes undergo differential regulation with particular biological pathways for young patients.

31663659,MKI67,10.1111/cpr.12710,Pre-clinical evidences for the efficacy of tryptanthrin as a potent suppressor of skin cancer.,"Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of indigo naturalis, a traditional Chinese medicine ingredient, against psoriasis, a skin disease characterized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation and inflammation. The present study investigates the efficacy of tryptanthrin, a bioactive compound in indigo naturalis, against non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and the signalling events involved. Efficacy of tryptanthrin against NMSC was assessed using DMBA/PMA-induced skin carcinogenesis model in Swiss albino mice. Immunostaining for PCNA and ki-67 was used to mark proliferating cells in tissues. Haematoxylin and eosin staining and toluidine staining were employed to assess inflammation, and TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis in tissues. The signalling events were evaluated using Western blot, imunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. MTT assay and clonogenic assay were performed to assess the viability and proliferation of cancer cells, in vitro. In mice, topical application of tryptanthrin suppressed skin carcinogenesis. It attenuated inflammation, impeded the proliferation of hair follicle (HF) cells and suppressed the activation of &#x3b2;-catenin, a major driver of HF cell proliferation. Additionally tryptanthrin suppressed the activation of ERK1/2 and p38, both of which promote &#x3b2;-catenin activation and lowered the expression of c-Myc and cyclin-D1. Tryptanthrin suppressed the proliferation of the human NMSC cell line, A431 and abrogated EGF-induced activation of &#x3b2;-catenin and subsequent cytoskeletal rearrangement.

Adults with histologically proven MLG diagnosed between 1996 and 2017 were identified from our tumor bank, systematically reviewed, and reclassified according to WHO 2016. Targeted sequencing was performed, including determination of <i>H3F3A</i>, <i>HIST1H3B</i>, <i>TERTp</i>, <i>IDH1/2</i>, <i>FGFR1</i>, <i>p16/CDKN2A</i>, and <i>EGFR</i> status. A total of 116 adult patients (M/F 71/45, median age 46.5 years) with MLG (17 cerebellar, 8 spinal, 30 brainstem, 57 thalamic, and 4 diencephalic nonthalamic) were identified.

Androgen signaling is a known and major driver for prostate cancer progression. Therefore, we analyzed major components of the androgen signaling chain and cell proliferation in relation to type 2 diabetes. Tumor content of 70 prostate tissue samples of men with type 2 diabetes and 59 samples of patients without diabetes was quantified by an experienced pathologist, and a subset of 51 samples was immunohistochemically stained for androgen receptor (AR). mRNA expression of AR, insulin receptor isoform A (IR-A) and B (IR-B), IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R), Cyp27A1 and Cyp7B1, PSA gene KLK3, PSMA gene FOLH1, Ki-67 gene MKI67, and estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) were analyzed by RT-qPCR. AR mRNA and protein expression were associated with the tumor content only in men with diabetes. AR expression also correlated with downstream targets PSA (KLK3) and PSMA (FOLH1) and increased cell proliferation. Only in diabetes, AR expression was correlated to higher IR-A/IR-B ratio and lower IR-B/IGF1R ratio, thus, in favor of the mitogenic isoforms. Reduced Cyp27A1 and increased Cyp7B1 expressions in tumor suggest lower levels of protective estrogen receptor ligands in diabetes. We report elevated androgen receptor signaling and activity presumably due to altered insulin/IGF-1 receptors and decreased levels of protective estrogen receptor ligands in prostate cancer in men with diabetes.

However, MHT therapies were controversial with the increased risk of breast cancer because of different estrogen and progestogen combinations, and the molecular basis behind this phenomenon is currently not understood. To address this issue, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the estrogen plus progestogens treatment (EPT) and estrogen treatment (ET) using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. As a result, a total of 96 upregulated DEGs were first identified. Seven DEGs related to the cell cycle (CCNE2, CDCA5, RAD51, TCF19, KNTC1, MCM10, and NEIL3) were validated by RT-qPCR. Specifically, these seven DEGs were increased in EPT compared to ET (p &lt; 0.05) and had higher expression levels in breast cancer than adjacent normal tissues (p &lt; 0.05). Next, we found that estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients with a higher CNNE2 expression have a shorter overall survival time (p &lt; 0.05), while this effect was not observed in the other six DEGs (p &gt; 0.05). Interestingly, the molecular docking results showed that CCNE2 might bind to 17&#x3b2;-estradiol (&#x2212;6.791 kcal/mol), progesterone (&#x2212;6.847 kcal/mol), and medroxyprogesterone acetate (&#x2212;6.314 kcal/mol) with a relatively strong binding affinity, respectively. Importantly, CNNE2 protein level could be upregulated with EPT and attenuated by estrogen receptor antagonist, acolbifene and had interactions with cancer driver genes (AKT1 and KRAS) and high mutation frequency gene (TP53 and PTEN) in breast cancer patients. In conclusion, the current study showed that CCNE2, CDCA5, RAD51, TCF19, KNTC1, MCM10, and NEIL3 might contribute to EPT-related tumorigenesis in breast cancer, with CCNE2 might be a sensitive risk indicator of breast cancer risk in women using MHT.",2022,"bioinformatic analysis; breast cancer; estrogen plus progestogens treatment; menopausal hormone therapy; Breast Neoplasms; Computational Biology; Estradiol; Estrogen Receptor Antagonists; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Estrogens; Female; Humans; Medroxyprogesterone Acetate; Menopause; Molecular Docking Simulation; Progesterone; Progestins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Receptors, Estrogen; Transcription Factors",1

Here, we found that the oncoprotein Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) acts as a potential driver for tumor growth in TNBC and, surprisingly, through a proteomic screen, we identified USP7 as a major regulator of FOXM1 in TNBC cells. USP7 interacts with FOXM1 both in vitro and in vivo. USP7 stabilizes FOXM1 through deubiquitination. Conversely, RNAi-mediated USP7 knockdown in TNBC cells, dramatically reduced the levels of FOXM1. Moreover, based upon the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology, we generated PU7-1 (protein degrader for USP7-1), as a USP7 specific degrader. PU7-1 induces rapid USP7 degradation at low nanomolar concentrations in cells but shows no obvious effect on other USP family proteins. Strikingly, the treatment of TNBC cells with PU7-1 significantly abrogates FOXM1 functions and effectively suppresses cell growth in vitro. By using xenograft mouse models, we found that PU7-1 markedly represses tumor growth in vivo. Notably, ectopic overexpression of FOXM1 can reverse the tumor growth suppressive effects induced by PU7-1, underscored the specific effect on FOXM1 induced by USP7 inactivation. Together, our findings indicate that FOXM1 is a major target of USP7 in modulating tumor growth in a p53-independent manner and reveals the USP7 degrader as a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancers.",2023,NA,71

Clustering extra centrosomes is a major coping mechanism required for faithful mitosis of cancer cells with CA that would otherwise undergo mitotic catastrophe and cell death. However, its underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully described. Furthermore, little is known about the processes and players triggering aggressiveness of cells with CA beyond mitosis. Here, we identified Transforming Acidic Coiled-Coil Containing Protein 3 (TACC3) to be overexpressed in tumors with CA, and its high expression is associated with dramatically worse clinical outcome. We demonstrated, for the first time, that TACC3 forms distinct functional interactomes regulating different processes in mitosis and interphase to ensure proliferation and survival of cancer cells with CA. Mitotic TACC3 interacts with the Kinesin Family Member C1 (KIFC1) to cluster extra centrosomes for mitotic progression, and inhibition of this interaction leads to mitotic cell death via multipolar spindle formation. Interphase TACC3 interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex (HDAC2 and MBD2) in nucleus to inhibit the expression of key tumor suppressors (e.g., p21, p16 and APAF1) driving G1/S progression, and its inhibition blocks these interactions and causes p53-independent G1 arrest and apoptosis. Notably, inducing CA by p53 loss/mutation increases the expression of TACC3 and KIFC1 via FOXM1 and renders cancer cells highly sensitive to TACC3 inhibition. Targeting TACC3 by guide RNAs or small molecule inhibitors strongly inhibits growth of organoids and breast cancer cell line- and patient-derived xenografts with CA by induction of multipolar spindles, mitotic and G1 arrest. Altogether, our results show that TACC3 is a multifunctional driver of highly aggressive breast tumors with CA and that targeting TACC3 is a promising approach to tackle this disease.",2023,"Humans; Female; Spindle Apparatus; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Breast Neoplasms; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Centrosome; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA-Binding Proteins",71

However, the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that the splicing events specifically active during human organogenesis, are broadly reactivated in the organ-specific tumor. Such events are associated with key oncogenic processes and predict proliferation rates in cancer cell lines as well as patient survival. Such events preferentially target nitrosylation and transmembrane-region domains, whose coordinated splicing in multiple genes respectively affect intracellular transport and N-linked glycosylation. We infer critical splicing factors potentially regulating embryonic splicing events and show that such factors are potential oncogenic drivers and are upregulated specifically in malignant cells. Multiple complementary analyses point to MYC and FOXM1 as potential transcriptional regulators of critical splicing factors in brain and liver. Our study provides a comprehensive demonstration of a splicing-mediated link between development and cancer, and suggest anti-cancer targets including splicing events, and their upstream splicing and transcriptional regulators.",2022,"Humans; Alternative Splicing; RNA Splicing; Neoplasms; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; RNA Splicing Factors",71

However, most patients whose tumor initially responded to the first-generation EGFR-TKI developed acquired resistance. In this study, we developed a novel combination strategy, ""antiADAM17 antibody A9(B8)&#x2009;+&#x2009;EGFR-TKIs"", to enhance the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs. The addition of A9(B8) was shown to restore the effectiveness of erlotinib and overcome acquired resistance. We found that when A9(B8) antibody was treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, the combination treatment synergistically increased apoptosis in an NSCLC cell line and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, the addition of A9(B8) could only reduce the survival of the erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cell line and inhibit the growth of erlotinib-resistant tumors in vivo but not gefitinib-resistant cells. Furthermore, we revealed that A9(B8) overcame erlotinib resistance through the FOXO3a/FOXM1 axis and arrested the cell cycle at the G<sub>1</sub>/S phase, resulting in the apoptosis of cancer cells. Hence, this study establishes a novel, promising strategy for overcoming acquired resistance to erlotinib through the FOXO3a/FOXM1 axis by arresting the cell cycle at the G<sub>1</sub>/S phase.",2022,"Antibody therapy; Cell death; Drug target; Precision oncology; Small molecule; Humans; Antibodies; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Drug Resistance; ErbB Receptors; Erlotinib Hydrochloride; Forkhead Box Protein M1; Gefitinib; Lung Neoplasms; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm",71

The molecular basis of early disease onset is still elusive. We recruited 472 female breast cancer from two sub-Saharan African countries (Cameroon and Congo) between 2007 and 2018 and collected clinical data from these patients. To investigate the molecular drivers of early disease onset, we analyzed publicly available breast cancer molecular data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and the gene expression omnibus (GEO) for copy number alteration, mutation and gene expression. Early BC onset (EOBRCA) (diagnosis before 45&#xa0;years) was higher in African women compared with the TCGA cohort (51.7% vs 15.6%). The tumor grade, mitotic index, HER2&#x2009;+&#x2009;phenotype, basal-like phenotype and ki67 were higher in EOBRCA for all cohorts. BC risk factors such as parity, breastfeeding early onset of menarche and use of hormonal contraceptives were significantly associated with EOBRCA (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). EOBRCA was equally associated with copy number alterations in several oncogenes including CDH6 and FOXM1 and tumor suppressor including TGM3 and DMBT1 as well as higher TP53 mutation rates (OR: 2.93, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). There was a significant enrichment of TGF&#xdf; signaling in EOBRCA with TGM3 deletions, which was associated with high expression of all SMAD transcription factors as well as WNT ligands. The Frizzled receptors FZD1, FZD4 and FZD6 were significantly upregulated in EOBRCA, suggesting activation of non-canonical WNT signaling.

Alternative meningioma grouping schemes using copy number variants, gene expression profiles, somatic short variants, or integrated molecular models have been proposed. These data suggest meningioma DNA methylation groups may harbor subgroups unifying contrasting theories of meningioma biology. A total of 565 meningioma DNA methylation profiles from patients with comprehensive clinical follow-up at independent discovery (n = 200) or validation (n = 365) institutions were reanalyzed and classified into Merlin-intact, Immune-enriched, or Hypermitotic DNA methylation groups. RNA sequencing from the discovery (n = 200) or validation (n = 302) cohort were analyzed in the context of DNA methylation groups to identify subgroups. Biological features and clinical outcomes were analyzed across meningioma grouping schemes. RNA sequencing revealed differential enrichment of FOXM1 target genes across two subgroups of Hypermitotic meningiomas. Differential expression and ontology analyses showed the subgroup of Hypermitotic meningiomas without FOXM1 target gene enrichment was distinguished by gene expression programs driving macromolecular metabolism. Analysis of genetic, epigenetic, gene expression, or cellular features revealed Hypermitotic meningioma subgroups were concordant with Proliferative or Hypermetabolic meningiomas, which were previously reported alongside Merlin-intact and Immune-enriched tumors using an integrated molecular model. The addition of DNA methylation subgroups to clinical models refined the prediction of postoperative outcomes compared to the addition of DNA methylation groups.

FOXM1, a proliferation-associated transcription factor, is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors as a key driver of tumorigenesis and cancer progression, and is a potential anticancer therapeutic target. However, FOXM1-targeting p-PROTACs has not been researched. Here, we first analyzed the expression of FOXM1, GLUT1 and PD-L1 in liver cancer through database and clinical samples of patients. FOXM1-targeting peptides, selected by screening phage display library, are verified its targeting effect by immunofluorescence and CCK-8 test. The novel p-PROTAC degrader of FOXM1 is chemically synthesis, named FOXM1-PROTAC, by linking a FOXM1-binding antagonistic peptide, with the E3 ubiquitin ligase recruitment ligand Pomalidomide and with the cell membrane penetrating peptide TAT. Its degradation effect on FOXM1 was detected by Western blotting, qPCR, and we verified its effect on the behavior of cancer cells by flow cytometry, scratch assay, and Transwell in vitro. The tumor xenografted mice model was used for evaluating FOXM1-PROTAC therapeutic response in vivo. Finally, we detected the expression of GLUT1 and PD-L1 after FOXM1-PROTAC degraded FOXM1 by using Western Blotting and hippocampal detectors and dual immunofluorescence. We found that the novel FOXM1-PROTAC efficiently entered cells and induced degradation of FOXM1 protein, which strongly inhibits viability as well as migration and invasion in various cancer cell lines, and suppressed tumor growth in HepG2 and MDA-MB-231 cells xenograft mouse models, without detected toxicity in normal tissues. Meanwhile, FOXM1-PROTAC decreased the cancer cells glucose metabolism via downregulating the protein expression levels of glucose transporter GLUT1 and the immune checkpoint PD-L1, which suggests involvement of FOXM1 in cancer cell metabolism and immune regulation. Our results indicate that biologically targeted degradation of FOXM1 is an attractive therapeutic strategy, and antagonist peptide-containing FOXM1-PROTACs as both degrader and inhibitor of FOXM1 could be developed as a safe and promising drug for FOXM1-overexpressed cancer therapy.",2022,Breast cancer; FOXM1; GLUT1; Liver cancer; P-PROTACs; PD-L1; Animals; Humans; Mice; B7-H1 Antigen; Cell-Penetrating Peptides; Forkhead Box Protein M1; Glucose; Glucose Transporter Type 1; Ligands; Neoplasms; Proteolysis; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases,71
36119839,FOXM1,,USP39 facilitates breast cancer cell proliferation through stabilization of FOXM1.,"Deubiquitinating enzyme dysregulation has been linked to the development of a variety of human malignancies, including breast cancer. However, the exact involvement of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP39 in the progression of breast cancer is yet unknown. Cell viability and colony formation analysis was used to assess the effects of USP39 knockdown on breast cancer cells in this study. The interaction between USP39 and FOXM1 was investigated using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and in vitro deubiquitination analysis. The expression of USP39 and FOXM1 in breast cancer tissues was studied using the TCGA database. According to our findings, USP39 deubiquitinates and stabilizes FOXM1, promoting breast cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, elevated USP39 expression lowers FOXM1 ubiquitination, resulting in increased transcriptional activity. In addition, the high expression of USP39 reduces the ubiquitination of FOXM1, thereby enhancing the transcriptional activity of FOXM1 and regulating the expression of downstream genes Cdc25b and Plk1. USP39 is positively correlated with the expression level of FOXM1 in breast cancer cells. In general, our research revealed the USP39-FOXM1 axis as a critical driver of breast cancer cell proliferation and provided a theoretical foundation for targeting the USP39-FOXM1 axis for pancreatic cancer treatment.",2022,Breast cancer; cell proliferation; transcription factor FOXM1; ubiquitin-specific protease 39,71

Using primary human melanocytes representing the full human skin pigment continuum and preclinical melanoma models, we show that cell-intrinsic differences between dark and light melanocytes regulate melanocyte proliferative capacity and susceptibility to malignant transformation, independent of melanin and ultraviolet exposure. These differences result from dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), a melanin precursor synthesized at higher levels in melanocytes from darkly pigmented skin. We used both high-throughput pharmacologic and genetic in vivo CRISPR screens to determine that DOPA limits melanocyte and melanoma cell proliferation by inhibiting the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M<sub>1</sub> (CHRM1) signaling. Pharmacologic CHRM1 antagonism in melanoma leads to depletion of c-Myc and FOXM1, both of which are proliferation drivers associated with aggressive melanoma. In preclinical mouse melanoma models, pharmacologic inhibition of CHRM1 or FOXM1 inhibited tumor growth. CHRM1 and FOXM1 may be new therapeutic targets for melanoma.",2023,NA,71

Epigenetic factors include a large family of members and understanding their function in cancer has been a hot topic. LncRNAs are RNA molecules with no capacity in synthesis of proteins, and they have regulatory functions in cells. LncRNAs are localized in nucleus and cytoplasm, and their abnormal expression is related to development of tumor. This manuscript emphasizes on the role of lncRNA H19 in various cancers and its association with tumor hallmarks. The function of lncRNA H19 in most tumors is oncogenic and therefore, tumor cells increase its expression for promoting their progression. LncRNA H19 contributes to enhancing growth and cell cycle of cancers and by EMT induction, it is able to elevate metastasis rate. Silencing H19 induces apoptotic cell death and disrupts progression of tumors. LncRNA H19 triggers chemo- and radio-resistance in cancer cells. miRNAs are dually upregulated/down-regulated by lncRNA H19 in increasing tumor progression. Anti-cancer agents reduce lncRNA H19 in impairing tumor progression and increasing therapy sensitivity. A number of downstream targets and molecular pathways for lncRNA H19 have been detected in cancers including miRNAs, RUNX1, STAT3, &#x3b2;-catenin, Akt2 and FOXM1. Clinical studies have revealed potential of lncRNA H19 as biomarker and its association with poor prognosis.

Human Plant Homeodomain (PHD) finger protein 1 (PHF1) coordinates with H3K36me3 to increase nucleosomal DNA accessibility. Previous studies revealed that PHF1 is markedly upregulated in various tumors and enhances cell proliferation, migration and tumorigenesis. However, its roles in LUAD are still unknown. We aimed to depict the biological roles of PHF1 and identify useful targets for clinical treatment of LUAD. Based on the bioinformatic analysis, we found that PHF1 was down-regulated in LUAD samples and low PHF1 expressions correlated with unfavorable clinical characteristics. Patients with low PHF1 had poorer survival outcomes relative to those with high PHF1. Targeting PHF1 potentiated cell growth, migration and in vivo proliferation. Mechanistically, FTO mediated the stabilization of PHF1 mRNA by demethylating m6A, which particularly prevented YTHDF2 from degrading PHF1 transcripts. Of note, FTO also expressed lowly in LUAD that predicts poor prognosis of patients. FTO inhibition promoted LUAD progression, and PHF1 overexpression could reverse the effect. Lastly, down-regulated FTO/PHF1 axis could mainly elevate FOXM1 expression to potentiate the self-renewal capacity. Targeting FOXM1 was effective to suppress PHF1<sup>low/-</sup> LUAD growth. Collectively, our findings revealed that FTO positively regulates PHF1 expression and determined the tumor-suppressive role of FTO/PHF1 axis, thereby highlighting insights into its epigenetic remodeling mechanisms in LUAD progression and treatment.",2022,NA,71

Endowed with self-renewing abilities and multilineage differentiation potential, CSCs have emerged as cellular drivers of virtually all facets of tumor biology, including metastasis, tumor recurrence/relapse, and drug resistance. The functional and biological characteristics of CSCs, such as self-renewal, cell fate decisions, survival, proliferation, and differentiation are regulated by an array of extracellular factors, signaling pathways, and pluripotent transcriptional factors. Besides the well-characterized regulatory role of transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4, and MYC in CSCs, evidence for the central role of Forkhead box transcription factor FOXM1 in the establishment, maintenance, and functions of CSCs is accumulating. Conventionally identified as a master regulator of the cell cycle, a comprehensive understanding of this molecule has revealed its multifarious oncogenic potential and uncovered its role in angiogenesis, invasion, migration, self-renewal, and drug resistance. This review compiles the large body of literature that has accumulated in recent years that provides evidence for the mechanisms by which FOXM1 expression promotes stemness in glioblastoma, breast, colon, ovarian, lung, hepatic, and pancreatic carcinomas. We have also compiled the data showing the association of stem cell mediators with FOXM1 using TCGA mRNA expression data. Further, the prognostic importance of FOXM1 and other stem cell markers is presented. The delineation of FOXM1-mediated regulation of CSCs can aid in the development of molecularly targeted pharmacological approaches directed at the selective eradication of CSCs in several human malignancies.",2022,"Cancer stem cells; Carcinogenesis; FOXM1; Malignancies; Self-renewal; Signaling pathways; Humans; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Signal Transduction; Glioblastoma; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Forkhead Box Protein M1",71

Here we show that FOXM1 is a positive regulator of myeloma metabolism that greatly impacts the bioenergetic pathways of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Using FOXM1-deficient myeloma cells as principal experimental model system, we find that FOXM1 increases glucose uptake, lactate output, and oxygen consumption in myeloma. We demonstrate that the novel 1,1-diarylethylene small-compound FOXM1 inhibitor, NB73, suppresses myeloma in cell culture and human-in-mouse xenografts using a mechanism that includes enhanced proteasomal FOXM1 degradation. Consistent with the FOXM1-stabilizing chaperone function of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), the HSP90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, collaborates with NB73 in slowing down myeloma. These findings define FOXM1 as a key driver of myeloma metabolism and underscore the feasibility of targeting FOXM1 for new approaches to myeloma therapy and prevention.",2022,"Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Forkhead Box Protein M1; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glycolysis; Humans; Mice; Multiple Myeloma; Transcription Factors",71

CSCs share critical features with embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The pluripotent transcription factors (TFs) and developmental signaling pathways of ESCs are invariably hijacked by CSCs termed 'oncofetal drivers' in many cancers, which are rarely detectable in adult tissues. The unique expression pattern makes oncofetal proteins ideal therapeutic targets in cancer treatment. Therefore, elucidation of oncofetal drivers in cancers is critical for the development of effective CSCs-directed therapy. In this review, we summarize the common pluripotent TFs such as OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4, MYC, SALL4, and FOXM1, as well as the development signaling including Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin, Hedgehog (Hh), Hippo, Notch, and TGF-&#x3b2; pathways of ESCs and CSCs. We also describe the newly identified oncofetal proteins that drive the self-renewal, plasticity, and therapy-resistance of CSCs.

Ubiquitin-like protein FAT10 has recently been reported to promote tumor chemotherapy resistance. In this study, the expression of FAT10 in PC was significantly higher than that in adjacent noncancerous tissues. Increased expression of FAT10 in PC was related to a late TNM stage and decreased overall survival. Functional experiments revealed that downregulating the expression of FAT10 inhibits the proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PC cells, promotes the apoptosis of PC cells, and enhances sensitivity to gemcitabine chemotherapy. In addition, upregulation of FAT10 increased the expression of FOXM1 protein. The effect of downregulating FAT10 was reversed by FOXM1 overexpression, and FOXM1 knockdown inhibited EMT driven by FAT10 overexpression. Mechanistically, FAT10 stabilized the expression of FOXM1 by competing with ubiquitin to bind FOXM1 and inhibiting the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of FOXM1. In conclusion, the FAT10-FOXM1 axis is a pivotal driver of PC proliferation and gemcitabine resistance, and the results provide novel insights into chemotherapy resistance in PC.",2022,"Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Deoxycytidine; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Forkhead Box Protein M1; Humans; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Signal Transduction; Ubiquitins; Gemcitabine",71

The lncRNA ELDR (EGFR long noncoding downstream RNA) was recently shown to be highly expressed in oral cancers as compared to adjacent nontumor tissue, and we previously reported that ELDR may be an oncogene as inhibition of ELDR reduces tumor growth in oral cancer models. Furthermore, overexpression of ELDR induces proliferation and colony formation in normal oral keratinocytes (NOKs). In this study, we examined in further detail how ELDR drives the neoplastic transformation of normal keratinocytes. We performed RNA-seq analysis on NOKs stably expressing ELDR (NOK-ELDR), which revealed that ELDR enhances the expression of cell cycle-related genes. Expression of Aurora kinase A and its downstream targets Polo-like kinase 1, cell division cycle 25C, cyclin-dependent kinase 1, and cyclin B1 (CCNB1) are significantly increased in NOK-ELDR cells, suggesting induction of G2/M progression. We further identified CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) as a binding partner of ELDR in NOK-ELDR cells. We show that ELDR stabilizes CTCF and increases its expression. Finally, we demonstrate the ELDR-CTCF axis upregulates transcription factor Forkhead box M1, which induces Aurora kinase A expression and downstream G2/M transition.

Prevalence (~96%) of mutant p53 is a hallmark of HGSOC. Estrogen receptor-beta (ER&#x3b2;) has been reported to be another important player in HGSOC, although the pro-versus anti-tumorigenic role of its different isoforms remains unsettled. However, whether there is functional interaction between ER&#x3b2; and mutant p53 in HGSOC is unknown. ER&#x3b2;1 and ER&#x3b2;2 mRNA and protein analysis in HGSOC cell lines demonstrated that ER&#x3b2;2 is the predominant isoform in HGSOC. Specificity of ER&#x3b2;2 antibody was ascertained using cells depleted of ER&#x3b2;2 and ER&#x3b2;1 separately with isoform-specific siRNAs.

Mutational signatures show the anti-viral apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC) enzymes are responsible for the preponderance of mutations in bladder tumour genomes, but no causative viral agent has been identified. BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a common childhood infection that remains latent in the adult kidney, where reactivation leads to viruria. This study provides missing mechanistic evidence linking reactivated BKPyV-infection to bladder cancer risk. We used a mitotically-quiescent, functionally-differentiated model of normal human urothelium to examine BKPyV-infection. BKPyV-infection led to significantly elevated APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B protein, increased deaminase activity and greater numbers of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in the host urothelial genome. BKPyV Large T antigen (LT-Ag) stimulated re-entry from G0 into the cell cycle through inhibition of retinoblastoma protein and activation of EZH2, E2F1 and FOXM1, with cells arresting in G2. The single-stranded DNA displacement loops formed in urothelial cells during BKPyV-infection interacted with LT-Ag to provide a substrate for APOBEC3-activity.

In this study, we aimed to reveal the role of SPAG5 in melanoma and clarify whether FOXM1 (forkhead box protein M1) /ADAM17 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17) /NOTCH1 signaling was involved. The expression of SPAG5 in malignant melanoma (MM) tissues and matched normal tissues was detected using qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Cell viability was tested using CCK-8 (Cell Count Kit-8), colony formation and EdU staining. Cell migration and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) were measured using transwell chambers and immunofluorescent staining. Cell cycle distribution and tumorigenesis were assessed by flow cytometry and in vivo tumor-bearing experiments, respectively. The results demonstrated that the expression of SPAG5 was increased in MM tissues and cells. Downregulation of SPAG5 inhibited cell viability, migration, invasion and EMT, and induced a G1-phase arrest. In addition, downregulation of SPAG5 decreased the expression of FOXM1, thereafter inhibiting the expression of ADAM17, NOTCH1 and HES1. Furthermore, deletion of SPAG5 expression decreased the tumorigenesis of MM A375 cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that SPAG5 was overexpressed in MM.

FoxM1 overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma is reflective of tumor aggressiveness and recurrence, poor prognosis and low survival in patients. In our study, we have identified the antimalarial natural product, Artemisinin, to efficiently curb FoxM1 expression and activity in hepatic cancer cells, thereby exhibiting potential anticancer efficacy. Here, we demonstrated that Artemisinin considerably mitigates FoxM1 transcriptional activity by disrupting its interaction with the promoter region of its downstream targets, thereby suppressing the expression of numerous oncogenic drivers. Augmented level of FoxM1 is implicated in drug resistance of cancer cells, including hepatic tumor cells. Notably, FoxM1 overexpression rendered HCC cells poorly responsive to Artemisinin-mediated cytotoxicity while FoxM1 depletion in resistant liver cancer cells sensitized them to Artemisinin treatment, manifested in lower proliferative and growth index, drop in invasive potential and repressed expression of EMT markers with a concomitantly increased apoptosis. Moreover, Artemisinin, when used in combination with Thiostrepton, an established FoxM1 inhibitor, markedly reduced anchorage-independent growth and displayed more pronounced death in liver cancer cells. We found this effect to be evident even in the resistant HCC cells, thereby putting forth a novel combination therapy for resistant cancer patients. Altogether, our findings provide insight into the pivotal involvement of FoxM1 in the tumor suppressive activities of Artemisinin and shed light on the potential application of Artemisinin for improved therapeutic response, especially in resistant hepatic malignancies. Considering that Artemisinin compounds are in current clinical use with favorable safety profiles, the results from our study will potentiate its utility in juxtaposition with established FoxM1 inhibitors, promoting maximal therapeutic efficacy with minimal adverse effects in liver cancer patients.",2021,FOXM1 (Forkhead box M1); anticancer; anticarcinogenic agent; artemisinin (ART); drug resistance; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),71

The current therapeutic options for BLBC need improvement; hence, elucidating signaling pathways that drive BLBC growth may identify novel targets for the development of effective therapies. Rho GTPases have previously been implicated in promoting tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. These proteins are inactivated by Rho-selective GTPase-activating proteins (RhoGAP), which have generally been presumed to act as tumor suppressors. Surprisingly, RNA-Seq analysis of the Rho GTPase signaling transcriptome revealed high expression of several RhoGAP genes in BLBC tumors, raising the possibility that these genes may be oncogenic. To evaluate this, we examined the roles of two of these RhoGAPs, ArhGAP11A (also known as MP-GAP) and RacGAP1 (also known as MgcRacGAP), in promoting BLBC. Both proteins were highly expressed in human BLBC cell lines, and knockdown of either gene resulted in significant defects in the proliferation of these cells. Knockdown of ArhGAP11A caused CDKN1B/p27-mediated arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, whereas depletion of RacGAP1 inhibited growth through the combined effects of cytokinesis failure, CDKN1A/p21-mediated RB1 inhibition, and the onset of senescence. Random migration was suppressed or enhanced by the knockdown of ArhGAP11A or RacGAP1, respectively. Cell spreading and levels of GTP-bound RhoA were increased upon depletion of either RhoGAP. We have established that, via the suppression of RhoA, ArhGAP11A and RacGAP1 are both critical drivers of BLBC growth, and propose that RhoGAPs can act as oncogenes in cancer.

Clustering extra centrosomes is a major coping mechanism required for faithful mitosis of cancer cells with CA that would otherwise undergo mitotic catastrophe and cell death. However, its underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully described. Furthermore, little is known about the processes and players triggering aggressiveness of cells with CA beyond mitosis. Here, we identified Transforming Acidic Coiled-Coil Containing Protein 3 (TACC3) to be overexpressed in tumors with CA, and its high expression is associated with dramatically worse clinical outcome. We demonstrated, for the first time, that TACC3 forms distinct functional interactomes regulating different processes in mitosis and interphase to ensure proliferation and survival of cancer cells with CA. Mitotic TACC3 interacts with the Kinesin Family Member C1 (KIFC1) to cluster extra centrosomes for mitotic progression, and inhibition of this interaction leads to mitotic cell death via multipolar spindle formation. Interphase TACC3 interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex (HDAC2 and MBD2) in nucleus to inhibit the expression of key tumor suppressors (e.g., p21, p16 and APAF1) driving G1/S progression, and its inhibition blocks these interactions and causes p53-independent G1 arrest and apoptosis. Notably, inducing CA by p53 loss/mutation increases the expression of TACC3 and KIFC1 via FOXM1 and renders cancer cells highly sensitive to TACC3 inhibition. Targeting TACC3 by guide RNAs or small molecule inhibitors strongly inhibits growth of organoids and breast cancer cell line- and patient-derived xenografts with CA by induction of multipolar spindles, mitotic and G1 arrest. Altogether, our results show that TACC3 is a multifunctional driver of highly aggressive breast tumors with CA and that targeting TACC3 is a promising approach to tackle this disease.",2023,"Humans; Female; Spindle Apparatus; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Breast Neoplasms; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Centrosome; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA-Binding Proteins",5

We collected the fresh NSCLC samples and paired normal lung tissue in patients with lung cancer operation, and detected KIFC1 expression using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. To expand on previous smaller-scale studies, NSCLC tissue microarrays (TMA) were analyzed by IHC. Finally, cell lines were employed to further probe the potential mechanisms. In this study, we described that KIFC1 was significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues compared with the corresponding normal tissues. Moreover, KIFC1 overexpression was associated with the poor overall survival (OS) of NSCLC patients, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of KIFC1 significantly suppressed tumor cell proliferation <i>in vitro</i>. Further verification showed that inhibition of KIFC1 gene expression caused the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinases inhibitor p21 and downregulation of the cell cycle driver protein cdc2, which arrested cells in the G2-M phase. we report that increased KIFC1 expression may promote cell proliferation and identified it as a biomarker of unfavorable prognosis in NSCLC patients.",2020,Kinesin family member C1 (KIFC1); cell division cycle protein 2 homolog (cdc2); cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21); non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); prognostic,5

Cancer cells have evolved mechanisms to bundle multiple centrosomes into two spindle poles to avoid multipolar mitosis that can lead to chromosomal segregation defects and eventually cell death. KIFC1, a kinesin-14 family protein, plays an essential role in centrosomal bundling in cancer cells, but its function is not required for normal diploid cell division, suggesting that KIFC1 is an attractive therapeutic target for human cancers. To this end, we have identified the first reported small molecule inhibitor AZ82 for KIFC1. AZ82 bound specifically to the KIFC1/microtubule (MT) binary complex and inhibited the MT-stimulated KIFC1 enzymatic activity in an ATP-competitive and MT-noncompetitive manner with a Ki of 0.043 &#x3bc;M. AZ82 effectively engaged with the minus end-directed KIFC1 motor inside cells to reverse the monopolar spindle phenotype induced by the inhibition of the plus end-directed kinesin Eg5. Treatment with AZ82 caused centrosome declustering in BT-549 breast cancer cells with amplified centrosomes.

In meiotic cells, the kinesin HSET compensates for the lack of centrosomes by focusing acentrosomal MTOCs into two spindle poles. By clustering multiple centrosomes into two spindle poles, HSET also mediates bipolar mitosis in cancer cells with supernumerary centrosomes. However, although dispensable in non-transformed human cells, the role of HSET in cancer cells with two centrosomes has remained elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that HSET is required for proper spindle assembly, stable pole-focusing and survival of cancer cells irrespective of normal or supernumerary centrosome number. Strikingly, we detected pronounced acentrosomal MTOC structures in untreated mitotic cancer cells. While in most cancer cells these acentrosomal MTOCs were rapidly incorporated into the assembling bipolar spindle, some cells eventually established bipolar spindles with acentrosomal poles and free centrosomes. These observations demonstrate that acentrosomal MTOCs were functional and that both centrosomal and acentrosomal mechanisms were required for bipolar spindle organization. Our study shows that HSET is critical for clustering acentrosomal and centrosomal MTOCs during spindle formation in human cancer cells with two bona fide centrosomes. Furthermore, we show that in checkpoint-defective cancer cells, acentrosomal spindle formation and HSET-dependence are partially mediated by a constitutive activation of the DNA damage response. In summary, we propose that acentrosomal spindle assembly mechanisms are hyperactive in cancer cells and promote HSET, a key driver of acentrosomal spindle organization, as an attractive target for cancer therapy.",2013,"Cell Line, Tumor; Centrosome; DNA Damage; Humans; Kinesins; Microtubules; Multiprotein Complexes; Neoplasms; Spindle Apparatus",5

The underlying pathologic molecular events remain poorly understood with a paucity of actionable genetic drivers, which hinders the development of new treatment strategies. We performed large-scale RNA sequencing analysis to identify chimerical transcripts preferentially expressed in luminal B breast cancer. The lead candidate was validated by reverse transcription PCR in breast cancer tissues. The effects of inducible ectopic expression or genetic silencing were assessed by phenotypic assays such as MTS, transwell, and transendothelial migration assays, and by clonogenic assays to assess MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Subcellular fractionation, Western blots, and immunoprecipitation were performed to characterize the protein products and elucidate the engaged mechanisms. Here we report a novel tumor-specific chimeric transcript <i>RAD51AP1-DYRK4</i> preferentially expressed in luminal B tumors. Analysis of 200 ER<sup>+</sup> breast tumors detected <i>RAD51AP1-DYRK4</i> overexpression in 19 tumors (9.5%), which is markedly enriched in the luminal B tumors (17.5%). Ectopic expression of <i>RAD51AP1-DYRK4</i>, but not wild-type <i>RAD51AP1</i>, leads to marked activation of MEK/ERK signaling, and endows increased cell motility and transendothelial migration. More importantly, RAD51AP1-DYRK4 appears to endow increased sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor trametinib through attenuating compensatory activation of HER2/PI3K/AKT under MEK inhibition. This discovery sheds light on a new area of molecular pathobiology of luminal B tumors and implies potential new therapeutic opportunities for more aggressive breast tumors overexpressing this fusion.",2022,"Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA-Binding Proteins; Datasets as Topic; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Pyridones; Pyrimidinones; RNA-Binding Proteins; RNA-Seq",2
28112719,RAD51AP1,10.1038/oncsis.2016.88,The role of the cancer stem cell marker CD271 in DNA damage response and drug resistance of melanoma cells.,"Several lines of evidence have suggested that stemness and acquired resistance to targeted inhibitors or chemotherapeutics are mechanistically linked. Here we observed high cell surface and total levels of nerve growth factor receptor/CD271, a marker of melanoma-initiating cells, in sub-populations of chemoresistant cell lines. CD271 expression was increased in drug-sensitive cells but not resistant cells in response to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics etoposide, fotemustine and cisplatin. Comparative analysis of melanoma cells engineered to stably express CD271 or a targeting short hairpin RNA by expression profiling provided numerous genes regulated in a CD271-dependent manner. In-depth analysis of CD271-responsive genes uncovered the association of CD271 with regulation of DNA repair components. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of CD271-responsive genes in drug-resistant cells, among them DNA repair components. Moreover, our comparative screen identified the fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13) as a target of CD271, highly expressed in chemoresistant cells. Further we show that levels of CD271 determine drug response. Knock-down of CD271 in fotemustine-resistant cells decreased expression of FGF13 and at least partly restored sensitivity to fotemustine. Together, we demonstrate that expression of CD271 is responsible for genes associated with DNA repair and drug response. Further, we identified 110 CD271-responsive genes predominantly expressed in melanoma metastases, among them were NEK2, TOP2A and RAD51AP1 as potential drivers of melanoma metastasis. In addition, we provide mechanistic insight in the regulation of CD271 in response to drugs. We found that CD271 is potentially regulated by p53 and in turn is needed for a proper p53-dependent response to DNA-damaging drugs. In summary, we provide for the first time insight in a CD271-associated signaling network connecting CD271 with DNA repair, drug response and metastasis.",2020,NA,2

Unlike canonical oncogenes, NUAK1 is rarely mutated in cancer and appears to function as an obligate facilitator rather than a cancer driver per se. Although numerous groups have developed small-molecule NUAK inhibitors, the circumstances that would trigger their use and the unwanted toxicities that may arise as a consequence of on-target activity are thus undetermined. Reasoning that MYC is a key effector of RAS pathway signalling and the GTPase KRAS is almost uniformly mutated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we investigated whether this cancer type exhibits a functional requirement for NUAK1. Here, we show that high NUAK1 expression is associated with reduced overall survival in PDAC and that inhibition or depletion of NUAK1 suppresses growth of PDAC cells in culture. We identify a previously unknown role for NUAK1 in regulating accurate centrosome duplication and show that loss of NUAK1 triggers genomic instability. The latter activity is conserved in primary fibroblasts, raising the possibility of undesirable genotoxic effects of NUAK1 inhibition.",2023,GSK3&#x3b2;; MYPT1; NUAK1; PDAC; centrosome replication; genomic instability,8

Moreover, high MYADML2 reduced the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Interestingly, immune cell infiltration analysis showed that the dendritic cells, macrophages, and so forth might play important role in HCC progress.

Key to this is the regulated degradation of PLK4, the master regulator of centriole duplication. Here, we show that the Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Tiam1 localises to centrosomes during S-phase, where it is required for the maintenance of normal centriole number. Depletion of Tiam1 leads to an increase in centrosomal PLK4 and centriole overduplication, whereas overexpression of Tiam1 can restrict centriole overduplication. Ultimately, Tiam1 depletion leads to lagging chromosomes at anaphase and aneuploidy, which are potential drivers of malignant progression. The effects of Tiam1 depletion on centrosomal PLK4 levels and centriole overduplication can be rescued by re-expression of both wild-type Tiam1 and catalytically inactive (GEF*) Tiam1, but not by Tiam1 mutants unable to bind to the F-box protein &#x3b2;TRCP (also known as F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 1A) implying that Tiam1 regulates PLK4 levels through promoting &#x3b2;TRCP-mediated degradation independently of Rac1 activation.",2021,Aneuploidy; Centriole; Centriole duplication; PLK4; Tiam1; &#x3b2;TRCP; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Proteins; Centrioles; Centrosome; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases,8

DLX6 antisense RNA 1 (DLX6-AS1) has been identified as an oncogenic driver in NB. However, the mechanisms of DLX6-AS1 in NB progression are not fully understood. Our data showed that DLX6-AS1 was significantly overexpressed in NB tissues and cells. Moreover, DLX6-AS1 silencing repressed NB cell viability, colony formation, migration, and invasion, and promoted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro, as well as decreased tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, DLX6-AS1 operated as a miR-513c-5p sponge. MiR-513c-5p mediated the regulation of DLX6-AS1 on NB cell malignant progression in vitro. PLK4 was a target of miR-513c-5p- and DLX6-AS1-controlled PLK4 expression via sponging miR-513c-5p. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of miR-513c-5p overexpression on NB cell malignant progression in vitro was reversed by PLK4 upregulation.

The success of poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancers that are deficient in homologous recombination exemplifies the utility of synthetically lethal genetic interactions in the treatment of breast cancers that are driven by genomic instability<sup>3</sup>. Given that defects in homologous recombination are present in only a subset of breast cancers, there is a need to identify additional driver mechanisms for genomic instability and targeted strategies to exploit these defects in the treatment of cancer. Here we show that centrosome depletion induces synthetic lethality in cancer cells that contain the 17q23 amplicon, a recurrent copy number aberration that defines about 9% of all primary breast cancer tumours and is associated with high levels of genomic instability<sup>4-6</sup>. Specifically, inhibition of polo-like kinase&#xa0;4 (PLK4) using small molecules leads to centrosome depletion, which triggers mitotic catastrophe in cells that exhibit amplicon-directed overexpression of TRIM37. To explain this effect, we identify TRIM37 as a negative regulator of centrosomal pericentriolar material. In 17q23-amplified cells that lack centrosomes, increased levels of TRIM37 block the formation of foci that comprise pericentriolar material-these foci are structures with a microtubule-nucleating capacity that are required for successful cell division in the absence of centrosomes. Finally, we find that&#xa0;the overexpression of TRIM37 causes genomic instability by delaying centrosome maturation and separation at mitotic entry, and thereby increases the frequency of mitotic errors. Collectively, these findings highlight TRIM37-dependent genomic instability as a putative driver event in 17q23-amplified breast cancer and provide a rationale for the use of centrosome-targeting therapeutic agents in treating these cancers.",2020,"Antineoplastic Agents; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Centrosome; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17; Female; G2 Phase; Genomic Instability; Humans; Mitosis; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Tripartite Motif Proteins; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases",8

Deregulation of these processes can trigger chromosome instability and aneuploidy, which are hallmarks of many solid tumors, including breast cancer. Emerging data from the literature illustrated various functions of Nek2 in breast cancer models, with compelling evidence of its prognostic value in breast tumors. The two kinases control distinct steps in the centrosome-centriole cycle and their dysregulation lead to centrosome amplification, marked by the presence of more than two centrosomes within the cell. We found single or composite overexpression of these kinases in breast tumor samples, regardless of subtype, which strongly associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, in a panel of established cell lines, both kinases are highly expressed in Her2-positive breast cancer cells exhibiting centrosome amplification and trastuzumab resistance.

20348415,PLK4,10.1073/pnas.0910941107,Plk4 is required for cytokinesis and maintenance of chromosomal stability.,"Aneuploidy is a characteristic feature of established cancers and can promote tumor development. Aneuploidy may arise directly, through unequal distribution of chromosomes into daughter cells, or indirectly, through a tetraploid intermediate. The polo family kinase Plk4/Sak is required for late mitotic progression and is haploinsufficient for tumor suppression in mice. Here we show that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) occurs at the Plk4 locus in 50% of human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and is present even in preneoplastic cirrhotic liver nodules. LOH at Plk4 is associated with reduced Plk4 expression in HCC tumors but not with mutations in the remaining allele. Plk4(+/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) at early passage show a high incidence of multinucleation, supernumerary centrosomes, and a near-tetraploid karyotype. Underlying these phenotypes is a high rate of primary cytokinesis failure, associated with aberrant actomyosin ring formation, reduced RhoA activation, and failure to localize the RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor Ect2 to the spindle midbody. We further show that Plk4 normally localizes to the midbody and binds to and phosphorylates Ect2 in vitro. With serial passaging Plk4(+/-) MEFs rapidly immortalize, acquiring an increasing burden of nonclonal and clonal gross chromosomal irregularities, and form tumors in vivo. Our results indicate that haploid levels of Plk4 disrupt RhoGTPase function during cytokinesis, resulting in aneuploidy and tumorigenesis, thus implicating early LOH at Plk4 as one of the drivers of human hepatocellular carcinogenesis.

In this study, we elucidated the molecular diversity among these subtypes by investigating large-scale sequencing datasets. Among genes upregulated from normal, ADC, SQC, LCC to SCLC, six hub genes were found closely correlated with adverse clinical outcome and were testified on cellular or tissue level with quantitative RT-PCR. Cox regression model was then built to generate a risk signature. The possible linkages among these genes were also explored. Transcript levels of BUB1, E2F1, ESPL1, GTSE1, RAB3B, and U2AF2 were found significantly elevated from normal, ADC, SQC, LCC to SCLC. Overexpression of one or multiple of these genes was correlated with adverse overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) in the whole patient cohort or groups stratified according to clinical variables, while most of all six genes were independent prognostic factors. When used as a six-gene risk signature, patients with high signature score displayed more unfavorable clinical variables and poorer outcome. Tight regulative relationships were found within these genes, while BUB1 and E2F1 were likely to be the drivers. We considered the augmented malignancy from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to SCLC might be due to the elevation of these six genes.

Overexpression and deregulated proteolytic activity of Separase as frequently observed in human cancers is associated with the occurrence of supernumerary centrosomes, chromosomal missegregation and aneuploidy. Recently, we have hypothesized that increased Separase proteolytic activity in a small subpopulation of tumor cells may serve as driver of tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Currently, there is no quantitative assay to measure Separase activity levels in single cells. Therefore, we have designed a flow cytometry-based assay that utilizes a Cy5- and rhodamine 110 (Rh110)-biconjugated Rad21 cleavage site peptide ([Cy5-D-R-E-I-M-R]2-Rh110) as smart probe and intracellular substrate for detection of Separase enzyme activity in living cells. As measured by Cy5 fluorescence the cellular uptake of the fluorogenic peptide was fast and reached saturation after 210 min of incubation in human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells. Separase activity was recorded as the intensity of Rh110 fluorescence released after intracellular peptide cleavage providing a linear signal gain within a 90-180 min time slot. Compared to conventional cell extract-based methods the flow cytometric assay delivers equivalent results but is more reliable, bypasses the problem of vague loading controls and unspecific proteolysis associated with whole cell extracts. Especially suited for the investigaton of blood- and bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells the flow cytometric Separase assay allows generation of Separase activity profiles that tell about the number of Separase positive cells within a sample i.e. cells that currently progress through mitosis and about the range of intercellular variation in Separase activity levels within a cell population.

Most of tumors contain multiple genetic subclones, evolving in either succession or in parallel, either in a linear or branching manner, with heterogeneous genome and gene alterations, extensively rewired signaling networks, and addicted to multiple oncogenes easily switching with each other during cancer progression and medical intervention. Hundreds of discovered cancer genes are classified according to whether they function in a dominant (oncogenes) or recessive (tumor suppressor genes) manner in a cancer cell. However, there are many cancer ""gene-chameleons"", which behave distinctly in opposite way in the different experimental settings showing antagonistic duality. In contrast to the widely accepted view that mutant NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases 1/2 (IDH1/2) and associated metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (R)-enantiomer are intrinsically ""the drivers"" of tumourigenesis, mutant IDH1/2 inhibited, promoted or had no effect on cell proliferation, growth and tumorigenicity in diverse experiments. Similar behavior was evidenced for dozens of cancer genes. Gene function is dependent on genetic network, which is defined by the genome context. The overall changes in karyotype can result in alterations of the role and function of the same genes and pathways. The diverse cell lines and tumor samples have been used in experiments for proving gene tumor promoting/suppressive activity. They all display heterogeneous individual karyotypes and disturbed signaling networks. Consequently, the effect and function of gene under investigation can be opposite and versatile in cells with different genomes that may explain antagonistic duality of cancer genes and the cell type- or the cellular genetic/context-dependent response to the same protein.

In cancer, separase is frequently overexpressed, pointing to a functional role as an aneuploidy promoter associated with centrosomal amplification and genomic instability. Recently, we have shown that centrosomal amplification and subsequent chromosomal aberrations are a hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), increasing from chronic phase (CP) toward blast crisis (BC). Moreover, a functional linkage of p210BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity with centrosomal amplification and clonal evolution has been established in long-term cell culture experiments. Unexpectedly, therapeutic doses of imatinib (IM) did not counteract; instead induced similar centrosomal alterations in vitro. We investigated the influence of IM and p210BCR-ABL on Separase as a potential driver of centrosomal amplification in CML. Short-term cell cultures of p210BCR-ABL-negative (NHDF, UROtsa, HL-60, U937), positive (K562, LAMA-84) and inducible (U937p210BCR-ABL/c6 (Tet-ON)) human cell lines were treated with therapeutic doses of IM and analyzed by qRT-PCR, Western blot analysis and quantitative Separase activity assays. Decreased Separase protein levels were observed in all cells treated with IM in a dose dependent manner. Accordingly, in all p210BCR-ABL-negative cell lines, decreased proteolytic activity of Separase was found. In contrast, p210BCR-ABL-positive cells showed increased Separase proteolytic activity. This activation of Separase was consistent with changes in the expression levels of Separase regulators (Separase phosphorylation at serine residue 1126, Securin, CyclinB1 and PP2A). Our data suggest that regulation of Separase in IM-treated BCR-ABL-positive cells occurs on both the protein expression and the proteolytic activity levels.

Here, we interrogate genomic data from thousands of clinical CaP specimens that reflect progression from treatment-na&#xef;ve, to castration-recurrent, and in some cases, neuroendocrine CaP for alterations in cell cycle-associated and -regulated genes, which are central to cancer initiation and progression. We evaluate gene signatures previously curated to evaluate G1-S and G2-M phase transitions or to represent the cell cycle-dependent proteome. The resulting CaP (stage)-specific overview confirmed the presence of well-known driver alterations impacting, for instance, the genes encoding p53 and MYC, and uncovered novel previously unrecognized mutations that affect others such as the PKMYT1 and MTBP genes. The cancer dependency and drugability of representative genomically altered cell cycle determinants were verified also.

We screened for potential targets in CR cells and found that claspin (CLSPN) was overexpressed. CLSPN mRNA knockdown revealed that CLSPN had a role in cisplatin resistance in CR cells. In our previous study, we identified human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02:01-restricted CLSPN peptide by HLA ligandome analysis. Thus, we generated a CLSPN peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte clone that recognized CR cells at a higher level than wild-type UM-UC-3 cells. These findings indicate that CLSPN is a driver of cisplatin resistance and CLSPN peptide-specific immunotherapy may be effective for cisplatin-resistant cases.",2023,Cisplatin resistance; Claspin; Immunotherapy; Urothelial carcinoma,1

We previously identified ATAD2 as a marker and driver of cell proliferation in ovarian cancer (OC); however, the mechanisms whereby ATAD2 is regulated and involved in cell proliferation are still unclear. Here, we disclose that ATAD2 displays a classical G2/M gene signature, functioning to facilitate mitotic progression. ATAD2 ablation caused mitotic arrest and decreased the ability of OC cells to pass through nocodazole-arrested mitosis. ChIP-seq data analyses demonstrated that DREAM and MYBL2-MuvB (MMB), two switchable MuvB-based complexes, bind the CHR elements in the ATAD2 promoter, representing a typical feature and principle mechanism of the periodic regulation of G2/M genes. As a downstream target of MYBL2, ATAD2 deletion significantly impaired MYBL2-driven cell proliferation. Intriguingly, ATAD2 silencing also fed back to destabilize the MYBL2 protein. The significant coexpression of MYBL2 and ATAD2 at both the bulk tissue and single-cell levels highlights the existence of the MYBL2-ATAD2 signaling in OC patients. This signaling is activated during tumorigenesis and correlated with TP53 mutation, and its hyperactivation was found especially in high-grade serous and drug-resistant OCs. Disrupting this signaling by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ATAD2 ablation inhibited the in vivo growth of OC in a subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse model, while pharmacologically targeting this signaling with an ATAD2 inhibitor demonstrated high therapeutic efficacy in both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant OC cells. Collectively, we identified a novel MYBL2-ATAD2 proliferative signaling axis and highlighted its potential application in developing new therapeutic strategies, especially for high-grade serous and drug-resistant OCs.",2023,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Female; Signal Transduction; Cell Proliferation; Ovarian Neoplasms; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Cell Line, Tumor; Trans-Activators; Cell Cycle Proteins; ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities; DNA-Binding Proteins",10

However, nothing is known about the functional network of ATAD2 in stomach carcinogenesis. This study illustrates the oncogenic potential of ATAD2 and the participation of its ATPase and bromodomain in stomach malignancy. Expression of ATAD2 in stomach cancer is analyzed by <i>in silico</i> and <i>in&#xa0;vitro</i> techniques including western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy of stomach cancer cells (SCCs) and tissues. The oncogenic potential of ATAD2 is examined thoroughly using genetic alterations, driver gene prediction, survival analysis, identification of interacting partners, and analysis of canonical pathways. To understand the protein-protein interactions (PPI) at residue level, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations (1200&#x2009;ns) are performed. Enhanced expression of ATAD2 is observed in <i>H. pylori</i>-infected SCCs, patient biopsy tissues, and all stages and grades of stomach cancer. High expression of <i>ATAD2</i> is found to be negatively correlated with the survival of stomach cancer patients. ATAD2 is a cancer driver gene with 37 mutational sites and a predictable factor for stomach cancer prognosis with high accuracy. The top canonical pathways of ATAD2 indicate its participation in stomach malignancy. The ATAD2-PPI in stomach cancer identify top-ranked partners; ESR1, SUMO2, SPTN2, and MYC show preference for the bromodomain whereas NCOA3 and HDA11 have preference for the ATPase domain of ATAD2. The oncogenic characterization of ATAD2 provides strong evidence to consider ATAD2 as a stomach cancer biomarker. These studies offer an insight for the first time into the ATAD2-PPI interface presenting a novel target for cancer therapeutics. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

31746426,ATAD2,10.3892/ijo.2019.4913,ATAD2 predicts poor outcomes in patients with ovarian cancer and is a marker of proliferation.,"The oncogene ATPase family AAA domain&#x2011;&#x200b;containing protein 2 (ATAD2) has been demonstrated to promote malignancy in a number of different types of tumor; however, its expression and role in ovarian cancer (OC) remain unknown. In the present study, it was demonstrated that ATAD2 acts as both a marker and a driver of cell proliferation in OC. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and bioinformatics analyses were used to evaluate ATAD2 expression in OC, and multi&#x2011;omics integrated analyses were used to dissect which factor resulted in its upregulation. Multiplex IHC assay was used to reveal the specific expression of ATAD2 in proliferating OC cells. CRISPR&#x2011;Cas9&#x2011;mediated gene editing was performed to investigate the effect of ATAD2 deletion on OC proliferation. The results demonstrated that ATAD2 is elevated in primary OC tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissue and metastases from the stomach. Genetic copy number amplification is a primary cause resulting in upregulation of ATAD2, and this was most frequently observed in OC. High ATAD2 expression was associated with advanced progression and predicted an unfavorable prognosis. ATAD2 could be used to identify cases of OC with a high proliferation signature and could label proliferating cells in OC. CRISPR&#x2011;Cas9&#x2011;mediated ATAD2 deletion resulted in a significant decrease in both cell proliferation and colony formation ability. Mechanistically, ATAD2&#x2011;knockdown resulted in deactivation of the mitogen&#x2011;activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, particularly the JNK&#x2011;MAPK pathway, resulting in suppression of proliferation. Collectively, the data from the present study demonstrated that the ATD2 gene was frequently amplified and protein expression levels were upregulated in OC. Therefore, ATAD2 may serve as an attractive diagnostic and prognostic OC marker, which may be used to identify patients with primary OC, whom are most likely to benefit from ATAD2 gene&#x2011;targeted proliferation intervention therapies.",2020,"ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities; Biomarkers, Tumor; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cell Proliferation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Ovarian Neoplasms; Prognosis; Survival Rate; Tumor Cells, Cultured",10

In addition, histone acetylation readers such as bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) have been shown to associate with these TFs and contribute to aggressive cancers including prostate cancer (PC). Here, we show that chromatin accessibility defines castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We show that the deregulation of androgen receptor (AR) expression is a driver of chromatin relaxation and that AR/androgen-regulated bromodomain-containing proteins (BRDs) mediate this effect. We also report that BRDs are overexpressed in CRPCs and that ATAD2 and BRD2 have prognostic&#xa0;value. Finally, we developed gene stratification signature (BROMO-10) for bromodomain response and PC prognostication, to inform current and future trials with drugs targeting these processes.

The ATPase family AAA domain-containing 2 (ATAD2) is one such and works as an important cofactor for MYC-dependent transcription. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ATAD2 has been identified as a candidate driver gene located within the amplified 8q24 locus. However, the prognostic significance of ATAD2 protein expression in HCC remains uncertain. We investigated ATAD2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue from 182 HCC patients who underwent curative resection. Associations of ATAD2 expression with clinicopathologic variables or prognosis of HCC patients were analyzed. ATAD2 expression was observed in 119 (65.4%) of the 182 HCCs and tended to be independent predictor of early recurrence (p=0.059). ATAD2 expression showed an unfavorable influence on recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p &lt; 0.001).

In addition, ATAD2 expression was an independent predictor of shorter RFS (p=0.002). ATAD2 expression showed an unfavorable influence on disease-specific survival (p=0.001), but was not an independent predictor of shorter disease-specific survival (p=0.109).

25406467,ATAD2,10.1534/genetics.114.168039,Maintenance of nucleosomal balance in cis by conserved AAA-ATPase Yta7.,"The extent of chromatin compaction is a fundamental driver of nuclear metabolism . Yta7 is a chromatin-associated AAA-ATPase, the human ortholog of which, ANCCA/ATAD2 transcriptionally activates pathways of malignancy in a broad range of cancers. Yta7 directly binds histone H3, and bulk chromatin exhibits increased nucleosomal density in yta7&#x394; mutants. The suppression of yta7&#x394; mutant growth and transcriptional phenotypes in budding yeast by decreased dosage of histones H3 and H4 indicates the acute sensitivity of cells to deviations in nucleosome spacing. This study investigated the global changes in chromatin structure upon Yta7 loss or overexpression and determined which of these effects reflected direct Yta7 activity. Metagene analysis of Yta7's genome-wide localization indicated peak binding of Yta7 just downstream of the transcription start site. Cells lacking Yta7 exhibited increased nucleosome density within genes downstream of the +1 nucleosome, as defined by decreased internucleosomal distance, resulting in progressively 5'-shifted nucleosomes within the gene. In contrast, cells overexpressing Yta7 displayed profound 3'-shifts in nucleosome position and reduced nucleosome density within genes. Importantly, Yta7-bound regions were enriched for nucleosomal shifts, indicating that Yta7 acted locally to modulate nucleosome spacing. The phenotype of cells lacking both Yta7 and Rtt106, the histone H3/H4 chaperone, indicated that Yta7 functions in both Rtt106-dependent and Rtt106-independent ways to modulate nucleosome spacing within genes. This study suggested that Yta7 affected nucleosome density throughout the gene by both blocking Rtt106 from entering the gene, as shown previously at HTA1, and facilitating the loss of nucleosomes from the 5'-end.",2015,"ANCCA; ATAD2; Rtt106; Yta7; nucleosome positioning; Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone; Conserved Sequence; Molecular Chaperones; Nucleosomes; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",10

One such factor appears to be ATAD2, a remarkably conserved protein normally predominantly expressed in germ cells but almost systematically over-expressed in a variety of unrelated cancers. The presence of a bromodomain adjacent to an AAA type ATPase domain, points to ATAD2 as a factor preliminarily acting on chromatin structure and function. Accordingly, ATAD2 has been shown to cooperate with a series of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers to regulate specific set of genes. Here we discuss our knowledge on ATAD2 to evaluate its role as a cancer driver and its value as a new anti-cancer target. Upon its activation, ATAD2 through its interaction with defined transcription factors, initiates a loop of transcriptional stimulation of target genes, including ATAD2 itself, leading to enhanced cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis in an ATAD2-dependent manner. Approaches aiming at neutralizing ATAD2 activity in cancer, including the use of small molecule inhibitors of its two ""druggable"" domains, AAA ATPase and bromodomain, could become part of a promising anti-cancer strategy.",2013,"Bromodomain inhibitor; Cancer testis; Germline; H4K5ac; Myc; ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities; Adenosine Triphosphatases; DNA-Binding Proteins; Epigenesis, Genetic; Genome, Human; Humans; Neoplasms",10

A recent study suggested that ANCCA was a likely driver whose expression explained the behavior of differentially expressed proliferation-related genes in lung adenocarcinoma. However, protein expression of ANCCA in lung adenocarcinoma and its association with clinicopathologic parameters and commonly reported driver mutations remains unexplored. ANCCA expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 143 surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas and was correlated with clinicopathologic and molecular variables including adenocarcinoma histologic subtypes, tumor, node, metastasis status, relapse-free survival, overall survival, EGFR mutations, KRAS mutations, HER2 mutations and ALK fusions. Positive ANCCA expression was significantly associated with male sex, smokers, poorly differentiated tumors, nonlepidic predominant subtype, more advanced T stage, lymph nodal metastasis and late disease stage. Cox multivariate analysis revealed that ANCCA-positive expression was an independent predictor of worse relapse-free survival [hazard ratio (HR) 1.736, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.075-2.804; P = .024) and overall survival (HR 7.758, 95 % CI 2.955-20.370; P &lt; .001). The addition of ANCCA protein expression to the prognostic model using pathologic stage markedly improved the prognostic accuracy; the concordance index increased from .692 to .788, and the Akaike information criterion decreased from 354.20 to 336.11.

We analyzed the copy number and gene expression profiles of lung adenocarcinomas in 165 patients and related the alterations to smoking status. Having found differences in the tumor profiles, we integrated copy number and gene expression data from 80 paired samples. Amplifications at 8q24.12 overlapping MYC and ATAD2 were more frequent in ever smokers. Unsupervised analysis of gene expression revealed two groups: in the group with mainly never smokers, the tumors expressed genes common to normal lung; in the group with more ever smokers, the tumors expressed ""proliferative"" and ""invasive"" gene clusters. Integration of copy number and gene expression data identified one module enriched in mitotic genes and MYC targets. Its main associated modulator was ATAD2, a cofactor of MYC. A strong dose-response relationship between ATAD2 and proliferation-related gene expression was noted in both never and ever smokers, which was verified in two independent cohorts. Both ATAD2 and MYC expression correlated with 8q24.12 amplification and were higher in ever smokers. However, only ATAD2, and not MYC, overexpression explained the behavior of proliferation-related genes and predicted a worse prognosis independently of disease stage in a large validation cohort.

It is located at 8q24 and frequently amplified in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of DSCC1 in the carcinogenesis and progress of HCC has not been fully investigated. Here, we aimed to assert the importance of DSCC1 in the HCC. In this study, copy number variation data and RNA sequencing data were used to calculate the DNA copy number and mRNA expression of DSCC1 in HCC. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry analysis were used to determine the mRNA and protein level of DSCC1 in HCC. The Kaplan-Meier analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to assess the association of DSCC1 with the overall survival (OS) of HCC patients. Moreover, lentiviral shRNA was used to knockdown DSCC1, and then, colony-forming assay, cell cycle assay, and cell proliferation assay were performed to evaluate the impact of DSCC1 silencing on HCC cell lines. We found that DSCC1 was amplified and highly expressed in HCC tumor tissues than in nontumor tissues. We then found that the overexpression of both mRNA and protein of DSCC1 was linked to the bad prognosis of HCC patients. Astonishingly, the protein level of DSCC1 was an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-2.74; P = 0.007). Furthermore, the clonogenic capacity of DSCC1-amplified HCC cell lines (MHCC-97H, MHCC-97L, and Hep3B) was significantly inhibited by transduction of a lentiviral shRNA that targets DSCC1. We also showed that knockdown of DSCC1 induced G0-G1 cell cycle arrest (increased from 60% to more than 80%) and greatly inhibited the proliferation of HCC cell lines. These results suggest that DSCC1 is a putative HCC driver gene that promotes proliferation and is associated with poor prognosis in HCC. <b>&#x539f;&#x53d1;&#x6027;&#x809d;&#x7ec6;&#x80de;&#x764c;&#x4e2d;&#x8fc7;&#x8868;&#x8fbe;</b><b>DSCC1</b><b>&#x4fc3;&#x8fdb;&#x589e;&#x6b96;&#x5e76;&#x4e0e;&#x4e0d;&#x826f;&#x9884;&#x540e;&#x76f8;&#x5173;</b> <b>&#x6458;&#x8981;</b> <b>&#x80cc;&#x666f;&#xff1a;</b>DSCC1&#xff08;&#x4e5f;&#x79f0;&#x4e3a;DCC1&#xff09;&#x662f;&#x5728;&#x7ec6;&#x80de;&#x5468;&#x671f;S&#x671f;&#x8d1f;&#x8f7d;&#x589e;&#x6b96;&#x7ec6;&#x80de;&#x6838;&#x6297;&#x539f;&#xff08;PCNA&#xff09;&#x5230;DNA&#x7684;&#x66ff;&#x4ee3;&#x590d;&#x5236;&#x56e0;&#x5b50;C&#xff08;RFC&#xff09;&#x7684;&#x7ec4;&#x6210;&#x90e8;&#x5206;&#x3002;&#x5b83;&#x6240;&#x5728;&#x7684;&#x67d3;&#x8272;&#x4f53;8q24&#x533a;&#x6bb5;&#x5728;&#x539f;&#x53d1;&#x6027;&#x809d;&#x7ec6;&#x80de;&#x764c;(HCC)&#x4e2d;&#x5b58;&#x5728;&#x9ad8;&#x9891;&#x7387;&#x7684;&#x6269;&#x589e;&#xff0c;&#x4f46;&#x662f;DSCC1&#x5728;HCC&#x53d1;&#x751f;&#x53d1;&#x5c55;&#x4e2d;&#x7684;&#x4f5c;&#x7528;&#x5c1a;&#x4e0d;&#x6e05;&#x695a;&#x3002; <b>&#x65b9;&#x6cd5;&#xff1a;</b>&#x5229;&#x7528;HCC&#x60a3;&#x8005;&#x7684;DNA&#x62f7;&#x8d1d;&#x6570;&#x53d8;&#x5f02;&#x6570;&#x636e;(CNV)&#x548c;&#x8f6c;&#x5f55;&#x7ec4;&#x6d4b;&#x5e8f;&#x6570;&#x636e;&#xff08;RNA-Seq&#xff09;&#xff0c;&#x5206;&#x6790;DSCC1&#x7684;&#x62f7;&#x8d1d;&#x6570;&#x53d8;&#x5f02;&#x548c;mRNA&#x8f6c;&#x5f55;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#xff1b;&#x4f7f;&#x7528;&#x8367;&#x5149;&#x5b9a;&#x91cf;PCR&#x548c;Western Blot&#x5206;&#x6790;&#x8be5;&#x57fa;&#x56e0;mRNA&#x548c;&#x7f16;&#x7801;&#x86cb;&#x767d;&#x7684;&#x8868;&#x8fbe;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#x3002;&#x8fdb;&#x4e00;&#x6b65;&#x4f7f;&#x7528;&#x6162;&#x75c5;&#x6bd2;shRNA&#x6572;&#x51cf;DSCC1&#x8fdb;&#x884c;&#x529f;&#x80fd;&#x5b66;&#x9a8c;&#x8bc1;&#xff0c;&#x5206;&#x6790;&#x6572;&#x51cf;DSCC1&#x5bf9;HCC&#x7ec6;&#x80de;&#x7cfb;&#x589e;&#x6b96;&#x548c;&#x514b;&#x9686;&#x5f62;&#x6210;&#x80fd;&#x529b;&#x7684;&#x5f71;&#x54cd;&#x3002; <b>&#x7ed3;&#x679c;&#xff1a;</b>&#x6211;&#x4eec;&#x53d1;&#x73b0;HCC&#x4e2d;DSCC1&#x7684;&#x62f7;&#x8d1d;&#x6570;&#x663e;&#x8457;&#x6269;&#x589e;&#x3001;mRNA&#x8f6c;&#x5f55;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#x663e;&#x8457;&#x5347;&#x9ad8;&#xff1b;&#x5e76;&#x4e14;&#x5176;mRNA&#x548c;&#x86cb;&#x767d;&#x7684;&#x8868;&#x8fbe;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#x4e0e;&#x60a3;&#x8005;&#x7684;&#x4e0d;&#x826f;&#x9884;&#x540e;&#x663e;&#x8457;&#x76f8;&#x5173;&#x3002;&#x66f4;&#x91cd;&#x8981;&#x7684;&#x662f;&#xff0c;&#x6211;&#x4eec;&#x53d1;&#x73b0;&#x4f7f;&#x7528;shRNA&#x6572;&#x51cf;&#x90e8;&#x5206;HCC&#x7ec6;&#x80de;&#x7cfb;&#xff08;Hep3B&#xff0c;MHCC97H&#x548c;MHCC97L&#xff09;&#x7684;DSCC1&#x80fd;&#x663e;&#x8457;&#x6291;&#x5236;&#x5176;&#x514b;&#x9686;&#x5f62;&#x6210;&#x80fd;&#x529b;&#x548c;&#x589e;&#x6b96;&#x80fd;&#x529b;&#x90e8;&#x5206;&#xff0c;&#x4e14;&#x8fd9;&#x4e9b;&#x7ec6;&#x80de;&#x7cfb;&#x5747;&#x5b58;&#x5728;DSCC1&#x57fa;&#x56e0;&#x533a;&#x6bb5;&#x7684;&#x6269;&#x589e;&#x3002;&#x6700;&#x540e;&#xff0c;&#x6211;&#x4eec;&#x8fd8;&#x53d1;&#x73b0;&#x6572;&#x51cf;DSCC1&#x80fd;&#x591f;&#x4f7f;HCC&#x7ec6;&#x80de;&#x505c;&#x6ede;&#x4e8e;G0/G1&#x671f;&#x548c;&#x5e76;&#x663e;&#x8457;&#x5730;&#x6291;&#x5236;&#x7ec6;&#x80de;&#x589e;&#x6b96;&#x3002; <b>&#x7ed3;&#x8bba;&#xff1a;</b> DSCC1&#x662f;&#x4e00;&#x4e2a;&#x6f5c;&#x5728;&#x7684;&#x539f;&#x53d1;&#x6027;&#x809d;&#x7ec6;&#x80de;&#x764c;&#x9a71;&#x52a8;&#x57fa;&#x56e0;&#xff0c;&#x5176;&#x8fc7;&#x8868;&#x8fbe;&#x80fd;&#x4fc3;&#x8fdb;&#x589e;&#x6b96;&#x5e76;&#x4e0e;HCC&#x60a3;&#x8005;&#x7684;&#x4e0d;&#x826f;&#x9884;&#x540e;&#x76f8;&#x5173;&#x3002;.",2019,"Cell Cycle; Cell Proliferation; DNA Replication and Sister Chromatid Cohesion 1; Hepatocellular Carcinoma; Blotting, Western; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; DNA Replication; Female; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Proportional Hazards Models; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction",1

In a previous study, we identified 51 putative cancer genes over-expressed in MPM tissues and cell lines. Here, we deepened the study on nine of them (<i>ASS1</i>, <i>EIF4G1</i>, <i>GALNT7</i>, <i>GLUT1</i>, <i>IGF2BP3</i> (<i>IMP3</i>), <i>ITGA4</i>, <i>RAN</i>, <i>SOD1</i>, and <i>THBS2</i>) to ascertain whether they are truly mesothelial cancer driver genes (CDGs) or genes overexpressed in an adaptive response to the tumoral progression (""passenger genes""). Through a fast siRNA-based screening, we evaluated the consequences of gene depletion on migration, proliferation, colony formation capabilities, and caspase activities of four MPM (Mero-14, Mero-25, IST-Mes2, and NCI-H28) and one SV40-immortalized mesothelial cell line (MeT-5A) as a non-malignant model. The depletion of <i>EIF4G1</i> and <i>RAN</i> significantly reduced cell proliferation and colony formation and increased caspase activity. In particular, the findings for RAN resemble those observed for other types of cancer. Thus, we evaluated the in vitro effects of importazole (IPZ), a small molecule inhibitor of the interaction between RAN and importin-&#x3b2;. We showed that IPZ could have effects similar to those observed following <i>RAN</i> gene silencing. We also found that primary cell lines from one out of three MPM patients were sensitive to IPZ. As <i>EIF4G1</i> and <i>RAN</i> deserve further investigation with additional in vitro and in vivo studies, they emerged as promising CDGs, suggesting that their upregulation could play a role in mesothelial tumorigenesis and aggressiveness. Furthermore, present data propose the molecular pathways dependent on RAN as a putative pharmacological target for MPM patients in the view of a future personalized medicine.",2021,"EIF4G1; MPM; RAN; cancer driving gene; importazole; siRNA; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Epithelium; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Mesothelioma, Malignant; Pleural Neoplasms; Quinazolines; RNA, Small Interfering; Small Molecule Libraries; beta Karyopherins; ran GTP-Binding Protein",1

33042625,TRIP13,,TRIP13 predicts poor prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,"What is the leading molecular mechanism that causes broad resistance to systemic therapies remains a key question in renal cancer related research. We explored associations of TRIP13 expression with the clinical course using the tissue microarray (TMA). The TMA contained specimens from 87 patients diagnosed with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). We performed immunohistochemistry to investigate TRIP13 protein expression levels. The overall survival (OS) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank statistics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazard models. Median follow up for the TMA cohort was 7.0 years. Tissues from 28.74% of patients demonstrated high TRIP13 expression. Mean TRIP13 expression in TRIP13-rich tumors was significantly higher comparing to adjacent normal tissues (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). TRIP13 expression did not significantly correlate with stage nor tumor grade (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). Elevated expression of TRIP13 served as an independent unfavorable prognostic indicator of survival in ccRCC (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). TRIP13 overexpression predicts poor prognosis in ccRCC. Together with the emerging reports, this observation raises a suspicion that TRIP13 is a substantial driver of resistance to systemic therapies against kidney cancer.",2020,OS; TRIP13; ccRCC; expression; kidney cancer; prognosis; renal carcinoma; survival,3

However, MHT therapies were controversial with the increased risk of breast cancer because of different estrogen and progestogen combinations, and the molecular basis behind this phenomenon is currently not understood. To address this issue, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the estrogen plus progestogens treatment (EPT) and estrogen treatment (ET) using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. As a result, a total of 96 upregulated DEGs were first identified. Seven DEGs related to the cell cycle (CCNE2, CDCA5, RAD51, TCF19, KNTC1, MCM10, and NEIL3) were validated by RT-qPCR. Specifically, these seven DEGs were increased in EPT compared to ET (p &lt; 0.05) and had higher expression levels in breast cancer than adjacent normal tissues (p &lt; 0.05). Next, we found that estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients with a higher CNNE2 expression have a shorter overall survival time (p &lt; 0.05), while this effect was not observed in the other six DEGs (p &gt; 0.05). Interestingly, the molecular docking results showed that CCNE2 might bind to 17&#x3b2;-estradiol (&#x2212;6.791 kcal/mol), progesterone (&#x2212;6.847 kcal/mol), and medroxyprogesterone acetate (&#x2212;6.314 kcal/mol) with a relatively strong binding affinity, respectively. Importantly, CNNE2 protein level could be upregulated with EPT and attenuated by estrogen receptor antagonist, acolbifene and had interactions with cancer driver genes (AKT1 and KRAS) and high mutation frequency gene (TP53 and PTEN) in breast cancer patients. In conclusion, the current study showed that CCNE2, CDCA5, RAD51, TCF19, KNTC1, MCM10, and NEIL3 might contribute to EPT-related tumorigenesis in breast cancer, with CCNE2 might be a sensitive risk indicator of breast cancer risk in women using MHT.",2022,"bioinformatic analysis; breast cancer; estrogen plus progestogens treatment; menopausal hormone therapy; Breast Neoplasms; Computational Biology; Estradiol; Estrogen Receptor Antagonists; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Estrogens; Female; Humans; Medroxyprogesterone Acetate; Menopause; Molecular Docking Simulation; Progesterone; Progestins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Receptors, Estrogen; Transcription Factors",4
32823571,CCNE2,10.3390/cancers12082268,Cyclin E2 Promotes Whole Genome Doubling in Breast Cancer.,"Genome doubling is an underlying cause of cancer cell aneuploidy and genomic instability, but few drivers have been identified for this process. Due to their physiological roles in the genome reduplication of normal cells, we hypothesised that the oncogenes cyclins E1 and E2 may be drivers of genome doubling in cancer. We show that both cyclin E1 (<i>CCNE1</i>) and cyclin E2 (<i>CCNE2</i>) mRNA are significantly associated with high genome ploidy in breast cancers. By live cell imaging and flow cytometry, we show that cyclin E2 overexpression promotes aberrant mitosis without causing mitotic slippage, and it increases ploidy with negative feedback on the replication licensing protein, Cdt1. We demonstrate that cyclin E2 localises with core preRC (pre-replication complex) proteins (MCM2, MCM7) on the chromatin of cancer cells. Low <i>CCNE2</i> is associated with improved overall survival in breast cancers, and we demonstrate that low cyclin E2 protects from excess genome rereplication. This occurs regardless of p53 status, consistent with the association of high cyclin E2 with genome doubling in both p53 null/mutant and p53 wildtype cancers. In contrast, while cyclin E1 can localise to the preRC, its downregulation does not prevent rereplication, and overexpression promotes polyploidy via mitotic slippage. Thus, in breast cancer, cyclin E2 has a strong association with genome doubling, and likely contributes to highly proliferative and genomically unstable breast cancers.",2020,cyclin E1; cyclin E2; genome doubling; genomic instability; p53,4

To identify MPNST driver genes, we performed a lentiviral short hairpin (sh) RNA screen, targeting all 130 genes up-regulated in neurofibroma and MPNSTs versus normal human nerve Schwann cells. NF1 mutant cells show activation of RAS/MAPK signaling, so a counter-screen in RAS mutant carcinoma cells was performed to exclude common RAS-pathway driven genes. We identified 7 genes specific for survival of MPSNT cells, including MEIS1. MEIS1 was frequently amplified or hypomethylated in human MPSNTs, correlating with elevated MEIS1 gene expression. In MPNST cells and in a genetically engineered mouse model, MEIS1 expression in developing nerve glial cells was necessary for MPNST growth.

35117330,ABCA6,10.21037/tcr-20-3177,Analyzing the key gene expression and prognostics values for acute myeloid leukemia.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the first tumor types sequenced at the whole genome level. However, numbers of the mutated genes expression levels, functions, and prognostics values still unclear. To most ordinary mutated genes were analyzed via cancer virtual cohort discovery analysis platform (CVCDAP), and further investigated the mutational conversions, variant allele frequencies (VAF), driver genes, and potential druggable mutated genes in AML. The top mutated gene mRNA expression levels and the relationship between gene expression levels and prognosis for AML patients were performed by Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). Moreover, we used the UALCAN dataset to confirm the association between gene expression levels and prognosis for AML patients. Enrichment functions of the top mutated genes of AML were analyzed through Metascape. Finally, the role of these defined genes in cancer pathways and potential drug targets were analyzed by gene set cancer analysis (GSCALite). The top 20 mutated genes for AML included <i>FLT3</i>, <i>HPS3</i>, <i>ABCA6</i>, <i>PCLO</i>, <i>SLIT2</i>, and other ones. Compared to normal control samples, NPM1 and GABRB3 were significantly downregulated in AML samples, but TP53, DNMT3A, HPS3, FLT3, SENP6, and RUNX1 were significantly overexpressed (all these genes P value &lt;0.01). Overexpression of FLT3 and PCLO indicated a poor prognosis, but the overexpression of SLIT3 functioned as a protector for AML via GEPIA. HSP3 indicates the favorable factor for AML, but overexpression of ABCA6 (P=0.066) may act as the adverse factor by UALCAN analysis. Enrichment function analysis shows the functions of defining genes, including negative regulation of cell differentiation, small GTPase mediated signal transduction, and immune system process. Finally, these genes participate in apoptosis, cell cycle, PI3K/AKT, and RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, and FLT3 is sensitive to 5-Fluorouracil, Methotrexate, ATRA.

Herein, our study aimed to identify significant genes with poor outcome and underlying mechanisms in NSCLC using bioinformatics analyses. Gene expression profiles (GSE33532, GSE19188, GSE102287, GSE27262), including 319 NSCLC and 232 adjacent lung tissues, were downloaded from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the GEO2R online tool. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed via the DAVID database. The protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of these DEGs were constructed by the STRING website and visualized by the Cytoscape software platform. The expression of hub genes in NSCLC was validated through the GEPIA database. Kaplan-Meier plotter was used to analyse the survival rate with multivariate Cox regression. The expression of protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2) in NSCLC and adjacent lung tissues was evaluated on the UALCAN database platform. A total of 225 significant DEGs were obtained between NSCLC and adjacent lung tissues, containing 52 upregulated genes and 173 downregulated genes. The DEGs were clustered based on functions and signaling pathways that may be closely associated with NSCLC occurrence. A total of 174 DEGs were identified from the PPI network complex. Top 10 hub genes were selected by CytoHubba plugin. As independent predictors, seven genes (<i>COL1A1, ADAM12, VWF, OGN, EDN1, CAV1, ITGA8</i>) were associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC via multivariate Cox regression (P&lt;0.01). Four genes (<i>VWF, CAV1, ITGA8, COL1A1</i>) were found to be significantly enriched in the focal adhesion pathway (P=1.04E-04) and to be upstream regulators of PTK2. PTK2 was upregulated in NSCLC and associated with poor survival prognosis in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Taken together, the important genes and pathways in NSCLC were identified by using integrated bioinformatics analysis. PTK2 could be a key gene associated with the biological process of NSCLC formation and progression and a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment.",2022,Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); bioinformatics; differentially expressed genes (DEGs),4

Its expression, potential functions and underlying mechanisms in pancreatic cancer are studied. Bioinformatics studies and results from local human tissues show that NSD3 is upregulated in human pancreatic cancer tissues, which is correlated with poor overall survival. In primary and established pancreatic cancer cells, NSD3 silencing (by shRNAs) or CRISPR/Cas9-induced NSD3 knockout potently inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while provoking cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Conversely, ectopic expression of NSD3-T1232A mutation significantly accelerated proliferation, migration, and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. H3K36 dimethylation, expression of NSD3-dependent genes (Prkaa2, Myc, Irgm1, Adam12, and Notch3), and mTOR activation (S6K1 phosphorylation) were largely inhibited by NSD3 silencing or knockout. In vivo, intratumoral injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-packed NSD3 shRNA potently inhibited pancreatic cancer xenograft growth in nude mice. These results suggest that elevated NSD3 could be an important driver for the malignant progression of pancreatic cancer.",2022,"Animals; Apoptosis; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Cohort Studies; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Histones; Humans; Methylation; Mice, Nude; Mutation; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Nuclear Proteins; Pancreatic Neoplasms; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Small Interfering; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",4

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are known to contribute to poor outcome by conferring therapy resistance to various cancer types, but this has not been explored in EAC. Importantly, a targeted strategy to circumvent CAF-induced resistance has yet to be identified. By using EAC patient-derived CAFs, organoid cultures, and xenograft models we identified IL-6 as the stromal driver of therapy resistance in EAC. IL-6 activated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, which was accompanied by enhanced treatment resistance, migratory capacity, and clonogenicity. Inhibition of IL-6 restored drug sensitivity in patient-derived organoid cultures and cell lines. Analysis of patient gene expression profiles identified ADAM12 as a noninflammation-related serum-borne marker for IL-6-producing CAFs, and serum levels of this marker predicted unfavorable responses to neoadjuvant chemoradiation in EAC patients. These results demonstrate a stromal contribution to therapy resistance in EAC. This signaling can be targeted to resensitize EAC to therapy, and its activity can be measured using serum-borne markers.",2019,"IL-6; epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; esophageal adenocarcinoma; therapy resistance; tumor stroma; Adenocarcinoma; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Disease Models, Animal; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Esophageal Neoplasms; Humans; Interleukin-6; Mice; Radiation Tolerance; Stromal Cells; Tissue Culture Techniques; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",4
22662180,ADAM12,10.1371/journal.pone.0037628,Functional analysis of a breast cancer-associated mutation in the intracellular domain of the metalloprotease ADAM12.,"A recently identified breast cancer-associated mutation in the metalloprotease ADAM12 alters a potential dileucine trafficking signal, which could affect protein processing and cellular localization. ADAM12 belongs to the group of A Disintegrin And Metalloproteases (ADAMs), which are typically membrane-associated proteins involved in ectodomain shedding, cell-adhesion, and signaling. ADAM12 as well as several members of the ADAM family are over-expressed in various cancers, correlating with disease stage. Three breast cancer-associated somatic mutations were previously identified in ADAM12, and two of these, one in the metalloprotease domain and another in the disintegrin domain, were investigated and found to result in protein misfolding, retention in the secretory pathway, and failure of zymogen maturation. The third mutation, p.L792F in the ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail, was not investigated, but is potentially significant given its location within a di-leucine motif, which is recognized as a potential cellular trafficking signal. The present study was motivated both by the potential relevance of this documented mutation to cancer, as well as for determining the role of the di-leucine motif in ADAM12 trafficking. Expression of ADAM12 p.L792F in mammalian cells demonstrated quantitatively similar expression levels and zymogen maturation as wild-type (WT) ADAM12, as well as comparable cellular localizations. A cell surface biotinylation assay demonstrated that cell surface levels of ADAM12 WT and ADAM12 p.L792F were similar and that internalization of the mutant occurred at the same rate and extent as for ADAM12 WT. Moreover, functional analysis revealed no differences in cell proliferation or ectodomain shedding of epidermal growth factor (EGF), a known ADAM12 substrate between WT and mutant ADAM12. These data suggest that the ADAM12 p.L792F mutation is unlikely to be a driver (cancer causing)-mutation in breast cancer.",2012,"ADAM Proteins; ADAM12 Protein; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Membrane; Cell Proliferation; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Mutation; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Protein Transport; Proteolysis",4

It is through the filter of the blood-brain barrier that the brain responds to outside influences, and the blood-brain barrier is a critical point of failure in neuroinflammation. It is important to note that this interaction is not a static response, but one that evolves over time. While current models have provided invaluable information regarding the interaction between cytokine stimulation, the blood-brain barrier, and the brain, these approaches-whether in vivo or in vitro-have often been only snapshots of this complex web of interactions. We utilize new advances in microfluidics, organs-on-chips, and metabolomics to examine the complex relationship of inflammation and its effects on blood-brain barrier function ex vivo and the metabolic consequences of these responses and repair mechanisms. In this study, we pair a novel dual-chamber, organ-on-chip microfluidic device, the NeuroVascular Unit, with small-volume cytokine detection and mass spectrometry analysis to investigate how the blood-brain barrier responds to two different but overlapping drivers of neuroinflammation, lipopolysaccharide and a cytokine cocktail of IL-1&#x3b2;, TNF-&#x3b1;, and MCP1,2. In this study, we show that (1) during initial exposure to lipopolysaccharide, the blood-brain barrier is compromised as expected, with increased diffusion and reduced presence of tight junctions, but that over time, the barrier is capable of at least partial recovery; (2) a cytokine cocktail also contributes to a loss of barrier function; (3) from this time-dependent cytokine activation, metabolic signature profiles can be obtained for both the brain and vascular sides of the blood-brain barrier model; and (4) collectively, we can use metabolite analysis to identify critical pathways in inflammatory response. Taken together, these findings present new data that allow us to study the initial effects of inflammatory stimulation on blood-brain barrier disruption, cytokine activation, and metabolic pathway changes that drive the response and recovery of the barrier during continued inflammatory exposure.",2017,"Brain-on-chip; Cytokine; IL-1&#x3b2;; Lipopolysaccharide; MCP1,2; Mass spectrometry; Metabolomics; Micro-organ; TNF-&#x3b1;; Tight junctions; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain; Claudin-5; Cytokines; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Interleukin-1beta; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Lipopolysaccharides; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Models, Biological; Protein Transport; Tight Junctions; Time Factors; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Zonula Occludens-1 Protein",1
25855289,SLPI,10.1038/nature14403,A model of breast cancer heterogeneity reveals vascular mimicry as a driver of metastasis.,"Cancer metastasis requires that primary tumour cells evolve the capacity to intravasate into the lymphatic system or vasculature, and extravasate into and colonize secondary sites. Others have demonstrated that individual cells within complex populations show heterogeneity in their capacity to form secondary lesions. Here we develop a polyclonal mouse model of breast tumour heterogeneity, and show that distinct clones within a mixed population display specialization, for example, dominating the primary tumour, contributing to metastatic populations, or showing tropism for entering the lymphatic or vasculature systems. We correlate these stable properties to distinct gene expression profiles. Those clones that efficiently enter the vasculature express two secreted proteins, Serpine2 and Slpi, which were necessary and sufficient to program these cells for vascular mimicry. Our data indicate that these proteins not only drive the formation of extravascular networks but also ensure their perfusion by acting as anticoagulants. We propose that vascular mimicry drives the ability of some breast tumour cells to contribute to distant metastases while simultaneously satisfying a critical need of the primary tumour to be fed by the vasculature. Enforced expression of SERPINE2 and SLPI in human breast cancer cell lines also programmed them for vascular mimicry, and SERPINE2 and SLPI were overexpressed preferentially in human patients that had lung-metastatic relapse. Thus, these two secreted proteins, and the phenotype they promote, may be broadly relevant as drivers of metastatic progression in human cancer.",2015,"Animals; Anticoagulants; Breast Neoplasms; Clone Cells; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Progression; Endothelium, Vascular; Extracellular Matrix; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Neoplasm Metastasis; Recurrence; Secretory Leukocyte Peptidase Inhibitor; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Serpin E2",1

However, identifying a key driver gene or mutation that can be used for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment remains difficult. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing on genomic DNA obtained from six pairs of HCC and adjacent tissues and identified two novel somatic mutations of UBE2S (p. Gly57Ala and p. Lys63Asn). Predictions of the functional effects of the mutations showed that two amino-acid substitutions were potentially deleterious. Further, we observed that wild-type UBE2S, especially in the nucleus, was significantly higher in HCC tissues than that in adjacent tissues and closely related to the clinicopathological features of patients with HCC. Functional assays revealed that overexpression of UBE2S promoted the proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and G1/S phase transition of HCC cells in vitro, and promoted the tumor growth significantly in vivo. Mechanistically, UBE2S interacted with TRIM28 in the nucleus, both together enhanced the ubiquitination of p27 to facilitate its degradation and cell cycle progression. Most importantly, the small-molecule cephalomannine was found by a luciferase-based sensitive high-throughput screen (HTS) to inhibit UBE2S expression and significantly attenuate HCC progression in vitro and in vivo, which may represent a promising strategy for HCC therapy.",2022,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Cycle; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Nucleus; Cell Proliferation; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen; Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28; Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes; Ubiquitination",1
37165191,TOPBP1,10.1038/s41586-023-05974-0,Mitotic clustering of pulverized chromosomes from micronuclei.,"Complex genome rearrangements can be generated by the catastrophic pulverization of missegregated chromosomes trapped within micronuclei through a process known as chromothripsis<sup>1-5</sup>. As each chromosome contains a single centromere, it remains unclear how acentric fragments derived from shattered chromosomes are inherited between daughter cells during mitosis<sup>6</sup>. Here we tracked micronucleated chromosomes with live-cell imaging and show that acentric fragments cluster in close spatial proximity throughout mitosis for asymmetric inheritance by a single daughter cell. Mechanistically, the CIP2A-TOPBP1 complex prematurely associates with DNA lesions within ruptured micronuclei during interphase, which poises pulverized chromosomes for clustering upon mitotic entry. Inactivation of CIP2A-TOPBP1 caused acentric fragments to disperse throughout the mitotic cytoplasm, stochastically partition into the nucleus of both daughter cells and aberrantly misaccumulate as cytoplasmic DNA. Mitotic clustering facilitates the reassembly of acentric fragments into rearranged chromosomes lacking the extensive DNA copy-number losses that are characteristic of canonical chromothripsis. Comprehensive analysis of pan-cancer genomes revealed clusters of DNA copy-number-neutral rearrangements-termed balanced chromothripsis-across diverse tumour types resulting in the acquisition of known cancer driver events. Thus, distinct patterns of chromothripsis can be explained by the spatial clustering of pulverized chromosomes from micronuclei.",2023,NA,4

However, the key molecular events and mechanisms mediating lymph node metastasis remain elusive. RNA sequencing was used to identify driver genes responsible for lymph node metastasis in four cases of gastric primary tumors, metastatic lesions of lymph nodes and matched normal gastric epithelial tissue. qRT-PCR and IHC were applied to examine RPRD1B expression. Metastatic functions were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RNA-seq was used to identify target genes. ChIP, EMSA and dual luciferase reporter assays were conducted to identify the binding sites of target genes. Co-IP, RIP, MeRIP, RNA-FISH and ubiquitin assays were applied to explore the underlying mechanisms. The top 8 target genes (RPRD1B, MAP4K4, MCM2, TOPBP1, FRMD8, KBTBD2, ADAM10 and CXCR4) that were significantly upregulated in metastatic lymph nodes of individuals with GC were screened. The transcriptional cofactor RPRD1B (regulation of nuclear pre-mRNA domain containing 1B) was selected for further characterization. The clinical analysis showed that RPRD1B was significantly overexpressed in metastatic lymph nodes and associated with poor outcomes in patients with GC. The Mettl3-induced m<sup>6</sup>A modification was involved in the upregulation of RPRD1B. Functionally, RPRD1B promoted lymph node metastasis capabilities in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies indicated that RPRD1B increased fatty acid uptake and synthesis by transcriptionally upregulating c-Jun/c-Fos and activating the c-Jun/c-Fos/SREBP1 axis. In addition, NEAT1 was upregulated significantly by c-Jun/c-Fos in RPRD1B-overexpressing cells. NEAT1, in turn, increased the stability of the RPRD1B mRNA by recruiting the m<sup>6</sup>A ""reader"" protein hnRNPA2B1 and reduced the degradation of the RPRD1B protein by inhibiting TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination. Notably, this functional circuitry was disrupted by an inhibitor of c-Jun/c-Fos/AP1 proteins (SR11302) and small interfering RNAs targeting NEAT1, leading to a preferential impairment of lymph node metastasis. Based on these findings, RPRD1B facilitated FA metabolism and assisted primary tumor implantation in lymph nodes via the c-Jun/c-Fos/SREBP1 axis, which was enhanced by a NEAT1-mediated positive feedback loop, serving as a potential therapeutic target for GC treatment.",2022,"Fatty acid metabolism, c-Jun/c-Fos/SREBP1 axis; Lymph node metastasis; NEAT1; RPRD1B; TRIM25; hnRNPA2B1; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Fatty Acids; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Lymphatic Metastasis; Methyltransferases; Neoplasm Proteins; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; RNA Precursors; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Messenger; Stomach Neoplasms; Ubiquitins",4
34145035,TOPBP1,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-3651,CIP2A Interacts with TopBP1 and Drives Basal-Like Breast Cancer Tumorigenesis.,"Basal-like breast cancers (BLBC) are characterized by defects in homologous recombination (HR), deficient mitotic checkpoint, and high-proliferation activity. Here, we discover CIP2A as a candidate driver of BLBC. CIP2A was essential for DNA damage-induced initiation of mouse BLBC-like mammary tumors and for survival of HR-defective BLBC cells. CIP2A was dispensable for normal mammary gland development and for unperturbed mitosis, but selectively essential for mitotic progression of DNA damaged cells. A direct interaction between CIP2A and a DNA repair scaffold protein TopBP1 was identified, and CIP2A inhibition resulted in enhanced DNA damage-induced TopBP1 and RAD51 recruitment to chromatin in mammary epithelial cells. In addition to its role in tumor initiation, and survival of BRCA-deficient cells, CIP2A also drove proliferative MYC and E2F1 signaling in basal-like triple-negative breast cancer (BL-TNBC) cells. Clinically, high CIP2A expression was associated with poor patient prognosis in BL-TNBCs but not in other breast cancer subtypes. Small-molecule reactivators of PP2A (SMAP) inhibited CIP2A transcription, phenocopied the CIP2A-deficient DNA damage response (DDR), and inhibited growth of patient-derived BLBC xenograft. In summary, these results demonstrate that CIP2A directly interacts with TopBP1 and coordinates DNA damage-induced mitotic checkpoint and proliferation, thereby driving BLBC initiation and progression. SMAPs could serve as a surrogate therapeutic strategy to inhibit the oncogenic activity of CIP2A in BLBCs.

ChIP-PCR assay revealed that N-MYC transcriptionally activates PARP1, PARP2, BRCA1, RMI2, and TOPBP1 through binding to the promoters of these genes. MYCN or PARP1 gene knockdown significantly reduced the expression of MYCN-PARP-DDR pathway genes and NED markers, and inhibition with MYCNsi and/or PARPsi, BRCA1si, or RMI2si significantly suppressed malignant activities, including cell viability, colony formation, and cell migration, in C4-2b4 and NCI-H660 cells. Targeting this pathway with AURKA inhibitor PHA739358 and PARP inhibitor olaparib generated therapeutic effects similar to those of gene knockdown <i>in vitro</i> and significantly suppressed tumor growth in both C4-2b4 and MDACC PDX144-13C subcutaneous models <i>in vivo</i><b>Conclusions:</b> Our results identify a novel MYCN-PARP-DDR pathway that is driven by N-MYC in a subset of CRPC-Adeno and in NEPC.

Although many studies have investigated genomic alterations, the genomic landscape of Japanese PC patients has not been fully elucidated. We used whole-exome sequencing, cancer gene panel deep-sequencing, and microarray gene expression profiling data derived from the Japanese version of the Cancer Genome Atlas (JCGA) in 93 PC cases. Somatic driver mutations were identified in 65.6% of samples in 19 genes. The median tumor mutation burden (TMB) value was 0.24 Muts/Mb (interquartile range, 0.15-0.64 Muts/Mb). The commonly mutated genes were <i>KRAS</i> (58%), <i>TP53</i> (40%), <i>CDKN2A</i> (10%), SMAD4 (10%), <i>FGFR2</i> (9%), and <i>PKHD1</i> (9%). Frequent germline variation genes were <i>BRCA1</i> (8%), <i>CDH1</i> (5%), <i>MET</i> (5%), <i>MSH6</i> (5%), and <i>TEK</i> (5%). Frequent chromosomal arm alterations included copy number gains in 2q (42%), 7q (24%), and 3q (24%), and copy number losses in 19p (62%), 19q (47%), 12q (34%), and 7q (30%).

Patients with endometrial or ovarian carcinosarcomas who underwent clinical tumor-normal sequencing from 1/1/2015 to 6/1/2021 and consented to germline assessment of &#x2265;76 cancer predisposition genes were included. In patients with gPVs, biallelic inactivation was identified through analysis of loss of heterozygosity and somatic pathogenic alterations. Of 216 patients identified, 167 (77%) were diagnosed with endometrial carcinosarcoma and 49 (23%) with ovarian carcinosarcoma. Overall, 33 gPVs were observed in 29 patients (13%); 20 gPVs (61%) had biallelic loss in tumors. The rate of high-penetrance gPVs overall was 7% (16 of 216); 88% of high-penetrance gPVs had biallelic loss. In the endometrial carcinosarcoma cohort, 22 gPVs were found in 19 (11%) of 167 patients; 12 gPVs (55%) had biallelic loss in tumors, including 8 (89%) of 9 in high-penetrance gPVs. Among the ovarian carcinosarcoma cohort, 11 gPVs were found in 10 (20%) of 49 patients; 8 gPVs (73%) had biallelic loss in tumors, and all evaluable high-penetrance gPVs (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;6) had biallelic loss. All gPVs in homologous recombination (BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C) and Lynch syndrome (MSH2, MSH6) genes had biallelic loss in tumors (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;15). gPVs in genes affecting homologous recombination- or Lynch-associated mismatch repair exhibited biallelic inactivation within tumors, suggesting likely drivers of gynecologic carcinosarcoma.

Although previous algorithms have been successful in defining some CISs, they also miss CISs in certa<i>in situ</i>ations. A major common characteristic of these previous methods is that they do not take tumor heterogeneity into account. However, intertumoral heterogeneity directly influences the sequence read number for different tumor samples and then affects CIS identification. To precisely detect and define cancer driver genes, we developed SB Digestor, a computational algorithm that overcomes biological heterogeneity to identify more potential driver genes. Specifically, we define the relationship between the sequenced read number and putative gene number to deduce the depth cutoff for each tumor, which can reduce tumor complexity and precisely reflect intertumoral heterogeneity. Using this new tool, we re-analyzed our previously published SB-based screening dataset and identified many additional potent drivers involved in Brca1-related tumorigenesis, including Arhgap42, Tcf12, and Fgfr2.

PARP inhibitors (PARPi's) have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with germline (g)BRCA1/2, somatic (s)BRCA1/2, and gPALB2 mutations in clinical trials. However, patients with a poor performance status (PS) and those with severe organ impairment are often excluded from clinical trials and cancer-directed treatment. We report the cases of two patients&#xa0;with metastatic breast cancer who had poor PS, significant visceral disease, and gPALB2 and sBRCA mutations, who derived significant clinical benefit from treatment with PARP inhibition. Patient A had germline testing demonstrating a heterozygous PALB2 pathogenic mutation (c.3323delA) and a BRCA2 variant of unknown significance (c.9353T&gt;C), and tumor sequencing revealed PALB2 (c.228_229del and c.3323del) and ESR1 (c.1610A&gt;C) mutations.

The practice of precision therapy in pancreatic cancer was limited by the paucity of targetable genetic alterations, especially in the Asian population. To explore therapeutic targets in 499 Chinese PDAC patients, a deep sequencing panel (OncoPanscan&#x2122;, Genetron health) was used to characterize somatic alterations including point mutations, indels, copy number alterations, gene fusions as well as pathogenic germline variants. We performed genomic profiling in 499 Chinese PDAC patients, which revealed somatic driver mutations in KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, ARID1A, RNF43, and pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in cancer predisposition genes including BRCA2, PALB2, and ATM. Overall, 20.4% of patients had targetable genomic alterations. About 8.4% of patients carried inactivating germline and somatic variants in BRCA1/2 and PALB2, which were susceptible to platinum and PARP inhibitors therapy. Patients with KRAS wild-type disease and early-onset pancreatic cancer (EOPC) harbored actionable mutations including BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, and MAP2K1/2. Compared to PGV-negative patients, PGV-positive patients were younger and more likely to have a family history of cancer. Furthermore, PGVs in PALB2, BRCA2, and ATM were associated with high PDAC risk in the Chinese population. Our results demonstrated that a genetic screen of actionable genomic variants could facilitate precision therapy and cancer risk reduction in pancreatic cancer patients of Asian ethnicity.",2023,"cancer risk; genetic alterations; next-generation sequencing; pancreatic cancer; precision therapy; Humans; BRCA1 Protein; BRCA2 Protein; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; East Asian People; Genomics; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)",250

We analyzed nine ovarian and breast cancer patient derived xenografts (PDX) with <i>BRCA1</i> exon 11 frameshift mutations for splice isoform expression and therapy response. This included a matched PDX pair derived from a patient pre-and post-chemotherapy/PARPi regimen. <i>BRCA1</i> exon 11-deficient isoform expression was generally elevated in PARPi resistant PDX tumors. Two independent PDX models acquired secondary <i>BRCA1</i> splice site mutations (SSMs), predicted <i>in silico</i> to drive exon skipping. Predictions were confirmed using qRT-PCR, RNA sequencing, western blots and <i>BRCA1</i> minigene modelling.

Germline assessment of at least 76 cancer predisposition genes was performed in patients with EC undergoing clinical tumor-normal Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) sequencing from January 1, 2015, to June 30, 2021. In patients with gPVs, biallelic alterations in ECs were identified through analysis of loss of heterozygosity and somatic PVs. Clinicopathologic variables were compared using nonparametric tests. Of 1625 patients with EC, 216 (13%) had gPVs, and 15 patients had 2 gPVs. There were 231 gPVs in 35 genes (75 [32%] high penetrance; 39 [17%] moderate penetrance; and 117 [51%] low, recessive, or uncertain penetrance). Compared with those without gPVs, patients with gPVs were younger (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.002), more often White (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.009), and less obese (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.025) and had differences in distribution of tumor histology (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.017) and molecular subtype (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). Among 231 gPVs, 74 (32%) exhibited biallelic inactivation within tumors. For high-penetrance gPVs, 63% (47 of 75) of ECs had biallelic alterations, primarily affecting mismatch repair (MMR) and homologous recombination related genes, including BRCA1,BRCA2, RAD51D, and PALB2.

However, the molecular characteristics and main driver genes for SHC have not been determined. The aim of this study is to explore the potentially actionable mutations of driver genes, which may provide more therapeutic options for SHC. In this study, DNA extraction and library preparation were performed using tumor tissues from 28 SHC patients. Then we used Miseq platform (Illumina) to sequence the target-enriched library, and we aligned and processed the sequencing data. The gene groups were tested for SNVs/Indels/CNVs. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was assessed by the 425-cancer-relevant gene panel. Multivariate analysis of COX's model was used for survival analysis (OS) of patients' clinical characteristics. The median overall survival (OS) of the patients was only 4.4 months. <i>TP53</i>, <i>TERT</i>, and <i>KRAS</i> were the top three frequently mutated genes, with frequencies of 89.3%, 64.3%, and 21.4%, respectively. A considerable number of patients carried mutations in genes involved in the <i>TP53</i> pathway (96%) and DNA Damage Repair (DDR) pathway (21%). Multiple potentially actionable mutations, such as <i>NTRK1</i> fusions and <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations, were identified in SHCs. This study shows a landscape of gene mutations in SHC. SHC has high mutation rates in <i>TP53</i> pathway and DDR pathway. The potentially actionable mutations of driver genes may provide more therapeutic options for SHC.

However, our understanding of the mechanism of action of PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi) is still evolving. It is being increasingly appreciated that the immunomodulatory function of PARPi is a critical contributor of the anti-tumor effects of these compounds. Here, we identify a novel cell death effector pathway for PARPi where PARPi induces inflammatory pyroptosis that is mediated by caspase 3-dependent cleavage of GSDME. Caspase 3 is activated upon PARPi treatment which directly cleaves GSDME and, subsequently induces pyroptosis. Genetic and pharmacological experiments show that the presence of the PARP1 protein with uncompromised DNA binding capability is required for PARPi-induced pyroptosis, suggesting that PARP1 trapping is a key driver of this phenomenon. Importantly, we show that PARPi-induced GSDME cleavage and pyroptosis occurred only in the BRCA1-deficient cells, but not in those reconstituted with BRCA1 wild-type (WT). These findings suggest that pyroptosis could be a novel aspect of the immunomodulatory function of PARPi. Our studies could also offer new insights to the potential biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to achieve better anti-tumor effects of PARPi for BRCA-deficient tumors with low GSDME expression.",2023,BRCA gene; Caspase 3; Gasdermin E (GSDME); PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi); Poly-ADP-Ribose-polymerase 1 (PARP1); Pyroptosis; Humans; Pyroptosis; Gasdermins; Caspase 3; Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1; Cell Death; Neoplasms,250

These markers are determined depending on tumor stage, including sequencing techniques and immunohistochemical methods. This comprises the systematic investigation of molecular alterations such as PIK3CA or BRCA1,2 mutations, NTRK fusions, or microsatellite instability as a&#xa0;basis for targeted therapy. Further alterations, for example in the PI3K pathway, ESR1 alterations, or ERBB2 mutations, may also be relevant for individual therapy decisions especially in the context of resistant or relapsed disease. Thus, particularly in advanced stages, a&#xa0;more comprehensive molecular characterization of the tumor may reveal genetic alterations that act as tumor drivers and provide targets for personalized therapies. Due to the large number of potential molecular targets, NGS panel diagnostics are a&#xa0;suitable approach in this conjunction with immunohistochemical characterization and the individual clinical situation.

However, validated biomarkers that can be used to detect a response to platinum-based chemotherapy remain unavailable. Several studies have suggested that homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) may occur in response to platinum-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer and breast cancer. However, currently there is a lack of proven and reliable HRD markers that can be used to screen for patients who may benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy, especially in NSCLC. NGS was used to screen for gene mutations, including homologous recombination (HR) genes and common driver gene mutations in NSCLC. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify potential clinicopathological or gene mutation factors associated with survival in patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy, while Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log-rank test was performed to assess the effect of HR gene mutations on progression-free survival (PFS). In a retrospective cohort of 129 patients with advanced NSCLC, 54 who received platinum-based chemotherapy with or without anti-angiogenic therapy were included in the analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses showed that HR gene mutations were associated with platinum-based chemotherapy sensitivity. Efficacy results indicated that the objective response rates (ORR) for patients with <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations and <i>BRCA1/2</i> wild type were 75% and 30.4% (<i>p</i>=0.041), while the median PFS was 7.5 and 5.5 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.52; 95% CI, 0.27-1.00; <i>p=</i>0.084), respectively. The ORRs of patients with HR gene mutations and HR gene wild type were 60% and 23.6% (<i>p</i>=0.01), and the median PFS was 7.5 and 5.2 months (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32-0.97; <i>p=</i>0.033), respectively.

The accurate detection of somatic allelic imbalances (AIs) has been limited by methods focused on BRCA1/2 mutations and using mixtures of cancer types. Using pan-cancer data, we revealed distinct patterns of AIs in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC). We used machine learning and statistics to generate improved criteria to identify HRD in HGSC (ovaHRDscar). ovaHRDscar significantly predicted clinical outcomes in three independent patient cohorts with higher precision than previous methods. Characterization of 98 spatiotemporally distinct metastatic samples revealed low intra-patient variation and indicated the primary tumor as the preferred site for clinical sampling in HGSC. Further, our approach improved the prediction of clinical outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (tnbcHRDscar), validated in two independent patient cohorts.

We showed here that formaldehyde generated by serine/1-carbon cycle metabolism contributed to the accumulation of toxic DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) in leukemia cells, especially in driver clones harboring oncogenic tyrosine kinases (OTKs: FLT3(internal tandem duplication [ITD]), JAK2(V617F), BCR-ABL1). To counteract this effect, OTKs enhanced the expression of DNA polymerase theta (POL&#x3b8;) via ERK1/2 serine/threonine kinase-dependent inhibition of c-CBL E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitination of POL&#x3b8; and its proteasomal degradation. Overexpression of POL&#x3b8; in OTK-positive cells resulted in the efficient repair of DPC-containing DNA double-strand breaks by POL&#x3b8;-mediated end-joining. The transforming activities of OTKs and other leukemia-inducing oncogenes, especially of those causing the inhibition of BRCA1/2-mediated homologous recombination with and without concomitant inhibition of DNA-PK-dependent nonhomologous end-joining, was abrogated in Polq-/- murine bone marrow cells. Genetic and pharmacological targeting of POL&#x3b8; polymerase and helicase activities revealed that both activities are promising targets in leukemia cells. Moreover, OTK inhibitors or DPC-inducing drug etoposide enhanced the antileukemia effect of POL&#x3b8; inhibitor in&#xa0;vitro and in&#xa0;vivo. In conclusion, we demonstrated that POL&#x3b8; plays an essential role in protecting leukemia cells from metabolically induced toxic DNA lesions triggered by formaldehyde, and it can be targeted to achieve a therapeutic effect.",2023,Animals; Mice; BRCA1 Protein; BRCA2 Protein; DNA; DNA Damage; Leukemia,250

The dysfunctional DNA damage repair mechanism plays an essential role not only in the initiation and progression of hematological malignancies but also links to the development of TKI resistance. Deciphering the abnormally regulated DNA damage repair and proteins involved brings new insights into the therapy of leukemias. As a G2/M phase checkpoint kinase and a DNA damage repair checkpoint kinase engaged in the DNA damage response (DDR), along with an oncogenic driver present in various cancers, the particular involvement of Wee1 in DNA damage is far from clear. Deciphering its function and targeting it via modulating DNA repair pathways is important for improving our understanding of cancer treatment. Wee1 expression was assessed in cell lines using RT-qPCR and western blot, and Wee1 knockdown efficacy was validated using RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. Wee1 function was investigated by CCK-8, colony formation, and flow cytometry assay in vitro. Wee1 role in DNA repair and its interactions with other proteins were then studied using western blot, immunofluorescence, and double plasmid-repair studies. Finally, the CCK-8 and flow cytometry assay was utilized to investigate Wee1 and imatinib's synergistic effect, and a CML mouse model was constructed to study Wee1's role in carcinogenesis in vivo. Wee1 was reported to respond quickly to DDR in an ATM-&#x3b3;H2AX-MDC1-dependent way upon DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occurrence, and it regulated homologous recombination by stimulating the recruitment of critical proteins RAD51/BRCA1 upon DSB sites. Wee1 was also revealed to be abnormally upregulated in CML cells. Further suppression of Wee1 not only causes cell cycle arrest and inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells but also enhances CML cell sensitivity to Imatinib in vitro and in vivo, possibly through an excessive accumulation of overall DSBs. Wee1 is extensively involved in the DRR signaling and DSB repair pathway. Inhibiting abnormally elevated Wee1 benefits CML therapy in both IM-resistant and IM-sensitive cells. Our data demonstrated that Wee1 participated in promoting cell proliferation and imatinib resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia via regulating DNA damage repair dependent on ATM-&#x3b3;H2AX-MDC1. In the fight against CML, Wee1's dysregulation in the DNA damage repair mechanism of CML pathogenesis makes it a viable therapeutic target in clinical applications.",2023,"Chronic myeloid leukemia; DNA damage repair; DNA damage response; Wee1; Animals; Mice; Cell Proliferation; DNA Damage; DNA Repair; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Imatinib Mesylate; Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive; Sincalide; Humans",250

The DNA double strand break is one of the most severe form of damage and several redundant mechanisms have evolved to facilitate accurate repair. During DNA replication and in mitosis, breaks are primarily repaired by homologous recombination which is facilitated by several genes. Key to this process is the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 as well as the accessory RAD52 gene. Proper chromatin remodeling is also essential for repair and the KAT5 histone acetyltransferase facilitates histone removal at the break. Here we undertook a pan cancer analysis to investigate mutations within the KAT5 gene in cancer cells. We employed two standard artificial algorithms to classify mutations as either driver (CHASMPlus algorithm) or pathogenic (VEST4 algorithm). We find that most predicted driver and disease-causing mutations occur in the catalytic site or within key regulatory domains. <i>In silico</i> analysis of protein structure using AlphaFold shows that these mutations are likely to destabilize the function of KAT5 or interactions with DNA or its other partners. The data presented here, although preliminary, could be used to inform clinical strategies.",2022,NA,250

However, its rarity, paired with its genomic heterogeneity, challenges the development and evolution of targeted therapies. Interrogating large datasets drives better understanding of the characteristics of molecular subgroups of rare cancers and enables the identification of genomic patterns that remain unrecognized in smaller cohorts. We performed a retrospective analysis of 6,130 patients diagnosed with iCCA from the FoundationCORE database who received diagnostic panel sequencing on the FoundationOne platform. Short variants/fusion-rearrangements and copy number alterations in &gt;300 tumor-associated genes were evaluated, and the tumor mutational burden (TMB) as well as the microsatellite instability (MSI) status were available for the majority of the cohort. We provide a highly representative cartography of the genomic landscape of iCCA and outline the co-mutational spectra of seven therapeutically relevant oncogenic driver genes: IDH1/2, FGFR2, ERBB2, BRAF, MDM2, BRCA1/2, MET and KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>. We observed a negative selection of RTK/RAS/ERK pathway co-alterations, and an enrichment of epigenetic modifiers such as ARID1A and BAP1 in patients with IDH1/2 and FGFR2 alterations. RNF43 as well as KMT2D occurred with high frequency in MSI<sup>high</sup> and TMB<sup>high</sup> tumors. Detailed knowledge of the most prevalent genomic constellations is key to the development of effective treatment strategies for iCCA. Our study provides a valuable resource that could be used to assess the feasibility of clinical trials and subgroup analyses, spurs the development of translationally relevant preclinical models, and serves as a knowledge base to predict potential mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies in genomically defined subgroups. Due to the high frequency of targetable alterations, molecular diagnostics is recommended in patients with biliary tract cancers, and especially in those with iCCA. The identification of an actionable lesion, however, does not guarantee therapeutic success, and the co-mutational spectrum may act as a critical modifier of drug response. Using a large dataset of comprehensive panel sequencing results from 6,130 patients with iCCA, we provide a detailed analysis of the co-mutational spectrum of the most frequent druggable genetic alterations, which is meant to serve as a reference to establish genetically relevant preclinical models, develop hypothesis-driven combination therapies and identify recurrent genetic profiles.",2023,"biliary tract cancer; genomic alterations; immunotherapy; precision medicine; targeted therapy; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Precision Medicine; Cholangiocarcinoma; Mutation; Biomarkers, Tumor; Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic; Bile Duct Neoplasms",250

However, tumors evolve and evade therapeutic interventions often through the acquisition of&#xa0;genomic mutations. Here we examine patients profiled with tissue (TBx) and liquid biopsy (LBx) as part of routine clinical care, to characterize the tumor evolutionary landscape and identify potential vulnerabilities in the relapsed setting. Real-world evidence demonstrates that LBx is utilized later in care and identifies associations with intervening therapy. While driver events are frequently shared, acquired LBx alterations are detected in a majority of patients, with the highest frequency in ER+&#x2009;disease and in patients with longer biopsy intervals. Acquired mutations are often polyclonal and present at lower allelic&#xa0;fractions, suggesting multi-clonal convergent evolution. In addition to well-characterized resistance mutations (e.g., ESR1, NF1, RB1, ERBB2), we observe a diversity of rarer but potentially targetable mutations (e.g., PIK3CA, HRAS/NRAS/KRAS, FGFR1/2/3, BRAF) and fusions (e.g., FGFR1/2, ERBB2, RET), as well as BRCA1/2 reversions through a variety of mechanisms, including splice alterations and structural deletions.

NRP-1 up-regulation in ovarian cancer tissue predicts poor prognosis. However, the clinical relevance of the soluble form of NRP-1 (sNRP-1) as a circulating biomarker in ovarian cancer patients is unknown. sNRP-1 levels were quantified in a cohort of 88 clinically documented ovarian cancer patients by a commercially available sNRP-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Biomedica, Vienna, Austria). Patients (81.8% with FIGOIII/IV) received primary cytoreductive surgery with the aim of macroscopic complete resection (achieved in 55.7% of patients) and the recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy in line with national guidelines. Higher levels of sNRP-1 reflected more advanced disease (FIGO III/IV) and indicated a trend towards suboptimal surgical outcome, i.e. any residual tumor. sNRP-1 was neither related to the patients' age nor the <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutational status. Patients with higher sNRP-1 levels at primary diagnosis had a significantly reduced progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.541, 95%CI: 0.304 - 0.963; p = 0.037) and overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.459, 95%CI: 0.225 - 0.936; p = 0.032). Principal component analysis showed that sNRP-1 levels were unrelated to the circulating hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the soluble ectodomain of its receptor the tyrosine kinase mesenchymal-epithelial transition (c-MET), suggesting that there is no proportional serological concentration gradient of soluble components of the NRP-1/HGF/c-MET signaling axis. In line with the previously shown tissue-based prognostic role, we demonstrated for the first time that sNRP-1 can also act as a readily accessible, prognostic biomarker in the circulation of patients with ovarian cancer at primary diagnosis.

In this review, we briefly depict how these genes are involved in cancer, followed by a description of the most common techniques routinely applied for their analysis, including high-throughput next-generation sequencing technology and less expensive low-throughput options, such as real-time PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism, or high resolution melting analysis. We then introduce benefits of electrochemical biosensors as interesting alternatives to the standard methods in terms of cost, speed, and simplicity. We describe most common strategies involved in electrochemical biosensing of point mutations, relying mostly on PCR or isothermal amplification techniques, and critically discuss major challenges and obstacles that, until now, prevented their more widespread application in clinical settings.",2023,Biomarker; Cancer diagnostics; DNA point mutation; Electrochemical biosensor; Isothermal amplification; Single nucleotide variation; Humans; Point Mutation; Mutation; Neoplasms; DNA; Biosensing Techniques; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Genetic Predisposition to Disease,250

Therefore, this study aimed to delineate the novel molecular mechanisms by which tumour cells mechanoadapt to HG/HG-HO and whether phytochemical-based interference in these mechanisms can generate tumour-cell-selective vulnerability to cell death. Mannitol and L-glucose were used as hyper-osmotic equivalents of high glucose. The results revealed that the tumour cells can efficiently mechanoadapt to HG-HO only in the normoxic microenvironment. Under normoxic HG/HG-HO stress, tumour cells polySUMOylate a higher pool of mitotic driver pH3(Ser10), which translocates to the nucleus and promotes faster cell divisions. On the contrary, acute hypoxia dampens HG/HG-HO-associated excessive proliferation by upregulating sentrin protease SENP7. SENP7 promotes abnormal SUMOylation of pH3(Ser10), thereby restricting its nuclear entry and promoting the M-phase arrest and cell loss. However, the hypoxia-arrested cells that managed to survive showed relapse upon reversal to normoxia as well as upregulation of pro-survival-associated SENP1, and players in tumour growth signalling, autophagy, glycolytic pathways etc. Depletion of SENP1 in both normoxia and hypoxia caused significant loss of tumour cells vs undepleted controls. SENP1 was ascertained to restrict the abnormal SUMOylation of pH3(Ser10) in both normoxia and hypoxia, although not so efficiently in hypoxia, due to the opposing activity of SENP7. Co-treatment with Momordin Ic (MC), a natural SENP1 inhibitor, and Gallic Acid (GA), an inhibitor of identified major pro-tumourigenic signalling (both enriched in <i>Momordica charantia</i>), eliminated surviving tumour cells in normal glucose, HG and HG-HO normoxic and hypoxic microenvironments, suggesting that appropriate and enhanced polySUMOylation of pH3(Ser10) in response to HG/HG-HO stress was attenuated by this treatment along with further dampening of other key tumourigenic signalling, due to which tumour cells could no longer proliferate and grow.",2023,"SUMO2; high-glucose hyper-osmotic stress; mechanical force; natural product therapy; pH3(Ser10); tumour proliferation; Humans; Osmotic Pressure; Neoplasms; Glucose; Carcinogenesis; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Hypoxia; Oxygen; Tumor Microenvironment",1

Recent molecular characterization has defined new (epi)genetic drivers and potential targets for bladder cancer<sup>3,4</sup>. The immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown remarkable efficacy but only in a limited fraction of bladder cancer patients<sup>5-8</sup>. Here, we show that high G9a (EHMT2) expression is associated with poor clinical outcome in bladder cancer and that targeting G9a/DNMT methyltransferase activity with a novel inhibitor (CM-272) induces apoptosis and immunogenic cell death. Using an immunocompetent quadruple-knockout (Pten<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>; Trp53<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>; Rb1<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>; Rbl1<sup>-/-</sup>) transgenic mouse model of aggressive metastatic, muscle-invasive bladder cancer, we demonstrate that CM-272&#x2009;+&#x2009;cisplatin treatment results in statistically significant regression of established tumors and metastases. The antitumor effect is significantly improved when CM-272 is combined with anti-programmed cell death ligand 1, even in the absence of cisplatin. These effects are associated with an endogenous antitumor immune response and immunogenic cell death with the conversion of a cold immune tumor into a hot tumor. Finally, increased G9a expression was associated with resistance to programmed cell death protein 1 inhibition in a cohort of patients with bladder cancer. In summary, these findings support new and promising opportunities for the treatment of bladder cancer using a combination of epigenetic inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade.",2019,"Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cisplatin; Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein; Female; Histocompatibility Antigens; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Humans; Mice; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms",2

To identify contributory, secondary genetic alterations in these cancers, we used comprehensive genomics methods to compare 149 HPV-positive and 335 HPV-negative OSCC tumor/normal pairs. Different behavioral risk factors underlying the two OSCC types were reflected in distinctive genomic mutational signatures. In HPV-positive OSCCs, the signatures of APOBEC cytosine deaminase editing, associated with anti-viral immunity, were strongly linked to overall mutational burden. In contrast, in HPV-negative OSCCs, T&gt;C substitutions in the sequence context 5'-ATN-3' correlated with tobacco exposure. Universal expression of HPV <i>E6*1</i> and <i>E7</i> oncogenes was a sine qua non of HPV-positive OSCCs. Significant enrichment of somatic mutations was confirmed or newly identified in <i>PIK3CA</i>, <i>KMT2D</i>, <i>FGFR3</i>, <i>FBXW7</i>, <i>DDX3X</i>, <i>PTEN</i>, <i>TRAF3</i>, <i>RB1</i>, <i>CYLD</i>, <i>RIPK4</i>, <i>ZNF750</i>, <i>EP300</i>, <i>CASZ1</i>, <i>TAF5</i>, <i>RBL1</i>, <i>IFNGR1</i>, and <i>NFKBIA</i> Of these, many affect host pathways already targeted by HPV oncoproteins, including the p53 and pRB pathways, or disrupt host defenses against viral infections, including interferon (IFN) and nuclear factor kappa B signaling. Frequent copy number changes were associated with concordant changes in gene expression. Chr 11q (including <i>CCND1</i>) and 14q (including <i>DICER1</i> and <i>AKT1</i>) were recurrently lost in HPV-positive OSCCs, in contrast to their gains in HPV-negative OSCCs. High-ranking variant allele fractions implicated <i>ZNF750</i>, <i>PIK3CA</i>, and <i>EP300</i> mutations as candidate driver events in HPV-positive cancers. We conclude that virus-host interactions cooperatively shape the unique genetic features of these cancers, distinguishing them from their HPV-negative counterparts.",2019,"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Female; Humans; Male; Mouth Neoplasms; Mutation; Neoplasm Proteins; Oncogene Proteins, Viral; Papillomaviridae; Papillomavirus Infections",2

Here, utilizing the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) mass-spectrometry-based proteomics datasets, we defined differentially expressed proteins and mRNAs associated with higher grade or higher stage, for each of seven cancer types (breast, colon, lung adenocarcinoma, clear cell renal, ovarian, uterine, and pediatric glioma), representing 794 patients. Widespread differential patterns of total proteins and phosphoproteins involved some common patterns shared between different cancer types. More proteins were associated with higher grade than higher stage. Most proteomic signatures predicted patient survival in independent transcriptomic datasets. The proteomic grade signatures, in particular, involved DNA copy number alterations. Pathways of interest were enriched within the grade-associated proteins across multiple cancer types, including pathways of altered metabolism, Warburg-like effects, and translation factors. Proteomic grade correlations identified protein kinases having functional impact in vitro in uterine endometrial cancer cells, including MAP3K2, MASTL, and TTK. The protein-level grade and stage associations for all proteins profiled-along with corresponding information on phosphorylation, pathways, mRNA expression, and copy alterations-represent a resource for identifying new potential targets.

The reason for this very high level of unrepaired DNA lesions leading to these mutations is still poorly understood. The primary DNA repair mechanism for UV-induced lesions, that is, the nucleotide excision repair pathway, appears intact in most melanomas. We have previously reported a postreplication repair mechanism that is commonly defective in melanoma cell lines. Here we have used a genome-wide approach to identify the components of this postreplication repair mechanism. We have used differential transcript polysome loading to identify transcripts that are associated with UV response, and then functionally assessed these to identify novel components of this repair and cell cycle checkpoint network. We have identified multiple interaction nodes, including global genomic nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination repair, and previously unexpected MASTL pathway, as components of the response. Finally, we have used bioinformatics to assess the contribution of dysregulated expression of these pathways to the UV signature mutation load of a large melanoma cohort. We show that dysregulation of the pathway, especially the DNA damage repair components, are significant contributors to UV mutation load, and that dysregulation of the MASTL pathway appears to be a significant contributor to high UV signature mutation load.",2021,"DNA repair; G2 phase checkpoint; MASTL; postreplication repair; ultraviolet radiation; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA Repair; DNA Replication; G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Melanoma; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Mutation; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Phosphoproteins; Polyribosomes; Protein Phosphatase 2; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; RNA, Small Interfering; RNA-Seq; Recombinational DNA Repair; Ultraviolet Rays; Up-Regulation",2

However, the molecular link between hepatitis B virus and hepatocellular carcinoma is unknown. Thus, we aimed to elucidate molecular linkages underlying pathogenesis through in-depth data mining analysis. Differentially expressed genes were identified from patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, hepatocellular carcinoma, or both. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed signaling pathways involving differentially expressed genes. Protein-protein interaction networks, protein crosstalk, and enrichment were analyzed to determine whether differentially expressed gene products might serve as a bridge from hepatitis B virus infection to hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis. Prognostic potential and transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of bridge genes were also examined. We identified vital bridge factors in hepatitis B virus infection-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. Differentially expressed genes were clustered into modules based on relative protein function. Signaling pathways associated with cancer, inflammation, immune system, and microenvironment showed significant crosstalk between modules. Thirty-two genes were dysregulated in hepatitis B virus infection-mediated hepatocellular carcinoma. CPEB3, RAB26, SLCO1B1, ST3GAL6 and XK had higher connectivity in the modular network, suggesting significant associations with survival. CDC20 and NUP107 were identified as driver genes as well as markers of poor prognosis. Our results suggest that the sustained inflammatory environment created by hepatitis B virus infection is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma.

Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) is one of the most serious complications of HCC and is strongly correlated with a poor prognosis for HCC patients. However, the detailed mechanism of PVTT development remains to be explored. In this study, we present a large-scale transcriptome analysis, by RNA sequencing, of 11 patients diagnosed with HCC with PVTT. The dysregulated genes between HCC and PVTT suggested that the extracellular matrix receptor interaction was correlated with the venous metastases of HCC. Among all of the recurrent alternative splicing events, we identified exon 6 skipping of RPS24, which is likely to be a cancer driver. We also identified five common fusion genes between HCC and its corresponding PVTT samples, including ARID1A-GPATCH3, MDM1-NUP107, PTGES3-RARG, PRLR-TERT, and C9orf3-TMC1. All of these findings broaden our knowledge of PVTT development and may also contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of HCC patients with PVTT.",2016,"Hepatocellular carcinoma; alternative splicing; differentially expressed genes; gene fusion; portal vein tumor thrombus; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Extracellular Matrix; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Portal Vein; Prognosis; Ribosomal Proteins; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; Venous Thrombosis",2

The identification of prognostic biomarker can improve prognosis and personalized treatment regimes. Herein, we collected gene expression datasets representing TNBC and Non-TNBC BrCa. From the complete dataset, a subset reflecting solely known cancer driver genes was also constructed. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was employed to identify top 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 gene signatures that differentiate TNBC from the other BrCa subtypes. Five machine learning algorithms were employed on these selected features and on the basis of model performance evaluation, it was found that for the complete and driver dataset, XGBoost performs the best for a subset of 25 and 20 genes, respectively. Out of these 45 genes from the two datasets, <i>34</i> genes were found to be differentially regulated. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis for Distant Metastasis Free Survival (DMFS) of these 34 differentially regulated genes revealed four genes, out of which two are novel that could be potential prognostic genes (<i>POU2AF1 and S100B</i>). Finally, interactome and pathway enrichment analyses were carried out to investigate the functional role of the identified potential prognostic genes in TNBC. These genes are associated with MAPK, PI3-AkT, Wnt, TGF-&#x3b2;, and other signal transduction pathways, pivotal in metastasis cascade.

Here we detect, categorize, and characterize site-specific hotspots using 2279 whole cancer genomes from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes project and provide a resource of annotated hotspots genome-wide. We investigate the excess of hotspots in both protein-coding and gene regulatory regions and develop measures of positive selection and functional impact for individual hotspots. Using cancer allele fractions, expression aberrations, mutational signatures, and a variety of genomic features, such as potential gain or loss of transcription factor binding sites, we annotate and prioritize all highly mutated hotspots. Genome-wide we find more high-frequency SNV and indel hotspots than expected given mutational background models. Protein-coding regions are generally enriched for SNV hotspots compared to other regions. Gene regulatory hotspots show enrichment of potential same-patient second-hit missense mutations, consistent with enrichment of hotspot driver mutations compared to singletons. For protein-coding regions, splice-sites, promoters, and enhancers, we see an excess of hotspots associated with cancer genes. Interestingly, missense hotspot mutations in tumor suppressors are associated with elevated expression, suggesting localized amino-acid changes with functional impact. For individual non-coding hotspots, only a small number show clear signs of positive selection, including known sites in the TERT promoter and the 5' UTR of TP53. Most of the new candidates have few mutations and limited driver evidence. However, a hotspot in an enhancer of the oncogene POU2AF1, which may create a transcription factor binding site, presents multiple lines of driver-consistent evidence.",2021,NA,3

Some patients suffer histological transformation to a more aggressive subtype with poorer prognosis. This study aimed to improve our understanding of the genetics underlying FL histological transformation, and to identify genetic drivers or promoters of the transformation by elucidating the differences between FL samples from patients who did and did not transform. We conducted targeted massive parallel sequencing of 22 pre-transformed FL/transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma pairs and 20 diagnostic samples from non-transformed FL patients. Additionally, 22 matched samples from 11 transformed FL patients (pre-transformed FL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and 9 non-transformed FLs were studied for copy number variation using SNP arrays. We identified recurrently mutated genes that were enriched at transformation, most notably LRP1B, GNA13 and POU2AF1, which have roles in B-cell differentiation, GC architecture and migration. Mutations in POU2AF1 might be associated with lower levels of expression, were more frequent in transformed FLs, and seemed to be specific to transformed- compared with de novo-diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Pre-transformed FLs carried more mutations per sample and had greater subclonal heterogeneity than non-transformed FLs. Finally, we identified four mutated genes in FL samples that differed between patients who did and did not transform: NOTCH2, DTX1, UBE2A and HIST1H1E. The presence of mutations in these genes was associated with shorter time to transformation when mutated in the FL biopsies.

Although teratoma is usually curable, in rare cases it can give rise to various somatic tumors and exceptionally it undergoes melanocytic neuroectodermal tumor (MNT) transformation, a process that is not well-described. We report a patient with a postchemotherapy thymic teratoma associated with an MNT component who, 10 years later, additionally presented a vertebral metastasis corresponding to an anaplastic MNT. Using exome sequencing of the mature teratoma, the MNT and its metastatic vertebral anaplastic MNT components, we identified 19 somatic mutations shared by at least two components. Six mutations were common to all three components, and three of them were located in the known cancer-related genes <i>KRAS</i> (p.E63K), <i>TP53</i> (p.P222X), and <i>POLQ</i> (p.S447P). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the melanoma tumorigenesis pathway was enriched in mutated genes including the four major driver genes <i>KRAS</i>, <i>TP53</i>, <i>ERBB4</i>, and <i>KDR</i>, indicating that these genes may be involved in the development of the anaplastic MNT transformation of the teratoma.

We evaluated gastric intratumoral heterogeneity using multiregional sequencing of &gt;700 cancer genes in 115 tumor biopsies from 32 patients, 29 who were Latinos. Analyses focused on comparisons with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and on mutation clonality, druggability, and signatures. We found that only approximately 30% of all mutations were clonal and that only 61% of the known TCGA gastric cancer drivers harbored clonal mutations. Multiple clonal mutations were found in new candidate gastric cancer drivers such as <i>EYS, FAT4, PCDHA1</i>, <i>RAD50, EXO1, RECQL4,</i> and <i>FSIP2.</i> The genomically stable (GS) molecular subtype, which has the worse prognosis, was identified in 48% of our Latino patients, a fraction that was &gt;2.3-fold higher than in TCGA Asian and White patients. Only a third of all tumors harbored clonal pathogenic mutations in druggable genes, with most (93%) GS tumors lacking actionable clonal mutations. Mutation signature analyses revealed that, in microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors, DNA repair mutations were common for both tumor initiation and progression, while tobacco, <i>POLE</i>, and inflammation signatures likely initiate carcinogenesis. MSS tumor progression was likely driven by aging- and aflatoxin-associated mutations, as these latter changes were usually nonclonal. In microsatellite-unstable tumors, nonclonal tobacco-associated mutations were common. Our study, therefore, contributed to advancing gastric cancer molecular diagnostics and suggests clonal status is important to understanding gastric tumorigenesis. Our findings of a higher frequency of a poor prognosis associated molecular subtype in Latinos and a possible new aflatoxin gastric cancer etiology also advance cancer disparities research.

But rare research focuses on the alternation of fatty acid metabolism (FAM) in CC. Therefore, we constructed and compared models based on the expression of FAM-related genes from the Cancer Genome Atlas by different machine learning algorithms. The most reliable model was built with 14 significant genes by LASSO-Cox regression, and the CC cohort was divided into low-/high-risk groups by the median of risk score. Then, a feasible nomogram was established and validated by <i>C</i>-index, calibration curve, net benefit, and decision curve analysis. Furthermore, the hub genes among differential expression genes were identified and the post-transcriptional and translational regulation networks were characterized. Moreover, the somatic mutation and copy number variation landscapes were depicted. Importantly, the specific mutation drivers and signatures of the FAM phenotypes were excavated. As a result, the high-risk samples were featured by activated de novo fatty acid synthesis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and chronic inflammation response, which might be caused by mutations of oncogenic driver genes in RTK/RAS, PI3K, and NOTCH signalling pathways. Besides the hyperactivity of cytidine deaminase and deficiency of mismatch repair, the mutations of POLE might be partially responsible for the mutations in the high-risk group. Next, the antigenome including the neoantigen and cancer germline antigens was estimated. The decreasing expression of a series of cancer germline antigens was identified to be related to reduction of CD8 T cell infiltration in the high-risk group. Then, the comprehensive evaluation of connotations between the tumour microenvironment and FAM phenotypes demonstrated that the increasing risk score was related to the suppressive immune microenvironment. Finally, the prediction of therapy targets revealed that the patients with high risk might be sensitive to the RAF inhibitor AZ628. Our findings provide a novel insight for personalized treatment in CC.",2023,NA,90

Germline assessment of at least 76 cancer predisposition genes was performed in patients with EC undergoing clinical tumor-normal Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) sequencing from January 1, 2015, to June 30, 2021. In patients with gPVs, biallelic alterations in ECs were identified through analysis of loss of heterozygosity and somatic PVs. Clinicopathologic variables were compared using nonparametric tests. Of 1625 patients with EC, 216 (13%) had gPVs, and 15 patients had 2 gPVs. There were 231 gPVs in 35 genes (75 [32%] high penetrance; 39 [17%] moderate penetrance; and 117 [51%] low, recessive, or uncertain penetrance). Compared with those without gPVs, patients with gPVs were younger (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.002), more often White (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.009), and less obese (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.025) and had differences in distribution of tumor histology (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.017) and molecular subtype (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). Among 231 gPVs, 74 (32%) exhibited biallelic inactivation within tumors. For high-penetrance gPVs, 63% (47 of 75) of ECs had biallelic alterations, primarily affecting mismatch repair (MMR) and homologous recombination related genes, including BRCA1,BRCA2, RAD51D, and PALB2. Biallelic inactivation varied across molecular subtypes with highest rates in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or copy-number (CN)-high subtypes (3 of 12 [25%] POLE, 30 of 77 [39%] MSI-H, 27 of 60 [45%] CN-high, 9 of 57 [16%] CN-low; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). Of unselected patients with EC, 13% had gPVs, with 63% of gPVs in high-penetrance genes (MMR and homologous recombination) exhibiting biallelic inactivation, potentially driving cancer development.

We discovered RS-specific somatic driver mutations (including IRF2BP2, SRSF1, B2M, DNMT3A and CCND3), recurrent copy-number alterations beyond del(9p21)(CDKN2A/B), whole-genome duplication and chromothripsis, which were confirmed in 45 independent RS cases and in an external set of RS whole genomes. Through unsupervised clustering, clonally related RS was largely distinct from diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

There is a large unmet medical need for antifibrotic therapies. Claudin-1 (CLDN1) is a member of the tight junction protein family. Although the role of CLDN1 incorporated in tight junctions is well established, the function of nonjunctional CLDN1 (njCLDN1) is largely unknown. Using highly specific monoclonal antibodies targeting a conformation-dependent epitope of exposed njCLDN1, we show in patient-derived liver three-dimensional fibrosis and human liver chimeric mouse models that CLDN1 is a mediator and target for liver fibrosis. Targeting CLDN1 reverted inflammation-induced hepatocyte profibrogenic signaling and cell fate and suppressed the myofibroblast differentiation of hepatic stellate cells. Safety studies of a fully humanized antibody in nonhuman primates did not reveal any serious adverse events even at high steady-state concentrations. Our results provide preclinical proof of concept for CLDN1-specific monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of advanced liver fibrosis and cancer prevention. Antifibrotic effects in lung and kidney fibrosis models further indicate a role of CLDN1 as a therapeutic target for tissue fibrosis across organs. In conclusion, our data pave the way for further therapeutic exploration of CLDN1-targeting therapies for fibrotic diseases in patients.",2022,"Animals; Mice; Humans; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Claudin-1; Cell Plasticity; Liver Cirrhosis",90

We modeled the genetic heterogeneity of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) through multiplexed in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 B-cell editing of recurrent CLL loss-of-function drivers in mice and recapitulated the process of transformation from indolent CLL into large cell lymphoma [i.e., Richter syndrome (RS)]. Evolutionary trajectories of 64 mice carrying diverse combinatorial gene assortments revealed coselection of mutations in Trp53, Mga, and Chd2 and the dual impact of clonal Mga/Chd2 mutations on E2F/MYC and interferon signaling dysregulation. Comparative human and murine RS analyses demonstrated tonic PI3K signaling as a key feature of transformed disease, with constitutive activation of the AKT and S6 kinases, downmodulation of the PTEN phosphatase, and convergent activation of MYC/PI3K transcriptional programs underlying enhanced sensitivity to MYC/mTOR/PI3K inhibition. This robust experimental system presents a unique framework to study lymphoid biology and therapy. Mouse models reflective of the genetic complexity and heterogeneity of human tumors remain few, including those able to recapitulate transformation to aggressive disease histologies. Herein, we model CLL transformation into RS through multiplexed in vivo gene editing, providing key insight into the pathophysiology and therapeutic vulnerabilities of transformed disease.

It is currently not known whether PSCs accumulate genetic alterations that contribute to tumor biology. Our aim was to analyze genetic alterations in cancer associated PSCs. PSC DNA was matched to DNA isolated from pancreatic cancer patients' blood (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5) and analyzed by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Bioinformatic analysis was performed using the GATK software and pathogenicity prediction scores. Sanger sequencing was carried out to verify specific genetic alterations in a larger panel of PSCs (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50). NGS and GATK analysis identified on average 26 single nucleotide variants in PSC DNA as compared to the matched blood DNA that could be visualized with the Integrative Genomics Viewer. The absence of PDAC driver mutations (KRAS, p53, p16/INK4a, SMAD4) confirmed that PSC isolations were not contaminated with cancer cells. After filtering the variants, using different pathogenicity scores, ten genes were identified (SERPINB2, CNTNAP4, DENND4B, DPP4, FGFBP2, MIGA2, POLE, SNRNP40, TOP2B, and ZDHHC18) in single samples and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. As a proof of concept, functional analysis using control and SERPINB2 knock-out fibroblasts revealed functional effects on growth, migration, and collagen contraction.

Previous studies have suggested that <i>CSPP1</i> plays a role in tumorigenesis; however, no pan-cancer analysis has been performed. This study systematically investigates the expression of <i>CSPP1</i> and its potential clinical outcomes associated with diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. <i>CSPP1</i> is widely present in tissues and cells and its aberrant expression serves as a diagnostic biomarker for cancer. <i>CSPP1</i> dysregulation is driven by multi-dimensional mechanisms involving genetic alterations, DNA methylation, and miRNAs. Phosphorylation of CSPP1 at specific sites may play a role in tumorigenesis. In addition, <i>CSPP1</i> correlates with clinical features and outcomes in multiple cancers. Take brain low-grade gliomas (LGG) with a poor prognosis as an example, functional enrichment analysis implies that <i>CSPP1</i> may play a role in ferroptosis and tumor microenvironment (TME), including regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stromal response, and immune response. Further analysis confirms that <i>CSPP1</i> dysregulates ferroptosis in LGG and other cancers, making it possible for ferroptosis-based drugs to be used in the treatment of these cancers. Importantly, <i>CSPP1</i>-associated tumors are infiltrated in different TMEs, rendering immune checkpoint blockade therapy beneficial for these cancer patients. Our study is the first to demonstrate that <i>CSPP1</i> is a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker associated with ferroptosis and TME, providing a new target for drug therapy and immunotherapy in specific cancers.",2022,"ACC, adrenocortical carcinoma; BP, biological pathways; BRCA, breast invasive carcinoma; Biomarker; C-index, concordance index; CAF, cancer-associated fibroblasts; CC, cellular component; CESC, cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma; CHOL, cholangiocarcinoma; CNA, copy number alteration; COAD, colon adenocarcinoma; CPTAC, Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium; CSPP1; CSPP1, centrosome and spindle pole-associated protein; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; DEGs, differentially expressed genes; DLBC, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; DSS, disease-specific survival; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; ENCORI, Encyclopedia of RNA Interactomes; ESCA, esophageal carcinoma; FAG, ferroptosis-associated gene; FDG, ferroptosis-driver gene; FSG, ferroptosis-suppressor gene; Ferroptosis; GBM, glioblastoma multiforme; GO, Gene Ontology; GSEA, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis; GSVA, gene set variation analysis; GTEx, Genotype-Tissue Expression; HNSC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; ICB, immune checkpoint blockade; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; KICH, kidney chromophobe; KIRC, renal clear cell carcinoma; KM, Kaplan-Meier; LAML, acute myeloid leukemia; LGG, low-grade gliomas; LIHC, liver hepatocellular carcinoma; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma; LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma; MF, molecular functions; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MSI, microsatellite instability; OS, overall survival; OV, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma; PAAD, pancreatic adenocarcinoma; PFI, progression-free interval; PFS, progression-free survival; PRAD, prostate cancer; Pan-cancer; READ, rectum adenocarcinoma; ROC, receiver operating characteristics; SKCM, skin cutaneous melanoma; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas; TGCT, testicular germ cell tumors, STAD, stomach adenocarcinoma; THCA, thyroid cancer; THYM, thymoma; TIDE, Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion; TIMER, Tumor Immune Estimation Resource; TISIDB, Tumor-Immune System Interactions DataBase; TMB, tumor mutation burden; TME, tumor microenvironment; Tumor microenvironment; UCEC, endometrial cancer uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma; UCS, uterine carcinosarcoma",90

We highlight the clinicopathological profile and somatic mutations in periocular PBCC. The clinicopathological features and somatic mutations in patients with periocular PBCC were examined and compared with periocular non-PBCC reported in the literature. Next-generation sequencing panel analysis for the excised tumors identified somatic mutations. In a total of 31 patients, PBCC was common in females (54%; p = 0.03); as a unilateral lower eyelid (n = 22; 71%), solitary mass (n = 30; 98%). Pathologic subtypes were variable. Most were nodular or mixed variants (n = 23; 74%). During the follow up (2.5-4.5 years), 1 patient (3.5%) had a recurrence. The clinical and pathologic features of PBCC were similar to those reported in nonperiocular locations. Somatic mutations detected in 25/31 tumors. Variants in 50/161 genes in the panel were noted. PTCH1 (14/31), TERT (12/31), and SMO (7/31) variants were common. Fifteen patients had novel drivers, including POLE, FANCD2, and CREBBP.

However, not all individuals with colonic adenomas have a risk of CRC substantially higher than those of the general population. The aim of the study was to determine the differences or similarities of mutation profile among low- and high-grade adenomas and in situ carcinoma with detailed follow up. We have investigated the mutation spectrum of well-known genes involved in CRC (such as APC, BRAF, EGFR, NRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, POLE, POLD1, SMAD4, PTEN, and TP53) in a large, well-defined series of 96 adenomas and in situ carcinomas using a high-throughput genotyping technique. Besides, the microsatellite instability and APC and MLH1 promoter methylation were studied as well. We observed a high frequency of pathogenic variants in the studied genes. The APC, KRAS and TP53 mutation frequencies were slightly lower in adenoma samples than in in situ carcinoma samples. Further, when we stratified mutation frequency based on the grade, the frequency distribution was as follows: low-grade adenoma-high-grade adenomas-in situ carcinoma: APC gene 42.9-56.0-54.5%; KRAS gene 32.7-32.0-45.5%; TP53 gene 8.2-20.0-18.2%. The occurrence of KRAS mutation was associated with the presence of villous histology and methylation of the APC promoter was significantly associated with the presence of POLE genetic variations. However, no association was noticed with the presence of any singular mutation and occurrence of subsequent adenoma or CRC.

Little is known concerning the activity of PD-1 antibodies in locally advanced ACSCC. This study reports on the efficacy and toxicities of a neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade combined with chemotherapy followed by concurrent immunoradiotherapy in ACSCC patients, and describes biomarkers expression and mutation signatures. In this cohort study, patients were treated as planned, including four cycles of neoadjuvant PD-1 antibody toripalimab combined with docetaxol and cisplatin, followed by radiotherapy and two cycles of concurrent toripalimab. Multiplex immunofluorescence staining (mIHC) with PD-L1, CD8, CD163, Pan-Keratin and DAPI was performed with the pretreatment tumor tissue. Whole exome sequencing was performed for the primary tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The primary endpoint was the complete clinical response (cCR) rate at 3 months after overall treatment. Acute and late toxicities graded were assessed prospectively. Five female patients with a median age of 50 years old (range, 43-65 years old), finished treatment as planned. One patient had grade 3 immune related dermatitis. Two patients had grade 3 myelosuppression during neoadjuvant treatment. No severe radiation-related toxicities were noted. Four patients with PD-L1 expression &gt;1% achieved a cCR after neoadjuvant treatment. and the other patient with negative PD-L1 expression also achieved a cCR at 3 months after radiotherapy. All the patients were alive and free from disease and had a normal quality of life, with 19.6-24 months follow up. Inconsistent expression of PD-L1 and CD163 was detected in 3 and 5 patients, respectively. TTN, POLE, MGAM2 were the top mutation frequencies, and 80 significant driver genes were identified. Pathway analysis showed enrichment of apoptosis, Rap1, Ras, and pathways in cancer signaling pathways. Eight significantly deleted regions were identified.

Constitutional mismatch-repair deficiency (CMMRD), caused by germline bi-allelic PVs affecting one of four MMR genes, results in a high propensity for the hematological, brain, intestinal tract, and other malignancies in childhood. Nonmalignant clinical features, such as skin pigmentation alterations, are found in nearly all CMMRD patients and are important diagnostic markers. Here, we excluded CMMRD in three cancer patients with highly suspect clinical phenotypes but identified in each a constitutional heterozygous POLE PV. These, and two additional POLE PVs identified in published CMMRD-like patients, have not previously been reported as germline PVs despite all being well-known somatic mutations in hyper-mutated tumors. Together, these five cases show that specific POLE PVs may have a stronger ""mutator"" effect than known PPAP-associated POLE PVs and may cause a CMMRD-like phenotype distinct from PPAP.

As the main GIST drivers, gain-of-function mutations in <i>KIT</i> or <i>PDGFRA</i> are closely associated with not only tumor development and progression but also therapeutic response. In addition to the status of KIT and PDGFRA, little is known about other potential GIST-related genes. In this study, we identified the mutation profiles in 49 KIT-mutated GIST tumors using the whole exome sequencing (WES) method. Furthermore, some representative mutations were further validated in an independent GIST cohort using the SNaPshot SNP assay. We identified extensive and diverse mutations of KIT in GIST, including many undescribed variants. In addition, we revealed some new tumor-related gene mutations with unknown pathogenicity. By enrichment analyses of gene function and protein-protein interaction network construction, we showed that these genes were enriched in several important cancer- or metabolism-related signaling pathways, including PI3K-AKT,RTK-RAS, Notch, Wnt, Hippo, mTOR, AMPK, and insulin signaling. In particular, DNA repair-related genes, including <i>MLH1</i>, <i>MSH6</i>, <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>, and <i>POLE</i>, are frequently mutated in GISTs, suggesting that immune checkpoint blockade may have promising clinical applications for these GIST subpopulations.

The primary objective of the MULTISARC trial is to assess whether NGS can be conducted for a large proportion of metastatic STS participants within a reasonable time, and, secondarily to determine whether a NGS-guided therapeutic strategy improves participant's outcome. This is a randomized, multicentre, phase II/III trial inspired by the design of umbrella and biomarker-driven trials. The setting plans up to 17 investigational centres across France and the recruitment of 960 participants.

The functional and clinical implications of different polymerase variants remain unclear. Targeted next-generation sequencing using a 425-cancer gene panel, which covers all exonic regions of three polymerase genes (<i>POLE</i>, <i>POLD1</i>, and <i>POLH</i>), was conducted in a cohort of 12,266 patients across 16 different tumor types from January 2017 to January 2019. Prognostication of <i>POL</i> variant-positive patients was performed using a cohort of 4679 patients from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. The overall prevalence of somatic and germline polymerase variants was 4.2% (95% CI 3.8% to 4.5%) and 0.7% (95% CI 0.5% to 0.8%), respectively, with highest frequencies in endometrial, urinary, prostate, and colorectal cancers (CRCs). While most germline polymerase variants showed no clear functional consequences, we identified a candidate p.T466A affecting the exonuclease domain of POLE, which might be underlying the early onset in a case with childhood CRC. Low frequencies of known hot-spot somatic mutations in <i>POLE</i> were detected and were associated with younger age, the male sex, and microsatellite stability. In both the panel and TCGA cohorts, <i>POLE</i> drivers exhibited high frequencies of alterations in genes in the DNA damage and repair (DDR) pathways, including <i>BRCA2</i>, <i>ATM</i>, <i>MSH6</i>, and <i>ATR</i>. Variants of unknown significance (VUS) of different polymerase domains showed variable penetrance with those in the exonuclease domain of <i>POLE</i> and <i>POLD1</i> displaying high TMB. VUS in <i>POL</i> genes exhibited an additive effect as carriers of multiple VUS had exponentially increased TMB and prolonged overall survival. Similar to cases with driver mutations, the TMB-high <i>POL</i> VUS samples showed DDR pathway involvement and polymerase hypermutation signatures. Combinatorial analysis of <i>POL</i> and DDR pathway status further supported the potential additive effects of <i>POL</i> VUS and DDR pathway genes and revealed distinct prognostic subclasses that were independent of cancer type and TMB.

By quantifying the contribution of COSMIC mutational signature 10 in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) we set out to identify POLE-driven tumors in a set of unselected Mayo Clinic OC. Mutational profiles were calculated using expressed single-nucleotide variants (eSNV) in the Mayo Clinic OC tumors (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;195), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) OC tumors (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;419), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) normal ovarian tissues (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;84). Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) of the mutational profiles inferred the contribution per sample of four distinct mutational signatures, one of which corresponds to COSMIC mutational signature 10. In the Mayo Clinic OC cohort we identified six tumors with a predicted contribution from COSMIC mutational signature 10 of over five mutations per megabase. These six cases harbored known POLE hotspot mutations (P286R, S297F, V411L, and A456P) and were of endometrioid histotype (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;5e-04).

Moreover, LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP1) was a functional target of miR-431 in modulating CRC cell malignant progression. Furthermore, circ-CSPP1 in CRC cells functioned as a posttranscriptional regulator on LASP1 expression by targeting miR-431.

The global eNRGy1 registry was thus established to characterize <i>NRG1</i> fusion-positive lung cancers in the largest and most diverse series to date. From June 2018 to February 2020, a consortium of 22 centers from nine countries in Europe, Asia, and the United States contributed data from patients with pathologically confirmed <i>NRG1</i> fusion-positive lung cancers. Profiling included DNA-based and/or RNA-based next-generation sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Anonymized clinical, pathologic, molecular, and response (RECIST v1.1) data were centrally curated and analyzed. Although the typified never smoking (57%), mucinous adenocarcinoma (57%), and nonmetastatic (71%) phenotype predominated in 110 patients with <i>NRG1</i> fusion-positive lung cancer, further diversity, including in smoking history (43%) and histology (43% nonmucinous and 6% nonadenocarcinoma), was elucidated. RNA-based testing identified most fusions (74%). Molecularly, six (of 18) novel 5' partners, 20 unique epidermal growth factor domain-inclusive chimeric events, and heterogeneous 5'/3' breakpoints were found. Platinum-doublet and taxane-based (post-platinum-doublet) chemotherapy achieved low objective response rates (ORRs 13% and 14%, respectively) and modest progression-free survival medians (PFS 5.8 and 4.0 months, respectively).

Afatinib achieved an ORR of 25%, not contingent on fusion type, and a 2.8-month median PFS. <i>NRG1</i> fusion-positive lung cancers were molecularly, pathologically, and clinically more heterogeneous than previously recognized. The activity of cytotoxic, immune, and targeted therapies was disappointing. Further research examining <i>NRG1</i>-rearranged tumor biology is needed to develop new therapeutic strategies.",2021,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Asia; Biomarkers, Tumor; Europe; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Immunotherapy; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neuregulin-1; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Prognosis; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; United States",90
