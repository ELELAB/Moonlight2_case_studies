35993362,FRY,10.1172/jci.insight.155218,Inactivation of Hippo pathway characterizes a poor-prognosis subtype of esophageal cancer.,"Identification of molecular subtypes that reflect different prognoses and treatment responses, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is essential for treatment decisions. We performed targeted sequencing in 201 patients with ESCC to discover genetic subtypes and validate our findings via multiple data sets. We identified 3 driver genes (FCGBP, GRIN2B, and FRY), and recurrent truncating mutations in FRY impaired its tumor-suppressive function and promoted tumor proliferation. A 3-gene mutation signature (FAT1, FAT3, and FRY) recognized a molecular subtype named ""FAT/FRY"" with frequent Hippo pathway-related mutations. In multiple ESCC cohorts, the patients with the FAT/FRY subtype had poorer prognosis than did patients in the WT group. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the FAT/FRY subtype was characterized by inactivation of the Hippo pathway, hypoxia, chemoresistance, higher infiltration of CD8+ T cells and activated DCs, and a transcriptome similar to that of cancer responders. Furthermore, the 3-gene signature predicted better survival for patients treated with ICIs, partially explained by its positive correlation with the tumor mutation burden and neoantigen burden. The 3-gene signature is a biomarker to recognize the FAT/FRY molecular subtype, evaluate prognosis, and select potential beneficiaries of ICIs in ESCC.",2022,"Bioinformatics; Cancer; Gastroenterology; Oncology; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Hippo Signaling Pathway; Humans; Prognosis",5
30236235,FRY,10.1016/j.bja.2018.07.002,Cancelled operations: a 7-day cohort study of planned adult inpatient surgery in 245 UK National Health Service hospitals.,"Cancellation of planned surgery impacts substantially on patients and health systems. This study describes the incidence and reasons for cancellation of inpatient surgery in the UK NHS. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study over 7 consecutive days in March 2017 in 245 NHS hospitals. Occurrences and reasons for previous surgical cancellations were recorded. Using multilevel logistic regression, we identified patient- and hospital-level factors associated with cancellation due to inadequate bed capacity. We analysed data from 14 936 patients undergoing planned surgery. A total of 1499 patients (10.0%) reported previous cancellation for the same procedure; contemporaneous hospital census data indicated that 13.9% patients attending inpatient operations were cancelled on the day of surgery. Non-clinical reasons, predominantly inadequate bed capacity, accounted for a large proportion of previous cancellations. Independent risk factors for cancellation due to inadequate bed capacity included requirement for postoperative critical care [odds ratio (OR)=2.92; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.12-4.02; P&lt;0.001] and the presence of an emergency department in the treating hospital (OR=4.18; 95% CI, 2.22-7.89; P&lt;0.001). Patients undergoing cancer surgery (OR=0.32; 95% CI, 0.22-0.46; P&lt;0.001), obstetric procedures (OR=0.17; 95% CI, 0.08-0.32; P&lt;0.001), and expedited surgery (OR=0.39; 95% CI, 0.27-0.56; P&lt;0.001) were less likely to be cancelled. A significant proportion of patients presenting for surgery have experienced a previous cancellation for the same procedure. Cancer surgery is relatively protected, but bed capacity, including postoperative critical care requirements, are significant risk factors for previous cancellations.",2019,"Health Services Research; medical resource utilisation; operating room management; surgery; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; General Surgery; Health Facility Size; Hospital Bed Capacity; Humans; Incidence; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Neoplasms; Obstetrics; Postoperative Care; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; State Medicine; United Kingdom; Young Adult",5

Although oncogenic drivers such as epidermal growth factor receptor activation and Phosphatase and Tensin homolog inactivation are thought to promote the motility and invasiveness of GBM cells via phosphatidylinostitol 3-kinase activation, other unexplored mechanisms may also contribute to malignancy. Here we demonstrate that several components of the planar cell polarity (PCP) arm of non-canonical Wnt signaling including VANGL1, VANGL2 and FZD7 are transcriptionally upregulated in glioma and correlate with poorer patient outcome. Knockdown of the core PCP pathway component VANGL1 suppresses the motility of GBM cell lines, pointing to an important mechanistic role for this pathway in glioblastoma malignancy. We further observe that restoration of Nrdp1, a RING finger type E3 ubiquitin ligase whose suppression in GBM also correlates with poor prognosis, reduces GBM cell migration and invasiveness by suppressing PCP signaling. Our observations indicate that Nrdp1 physically interacts with the Vangl1 and Vangl2 proteins to mediate the K63-linked polyubiquitination of the Dishevelled, Egl-10 and Pleckstrin (DEP) domain of the Wnt pathway protein Dishevelled (Dvl). Ubiquitination hinders Dvl binding to phosphatidic acid, an interaction necessary for efficient Dvl recruitment to the plasma membrane upon Wnt stimulation of Fzd receptor and for the propagation of downstream signals. We conclude that the PCP pathway contributes significantly to the motility and hence the invasiveness of GBM cells, and that Nrdp1 acts as a negative regulator of PCP signaling by inhibiting Dvl through a novel polyubiquitination mechanism. We propose that the upregulation of core PCP components, together with the loss of the key negative regulator Nrdp1, act coordinately to promote GBM invasiveness and malignancy.",2017,"Carrier Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Polarity; Cells, Cultured; Dishevelled Proteins; Glioblastoma; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Membrane Proteins; Polyubiquitin; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases; Ubiquitination; Wnt Proteins",5

Persisting CAR-T cells generate sustained pressure against CD19 that may drive unique mechanisms of resistance. Pre-B ALL originates from a committed pre-B cell or an earlier progenitor, with potential to reprogram into other hematopoietic lineages. Here we report changes in lineage markers including myeloid conversion in patients following CD19 CAR therapy. Using murine ALL models we study the long-term effects of CD19 CAR-T cells and demonstrate partial or complete lineage switch as a consistent mechanism of CAR resistance depending on the underlying genetic oncogenic driver. Deletion of Pax5 or Ebf1 recapitulates lineage reprogramming occurring during CD19 CAR pressure. Our findings establish lineage switch as a mechanism of CAR resistance exposing inherent plasticity in genetic subtypes of pre-B-cell ALL.",2018,"Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Lineage; Cell Plasticity; Chromatin; Clone Cells; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Editing; Genome; Mice, Knockout; Myeloid Cells; Phenotype; Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell; Recurrence",5
26798964,FRY,10.1016/j.healthplace.2015.11.007,Multi-modal two-step floating catchment area analysis of primary health care accessibility.,"Two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) techniques are popular for measuring potential geographical accessibility to health care services. This paper proposes methodological enhancements to increase the sophistication of the 2SFCA methodology by incorporating both public and private transport modes using dedicated network datasets. The proposed model yields separate accessibility scores for each modal group at each demand point to better reflect the differential accessibility levels experienced by each cohort. An empirical study of primary health care facilities in South Wales, UK, is used to illustrate the approach. Outcomes suggest the bus-riding cohort of each census tract experience much lower accessibility levels than those estimated by an undifferentiated (car-only) model. Car drivers' accessibility may also be misrepresented in an undifferentiated model because they potentially profit from the lower demand placed upon service provision points by bus riders. The ability to specify independent catchment sizes for each cohort in the multi-modal model allows aspects of preparedness to travel to be investigated.",2017,"Algorithms; Catchment Area, Health; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Primary Health Care; Travel; Wales",5

Despite recent therapeutic advances, metastatic MTC remains incurable. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using genetically engineered T cells targeting either tissue-restricted tumor-associated antigens or mutated neoantigens has led to durable remissions in other metastatic solid tumors. The majority of MTC express the tumor-associated antigens calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and &#x223c;40% of MTC harbor the RET M918T oncogenic driver mutation. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We developed and characterized three immunoreceptors that recognize extracellular CEA, a calcitonin epitope presented by HLA-A*24:02, or an RET M918T neoepitope restricted by HLA-DPB1*04:01/02. The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting CEA was synthetically designed, while the T cell receptors (TCRs) targeting calcitonin and RET M918T were isolated from a transgenic mouse and patient with MTC, respectively. These immunoreceptors were genetically engineered into peripheral blood T cells and tested for antigen specificity and antitumor activity. <b><i>Results:</i></b> T cells expressing the anti-CEA CAR or the calcitonin-reactive TCR produced effector cytokines and displayed cytotoxicity against cell lines expressing their cognate antigen <i>in vitro</i>. In immunodeficient mice harboring a human MTC cell line, the adoptive transfer of T cells engineered to express the anti-CEA CAR or calcitonin-reactive TCR led to complete tumor regression. T cells expressing the HLA-DPB1*04:01/02-restricted TCR targeting RET M918T, which was cloned from peripheral blood CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of a patient with MTC, demonstrated specific reactivity against cells pulsed with the mutated peptide and MTC tumor cells that expressed HLA-DPB1*04:01 and RET M918T. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The preclinical data presented herein demonstrate the potential of using genetically engineered T cells targeting CEA, calcitonin, and/or RET M918T to treat metastatic MTC.",2022,"CEA CAR-T; RET M918T; adoptive cell therapy; calcitonin; medullary thyroid cancer; neoantigen; Animals; Calcitonin; Carcinoembryonic Antigen; Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine; Cell Engineering; Cell Line, Tumor; Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte; Humans; Mice; Mutation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell; T-Lymphocytes; Thyroid Neoplasms",1

There remains an unmet clinical need to improve how clinically significant prostate cancer is diagnosed and develop new treatments for advanced disease. Aberrant glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer implicated in tumour growth, metastasis, and immune evasion. One of the key drivers of aberrant glycosylation is the dysregulated expression of glycosylation enzymes within the cancer cell. Here, we demonstrate using multiple independent clinical cohorts that the glycosyltransferase enzyme GALNT7 is upregulated in prostate cancer tissue. We show GALNT7 can identify men with prostate cancer, using urine and blood samples, with improved diagnostic accuracy than serum PSA alone. We also show that GALNT7 levels remain high in progression to castrate-resistant disease, and using in vitro and in vivo models, reveal that GALNT7 promotes prostate tumour growth. Mechanistically, GALNT7 can modify O-glycosylation in prostate cancer cells and correlates with cell cycle and immune signalling pathways. Our study provides a new biomarker to aid the diagnosis of clinically significant disease and cements GALNT7-mediated O-glycosylation as an important driver of prostate cancer progression.",2023,Male; Humans; Up-Regulation; Glycosylation; Prostatic Neoplasms; Signal Transduction; Transcriptional Activation,2

In a previous study, we identified 51 putative cancer genes over-expressed in MPM tissues and cell lines. Here, we deepened the study on nine of them (<i>ASS1</i>, <i>EIF4G1</i>, <i>GALNT7</i>, <i>GLUT1</i>, <i>IGF2BP3</i> (<i>IMP3</i>), <i>ITGA4</i>, <i>RAN</i>, <i>SOD1</i>, and <i>THBS2</i>) to ascertain whether they are truly mesothelial cancer driver genes (CDGs) or genes overexpressed in an adaptive response to the tumoral progression (""passenger genes""). Through a fast siRNA-based screening, we evaluated the consequences of gene depletion on migration, proliferation, colony formation capabilities, and caspase activities of four MPM (Mero-14, Mero-25, IST-Mes2, and NCI-H28) and one SV40-immortalized mesothelial cell line (MeT-5A) as a non-malignant model. The depletion of <i>EIF4G1</i> and <i>RAN</i> significantly reduced cell proliferation and colony formation and increased caspase activity. In particular, the findings for RAN resemble those observed for other types of cancer. Thus, we evaluated the in vitro effects of importazole (IPZ), a small molecule inhibitor of the interaction between RAN and importin-&#x3b2;. We showed that IPZ could have effects similar to those observed following <i>RAN</i> gene silencing. We also found that primary cell lines from one out of three MPM patients were sensitive to IPZ. As <i>EIF4G1</i> and <i>RAN</i> deserve further investigation with additional in vitro and in vivo studies, they emerged as promising CDGs, suggesting that their upregulation could play a role in mesothelial tumorigenesis and aggressiveness. Furthermore, present data propose the molecular pathways dependent on RAN as a putative pharmacological target for MPM patients in the view of a future personalized medicine.",2021,"EIF4G1; MPM; RAN; cancer driving gene; importazole; siRNA; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Epithelium; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Mesothelioma, Malignant; Pleural Neoplasms; Quinazolines; RNA, Small Interfering; Small Molecule Libraries; beta Karyopherins; ran GTP-Binding Protein",2
36317529,RYR1,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.058777,Hippo-Yap Signaling Maintains Sinoatrial Node Homeostasis.,"The sinoatrial node (SAN) functions as the pacemaker of the heart, initiating rhythmic heartbeats. Despite its importance, the SAN is one of the most poorly understood cardiac entities because of its small size and complex composition and function. The Hippo signaling pathway is a molecular signaling pathway fundamental to heart development and regeneration. Although abnormalities of the Hippo pathway are associated with cardiac arrhythmias in human patients, the role of this pathway in the SAN is unknown. We investigated key regulators of the Hippo pathway in SAN pacemaker cells by conditionally inactivating the Hippo signaling kinases <i>Lats1</i> and <i>Lats2</i> using the tamoxifen-inducible, cardiac conduction system-specific Cre driver <i>Hcn4<sup>CreERT2</sup></i> with <i>Lats1</i> and <i>Lats2</i> conditional knockout alleles. In addition, the Hippo-signaling effectors <i>Yap</i> and <i>Taz</i> were conditionally inactivated in the SAN. To determine the function of Hippo signaling in the SAN and other cardiac conduction system components, we conducted a series of physiological and molecular experiments, including telemetry ECG recording, echocardiography, Masson Trichrome staining, calcium imaging, immunostaining, RNAscope, cleavage under targets and tagmentation sequencing using antibodies against Yap1 or H3K4me3, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting. We also performed comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of various datasets. We found that <i>Lats1/2</i> inactivation caused severe sinus node dysfunction. Compared with the controls, <i>Lats1/2</i> conditional knockout mutants exhibited dysregulated calcium handling and increased fibrosis in the SAN, indicating that <i>Lats1/2</i> function through both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. It is notable that the <i>Lats1/2</i> conditional knockout phenotype was rescued by genetic deletion of <i>Yap</i> and <i>Taz</i> in the cardiac conduction system. These rescued mice had normal sinus rhythm and reduced fibrosis of the SAN, indicating that <i>Lats1/2</i> function through <i>Yap</i> and <i>Taz.</i> Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation sequencing data showed that Yap potentially regulates genes critical for calcium homeostasis such as <i>Ryr2</i> and genes encoding paracrine factors important in intercellular communication and fibrosis induction such as <i>Tgfb1</i> and <i>Tgfb3</i>. Consistent with this, <i>Lats1/2</i> conditional knockout mutants had decreased <i>Ryr2</i> expression and increased <i>Tgfb1</i> and <i>Tgfb3</i> expression compared with control mice. We reveal, for the first time to our knowledge, that the canonical Hippo-Yap pathway plays a pivotal role in maintaining SAN homeostasis.",2022,"Hippo signaling pathway; calcium homeostasis; fibrosis; sinus node dysfunction; transforming growth factor-&#x3b2;; Humans; Mice; Animals; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Cell Cycle Proteins; Transforming Growth Factor beta3; Phosphoproteins; Sinoatrial Node; Calcium; Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Homeostasis; Fibrosis; Cell Proliferation; Tumor Suppressor Proteins",5
36168622,RYR1,10.7150/thno.70814,The metabolic genomic atlas reveals potential drivers and clinically relevant insights into the etiology of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"<b>Background:</b> Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common cancers globally, with a poor prognosis and ambiguous therapy target. As a hallmark of cancer, metabolism reprogramming plays a critical role in the development of ESCC; however, the genomic alterations underlying this reconfiguration are still largely unknown. <b>Methods:</b> We have comprehensively studied the metabolic genomic variations in an integrated ESCC cohort of 490 patients and characterized the somatic alterations associated with various metabolic pathways. <b>Results:</b> The somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) occurred heterogeneously in all patients. Using CNA-based clustering, we stratified patients into three clusters and Cluster3 with more deletions marked for worse prognosis. Our findings revealed detailed genetic alterations in components of metabolic pathways and highlighted the role of metal ion channel transporters and non-neuronal/neuronal synapse systems in the development of ESCC. We found a subset of potential metabolic drivers and functionally validated RYR2, MGST3, and CYP8B1 involved in the ESCC-associated malignancy. Another key finding was that we identified 27 metabolic genes with genomic alterations that could serve as independent prognostic factors and figured out two genetic panels that could stratify patients into distinct prognostic groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> Collectively, our study provided a deep insight into the metabolic landscape in ESCC, extending our understanding of the metabolic reconfiguration underlying the genomic basis of ESCC. Furthermore, our findings revealed potential prognostic factors of ESCC, which are expected to contribute to the accurate determination of the prognosis in the clinic.",2022,"ESCC; clinical implications; copy number alterations (CNAs); metabolic genomic atlas; somatic mutations; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Genomics; Humans; Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel; Steroid 12-alpha-Hydroxylase",5

To improve risk stratification, we sought to identify genetic biosignatures by whole-exome sequencing (WES). We retrieved patients with OCSCC patients with paired freshly frozen malignant and non-malignant tissue specimens and performed WES by Illumina HiSeq4000 platform. We further applied a tree-based method to analyze copy number variations and obtain signature classification and driver-gene identification. We further confirmed the prognostic impact of the WES biosignature in an external independent validation set. We examined 168 paired samples from patients with surgically treated OCSCC. Similar to the literature, the most commonly mutated genes were TP53 (66%), FAT1 (32%), and NOTCH1 (24%). The signatures 13 (APOBEC Cytidine deaminase [C&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;G]), 1 (spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine), and 7 (UV exposure) showed the highest concordance rates. Using the MutSigCV, MuSiC, 20/20+, OncodriveFML, e-Driver, OncodriveCLUST, and tree-based methods, we identified a nine-gene OCSCC panel (RYR1, HLA-B, TSHZ2, PCDH17, DNAH17, GRID1, SBNO2, KSR2, and GCN1L1) predicting survival outcomes in our sample. We used the TCGA database to validate the prognostic value of the panel independently. Furthermore, gene-gene covariance analysis confirmed the coexistence of several gene alterations. We identified and independently validated a WES biosignature that predicts outcomes in surgically treated OCSCC in Taiwan, a betel-quid-chewing-prevent area. We proposed that the panel might help clinical trial designation for adjuvant therapy based on the risk stratification from the novel gene panel and identify targets for liquid biopsy monitoring during surveillance.",2022,Betel quid; Biosignatures; Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma; Prognosis; Risk stratification; Whole-exome sequencing; DNA Copy Number Variations; Humans; Mouth Neoplasms; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; Taiwan; Exome Sequencing,5
33232371,RYR1,10.1371/journal.pone.0242780,Discovering novel driver mutations from pan-cancer analysis of mutational and gene expression profiles.,"As the genomic profile across cancers varies from person to person, patient prognosis and treatment may differ based on the mutational signature of each tumour. Thus, it is critical to understand genomic drivers of cancer and identify potential mutational commonalities across tumors originating at diverse anatomical sites. Large-scale cancer genomics initiatives, such as TCGA, ICGC and GENIE have enabled the analysis of thousands of tumour genomes. Our goal was to identify new cancer-causing mutations that may be common across tumour sites using mutational and gene expression profiles. Genomic and transcriptomic data from breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers were aggregated and analysed using differential gene expression methods to identify the effect of specific mutations on the expression of multiple genes. Mutated genes associated with the most differentially expressed genes were considered to be novel candidates for driver mutations, and were validated through literature mining, pathway analysis and clinical data investigation. Our driver selection method successfully identified 116 probable novel cancer-causing genes, with 4 discovered in patients having no alterations in any known driver genes: MXRA5, OBSCN, RYR1, and TG. The candidate genes previously not officially classified as cancer-causing showed enrichment in cancer pathways and in cancer diseases. They also matched expectations pertaining to properties of cancer genes, for instance, showing larger gene and protein lengths, and having mutation patterns suggesting oncogenic or tumor suppressor properties. Our approach allows for the identification of novel putative driver genes that are common across cancer sites using an unbiased approach without any a priori knowledge on pathways or gene interactions and is therefore an agnostic approach to the identification of putative common driver genes acting at multiple cancer sites.",2021,"Databases, Nucleic Acid; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; Mutation; Oncogene Proteins; Precancerous Conditions; Transcriptome",5

Decreased muscle function impacts cancer patient quality of life and health status, and several potential therapeutics have failed in clinical trials due to a lack of functional improvement. Furthermore, systemic inflammation and intrinsic inflammatory signaling's role in the cachectic disruption of muscle function requires further investigation. We examined skeletal muscle functional properties during cancer cachexia and determined their relationship to systemic and intrinsic cachexia indices. Male Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> (MIN) mice were stratified by percent body weight loss into weight stable (WS; &lt;5% loss) or cachectic (CX; &gt;5% loss). Age-matched C57BL/6 littermates served as controls. Tibialis anterior (TA) twitch properties, tetanic force, and fatigability were examined in situ. TA protein and mRNA expression were examined in the nonstimulated leg. CX decreased muscle mass, tetanic force (P<sub>o</sub>), and specific tetanic force (<sub>s</sub>P<sub>o</sub>). Whole body and muscle fatigability were increased in WS and CX. CX had slower contraction rates, +dP/d t and -dP/d t, which were inversely associated with muscle signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3) and p65 activation. STAT3 and p65 activation were also inversely associated with P<sub>o</sub>. However, STAT3 was not related to <sub>s</sub>P<sub>o</sub> or fatigue. Muscle suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 mRNA expression was negatively associated with TA weight, P<sub>o</sub>, and <sub>s</sub>P<sub>o</sub> but not fatigue. Our study demonstrates that multiple functional deficits that occur with cancer cachexia are associated with increased muscle inflammatory signaling. Notably, muscle fatigability is increased in the MIN mouse before cachexia development. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Recent studies have identified decrements in skeletal muscle function during cachexia. We have extended these studies by directly relating decrements in muscle function to established cachexia indices. Our results demonstrate that a slow-fatigable contractile phenotype is developed during the progression of cachexia that coincides with increased muscle inflammatory signaling. Furthermore, regression analysis identified predictors of cancer-induced muscle dysfunction. Last, we report the novel finding that whole body and muscle fatigability were increased before cachexia development.",2019,"fatigability; interleukin-6; muscle fatigue; muscle force; muscle twitch characteristics; Animals; Cachexia; Calsequestrin; Disease Progression; Male; Mice; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Fatigue; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Neoplasms; Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases",5

In the adult brain, NSCs are largely quiescent, suggesting that deregulation of quiescence maintenance may be a prerequisite for tumor initiation. Although inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 is a frequent event in gliomagenesis, whether or how it affects quiescent NSCs (qNSCs) remains unclear. Here, we show that p53 maintains quiescence by inducing fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) and that acute p53 deletion in qNSCs results in their premature activation to a proliferative state. Mechanistically, this occurs through direct transcriptional induction of PPARGC1a, which in turn activates PPAR&#x3b1; to upregulate FAO genes. Dietary supplementation with fish oil containing omega-3 fatty acids, natural PPAR&#x3b1; ligands, fully restores quiescence of p53-deficient NSCs and delays tumor initiation in a glioblastoma mouse model. Thus, diet can silence glioblastoma driver mutations, with important implications for cancer prevention.",2023,fatty acid oxidation; metabolism; neural stem cells; p53; quiescence; tumour initiation; Mice; Animals; Glioblastoma; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; PPAR alpha; Diet; Neural Stem Cells; Mutation,14
36735267,PPARGC1A,10.1167/tvst.12.2.4,Integrated Whole-Exome and Transcriptome Sequencing Indicated Dysregulation of Cholesterol Metabolism in Eyelid Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma.,"To identify the molecular background of eyelid sebaceous gland carcinomas (SCs), we conducted the integrated whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing for eyelid SCs in this study. The genetic alterations were studied by whole-exome sequencing, and the messenger RNA expression was studied using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) in five paired fresh eyelid SC tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Integrated analysis of exome and transcriptomic information was conducted for filtering candidate driver genes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of filtered candidate genes was analyzed by STRING. The protein expression was verified by immunohistochemistry in 29 eyelid SCs and 17 compared normal sebaceous gland tissues. The average numbers of pathogenic somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels in eyelid SCs were 75 and 28, respectively. Tumor protein p53 (TP53), zinc finger protein 750 (ZNF750), filaggrin 2 (FLG2), valosin-containing protein (VCP), and zinc finger protein 717 (ZNF717) were recurrent mutated genes. A mean of 844 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated, and 1401 DEGs were downregulated in SC samples. The intersection of DEG-based pathways and mutation-based pathways was mainly involved in microbial infection and inflammation, immunodeficiency, cancer, lipid metabolism, and the other pathways. The intersection of DEGs and mutated genes consisted of 55 genes, of which 15 genes formed a PPI network with 4 clusters. The PPI cluster composed of scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; (PPARG), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3b3; coactivator 1&#x3b1; (PPARGC1A) was involved in cholesterol metabolism. The expression of SCARB1 protein was found to be increased, whereas that of PPARG protein was decreased in eyelid SCs compared to that in the normal sebaceous glands. Increased SCARB1 and decreased PPARG indicated that dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism might be involved in carcinogenesis of eyelid SCs. The malfunction in cholesterol metabolism might advance our knowledge of the carcinogenesis of eyelid SCs.",2023,Humans; Transcriptome; Exome; Sebaceous Glands; PPAR gamma; Exome Sequencing; Eyelid Neoplasms; Eyelids; Carcinogenesis; Lipid Metabolism; Carcinoma; Cholesterol; Transcription Factors; Tumor Suppressor Proteins,14
36120553,PPARGC1A,10.3389/fmolb.2022.983840,Construction of a tumor immune infiltration macrophage signature for predicting prognosis and immunotherapy response in liver cancer.,"Liver cancer is an extraordinarily heterogeneous malignant disease. The tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the major drivers of liver cancer initiation and progression. It is critical to have a better understanding of the complicated interactions between liver cancer and the immune system for the development of cancer immunotherapy. Based on the gene expression profiles of tumor immune infiltration cells (TIICs), upregulated genes in TAMs and downregulated genes in other types of immune cells were identified as macrophage-specific genes (MSG). In this study, we combined MSG, immune subtypes, and clinical information on liver cancer to develop a tumor immune infiltration macrophage signature (TIMSig). A four-gene signature (S100A9, SLC22A15, TRIM54, and PPARGC1A) was identified as the TAM-related prognostic genes for liver cancer, independent of multiple clinicopathological parameters. Survival analyses showed that patients with low TIMSig had a superior survival rate than those with high TIMSig. Additionally, clinical immunotherapy response and TIMSig was observed as highly relevant. In addition, TIMSig could predict the response to chemotherapy. Collectively, the TIMSig could be a potential tool for risk-stratification, clinical decision making, treatment planning, and oncology immunotherapeutic drug development.",2022,immune infiltration; immunotherapy response; macrophage; prognosis; tumor microenvironment,14

However, drivers of exhaustion remain poorly understood. As intratumoral exhausted T cells experience severe hypoxia, we hypothesized that metabolic stress alters their responses to other signals, specifically, persistent antigenic stimulation. In vitro, although CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells experiencing continuous stimulation or hypoxia alone differentiated into functional effectors, the combination rapidly drove T cell dysfunction consistent with exhaustion. Continuous stimulation promoted Blimp-1-mediated repression of PGC-1&#x3b1;-dependent mitochondrial reprogramming, rendering cells poorly responsive to hypoxia. Loss of mitochondrial function generated intolerable levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), sufficient to promote exhausted-like states, in part through phosphatase inhibition and the consequent activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells. Reducing T cell-intrinsic ROS and lowering tumor hypoxia limited T cell exhaustion, synergizing with immunotherapy. Thus, immunologic and metabolic signaling are intrinsically linked: through mitigation of metabolic stress, T cell differentiation can be altered to promote more functional cellular fates.",2021,"Animals; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cell Line, Tumor; Coculture Techniques; Energy Metabolism; Female; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Lymphocyte Activation; Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating; Male; Melanoma, Experimental; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Mitochondria; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha; Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Tumor Hypoxia; Tumor Microenvironment",14
33266219,PPARGC1A,10.3390/ijms21239125,Cancer Stem Cell-Associated Pathways in the Metabolic Reprogramming of Breast Cancer.,"Metabolic reprogramming of cancer is now considered a hallmark of many malignant tumors, including breast cancer, which remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women all over the world. One of the main challenges for the effective treatment of breast cancer emanates from the existence of a subpopulation of tumor-initiating cells, known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Over the years, several pathways involved in the regulation of CSCs have been identified and characterized. Recent research has also shown that CSCs are capable of adopting a metabolic flexibility to survive under various stressors, contributing to chemo-resistance, metastasis, and disease relapse. This review summarizes the links between the metabolic adaptations of breast cancer cells and CSC-associated pathways. Identification of the drivers capable of the metabolic rewiring in breast cancer cells and CSCs and the signaling pathways contributing to metabolic flexibility may lead to the development of effective therapeutic strategies. This review also covers the role of these metabolic adaptation in conferring drug resistance and metastasis in breast CSCs.",2021,"breast cancer; cancer stem cells; metabolism; signaling pathways; Acyltransferases; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Biomarkers; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Cellular Reprogramming; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Janus Kinases; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; NF-kappa B; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha; STAT Transcription Factors; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors; YAP-Signaling Proteins",14

Defining which transcription factor (TF) and coregulators are altered and combine to become oncogenic drivers remains a challenge, in part because of the multitude of TFs and coregulators and the diverse genomic space on which they function. The current study was undertaken to identify which TFs and coregulators are commonly altered in PCa. We generated unique lists of TFs (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2662), coactivators (COA; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;766); corepressors (COR; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;599); mixed function coregulators (MIXED; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;511), and to address the challenge of defining how these genes are altered we tested how expression, copy number alterations and mutation status varied across seven prostate cancer (PCa) cohorts (three of localized and four advanced disease). Testing of significant changes was undertaken by bootstrapping approaches and the most significant changes were identified. For one commonly and significantly altered gene were stably knocked-down expression and undertook cell biology experiments and RNA-Seq to identify differentially altered gene networks and their association with PCa progression risks. COAS, CORS, MIXED and TFs all displayed significant down-regulated expression (q.value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.1) and correlated with protein expression (r 0.4-0.55). In localized PCa, stringent expression filtering identified commonly altered TFs and coregulator genes, including well-established (e.g. ERG) and underexplored (e.g. PPARGC1A, encodes PGC1&#x3b1;). Reduced PPARGC1A expression significantly associated with worse disease-free survival in two cohorts of localized PCa. Stable PGC1&#x3b1; knockdown in LNCaP cells increased growth rates and invasiveness and RNA-Seq revealed a profound basal impact on gene expression (~&#x2009;2300 genes; FDR&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05, logFC&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;1.5), but only modestly impacted PPAR&#x3b3; responses. GSEA analyses of the PGC1&#x3b1; transcriptome revealed that it significantly altered the AR-dependent transcriptome, and was enriched for epigenetic modifiers. PGC1&#x3b1;-dependent genes were overlapped with PGC1&#x3b1;-ChIP-Seq genes and significantly associated in TCGA with higher grade tumors and worse disease-free survival. These methods and data demonstrate an approach to identify cancer-driver coregulators in cancer, and that PGC1&#x3b1; expression is clinically significant yet underexplored coregulator in aggressive early stage PCa.",2021,"Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cohort Studies; Disease Progression; Disease-Free Survival; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Male; Mutation; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha; Prostatic Neoplasms; RNA-Seq; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome",14

Here, we showed that glioblastoma (GBM) cultures and patients' tumors harbored super-enhancers in several genes related to the Warburg effect. By conducting a transcriptome analysis followed by ChIP-Seq coupled with a comprehensive metabolite analysis in GBM models, we found that FDA-approved global (panobinostat, vorinostat) and selective (romidepsin) histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors elicited metabolic reprogramming in concert with disruption of several Warburg effect-related super-enhancers. Extracellular flux and carbon-tracing analyses revealed that HDAC inhibitors blunted glycolysis in a c-Myc-dependent manner and lowered ATP levels. This resulted in the engagement of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) driven by elevated fatty acid oxidation (FAO), rendering GBM cells dependent on these pathways. Mechanistically, interference with HDAC1/-2 elicited a suppression of c-Myc protein levels and a concomitant increase in 2 transcriptional drivers of oxidative metabolism, PGC1&#x3b1; and PPARD, suggesting an inverse relationship. Rescue and ChIP experiments indicated that c-Myc bound to the promoter regions of PGC1&#x3b1; and PPARD to counteract their upregulation driven by HDAC1/-2 inhibition. Finally, we demonstrated that combination treatment with HDAC and FAO inhibitors extended animal survival in patient-derived xenograft model systems in vivo more potently than single treatments in the absence of toxicity.",2021,Intermediary metabolism; Oncology; Animals; Cellular Reprogramming; Fatty Acids; Glioblastoma; Glycolysis; HCT116 Cells; Histone Deacetylase 1; Histone Deacetylase 2; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Humans; Mice; Oxidative Phosphorylation; PPAR delta; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Response Elements,14

This cannot be the sole cause and therefore it is important for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes to identify additional pathways. Comparative full transcriptome profile analysis of the hair bulb region of normal and miniaturized hair follicles from vertex and occipital region in males with and without androgenetic alopecia revealed that next to the androgen receptor as well the retinoid receptor and particularly the PPAR pathway is involved in progressive hair miniaturization. We demonstrate the concurrent up-regulation of PPARGC1a in the epithelial compartment and androgen receptor in the dermal papilla of miniaturized hair. Dynamic Ppargc1a expression in the mouse hair cycle suggests a possible role in regulating hair growth and differentiation. This is supported by reduced proliferation of human dermal papilla and predominantly epithelial keratinocytes after incubation with AICAR, the agonist for AMPK signaling which activates PPARGC1a and serves as co-activator of PPAR&#x3b3;. In addition, miRNA profiling shows enrichment of miRNA-targeted genes in retinoid receptors and PPARGC1&#x3b1;/PPAR&#x3b3; signaling, and antigen presentation pathways.",2020,"AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Alopecia; Aminoimidazole Carboxamide; Animals; Cell Line, Transformed; Gene Expression Regulation; Hair Follicle; Humans; Mice; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha; Ribonucleotides; Signal Transduction",14

Despite a significant focus on socioeconomic factors, recent findings strongly argue the existence of biological factors driving this disparity. Most of these factors have been described in a cancer-type specific context rather than a pan-cancer setting. A novel in silico approach based on Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) coupled to Transcription Factor enrichment was carried out to identify common biological drivers of pan-cancer racial disparity using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Mitochondrial content in patient tissues was examined using a multi-cancer tissue microarray approach (TMA). Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation was uniquely enriched in AA tumors compared to EA tumors across various cancer types. AA tumors also showed strong enrichment for the ERR1-PGC1&#x3b1;-mediated transcriptional program, which has been implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis. TMA analysis revealed that AA cancers harbor significantly more mitochondria compared to their EA counterparts. These findings highlight changes in mitochondria as a common distinguishing feature between AA and EA tumors in a pan-cancer setting, and provide the rationale for the repurposing of mitochondrial inhibitors to treat AA cancers.",2020,"Cancer; Metabolism; Oncology; Black or African American; Databases, Nucleic Acid; Female; Humans; Male; Mitochondria; Neoplasm Proteins; Neoplasms; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha; Receptors, Estrogen; Transcription, Genetic; White People",14

However, the specific driver mutations in cSCC remain unknown. Fusion genes in established cSCC cell lines (A431 and DJM-1) were predicted by transcriptome sequence, and validated by Sanger sequence, fluorescence in situ hybridization and G-banding. By transcriptome sequencing, we identified fusion gene EGFR-PPARGC1A in A431, which were expressed in 31 of 102 cSCCs. The lesions harboring the fusion gene tended to be located in sun-exposed areas. In vivo cutaneous implantation of EGFR-PPARGC1A-expressing NIH3T3 induced tumors resembling human cSCC, indicating its potent tumorigenicity. NIH3T3 transfected with EGFR-PPARGC1A as well as A431 showed increased cell proliferation activity. With regard to underlying mechanism, EGFR-PPARGC1A protein causes constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation, and induces the phosphorylation of wild-type full-length epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by dimerization. Conversely, the RNAi-mediated attenuation of EGFR or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown of the fusion gene in A431 led to a decrease in the cell number, and may have therapeutic value. Our findings advance the knowledge concerning genetic causes of cSCC and the function of EGFR, with potential implications for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",2019,"Animals; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; ErbB Receptors; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Mice; NIH 3T3 Cells; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha; Skin Neoplasms; Sunlight; Transcriptome",14
28969371,PPARGC1A,10.1093/brain/awx196,Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 activation sensitizes human glioma cells to hypoxia-induced cell death.,"Glioblastomas are characterized by fast uncontrolled growth leading to hypoxic areas and necrosis. Signalling from EGFR via mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a major driver of cell growth and proliferation and one of the most commonly altered signalling pathways in glioblastomas. Therefore, epidermal growth factor receptor and mTORC1 signalling are plausible therapeutic targets and clinical trials with inhibitors are in progress. However, we have previously shown that epidermal growth factor receptor and mTORC1 inhibition triggers metabolic changes leading to adverse effects under the conditions of the tumour microenvironment by protecting from hypoxia-induced cell death. We hypothesized that conversely mTORC1 activation sensitizes glioma cells to hypoxia-induced cell death. As a model for mTORC1 activation we used gene suppression of its physiological inhibitor TSC2 (TSC2sh). TSC2sh glioma cells showed increased sensitivity to hypoxia-induced cell death that was accompanied by an earlier ATP depletion and an increase in reactive oxygen species. There was no difference in extracellular glucose consumption but an altered intracellular metabolic profile with an increase of intermediates of the pentose phosphate pathway. Mechanistically, mTORC1 upregulated the first and rate limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, G6PD. Furthermore, an increase in oxygen consumption in TSC2sh cells was detected. This appeared to be due to higher transcription rates of genes involved in mitochondrial respiratory function including PPARGC1A and PPARGC1B (also known as PGC-1&#x3b1; and -&#x3b2;). The finding that mTORC1 activation causes an increase in oxygen consumption and renders malignant glioma cells susceptible to hypoxia and nutrient deprivation could help identify glioblastoma patient cohorts more likely to benefit from hypoxia-inducing therapies such as the VEGFA-targeting antibody bevacizumab in future clinical evaluations.",2017,"glioma; hypoxia; mTOR; oxygen; starvation; Cell Death; Cell Hypoxia; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA Modification Methylases; DNA Repair Enzymes; Glioma; Glucose; Humans; Isocitrate Dehydrogenase; Lactic Acid; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1; Multiprotein Complexes; Mutation; Oxygen Consumption; PTEN Phosphohydrolase; Reactive Oxygen Species; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Tumor Suppressor Proteins",14

Control of thermogenic gene expression occurs via the induction of various coactivators, most notably PGC-1&#x3b1;. In contrast, the transcription factor partner(s) of these cofactors are poorly described. Here, we identify interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) as a dominant transcriptional effector of thermogenesis. IRF4 is induced by cold and cAMP in adipocytes and is sufficient to promote increased thermogenic gene expression, energy expenditure, and cold tolerance. Conversely, knockout of IRF4 in UCP1(+) cells causes reduced thermogenic gene expression and energy expenditure, obesity, and cold intolerance. IRF4 also induces the expression of PGC-1&#x3b1; and PRDM16 and interacts with PGC-1&#x3b1;, driving Ucp1 expression. Finally, cold, &#x3b2;-agonists, or forced expression of PGC-1&#x3b1; are unable to cause thermogenic gene expression in the absence of IRF4.

To conduct a comprehensive synthesis and analysis of SCC sequencing studies with individual patient-level data, a comprehensive literature search was performed. Statistical analyses were performed to identify trends. Studies meeting inclusion criteria included a total of 279 patients (189 localized SCCs, 90 metastatic SCCs). Several mutations were correlated with demographic characteristics (TP53, MLL4, BRCA2, COL4A1).

However, MHT therapies were controversial with the increased risk of breast cancer because of different estrogen and progestogen combinations, and the molecular basis behind this phenomenon is currently not understood. To address this issue, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the estrogen plus progestogens treatment (EPT) and estrogen treatment (ET) using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. As a result, a total of 96 upregulated DEGs were first identified. Seven DEGs related to the cell cycle (CCNE2, CDCA5, RAD51, TCF19, KNTC1, MCM10, and NEIL3) were validated by RT-qPCR. Specifically, these seven DEGs were increased in EPT compared to ET (p &lt; 0.05) and had higher expression levels in breast cancer than adjacent normal tissues (p &lt; 0.05). Next, we found that estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients with a higher CNNE2 expression have a shorter overall survival time (p &lt; 0.05), while this effect was not observed in the other six DEGs (p &gt; 0.05). Interestingly, the molecular docking results showed that CCNE2 might bind to 17&#x3b2;-estradiol (&#x2212;6.791 kcal/mol), progesterone (&#x2212;6.847 kcal/mol), and medroxyprogesterone acetate (&#x2212;6.314 kcal/mol) with a relatively strong binding affinity, respectively. Importantly, CNNE2 protein level could be upregulated with EPT and attenuated by estrogen receptor antagonist, acolbifene and had interactions with cancer driver genes (AKT1 and KRAS) and high mutation frequency gene (TP53 and PTEN) in breast cancer patients. In conclusion, the current study showed that CCNE2, CDCA5, RAD51, TCF19, KNTC1, MCM10, and NEIL3 might contribute to EPT-related tumorigenesis in breast cancer, with CCNE2 might be a sensitive risk indicator of breast cancer risk in women using MHT.",2022,"bioinformatic analysis; breast cancer; estrogen plus progestogens treatment; menopausal hormone therapy; Breast Neoplasms; Computational Biology; Estradiol; Estrogen Receptor Antagonists; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Estrogens; Female; Humans; Medroxyprogesterone Acetate; Menopause; Molecular Docking Simulation; Progesterone; Progestins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Receptors, Estrogen; Transcription Factors",1
