36130908,VWF,10.1111/ejh.13866,von Willebrand factor activity levels are influenced by driver mutation status in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia patients with well-controlled platelet counts.,"von Willebrand factor ristocetin cofactor (vWF activity) and platelet count (PLT) are negatively correlated in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). However, vWF activity does not always normalize upon controlling PLT in those patients. To address this issue, we investigated the correlation between vWF activity and PLT in PV and ET patients. The negative correlation between vWF activity and PLT was stronger in calreticulin mutation-positive (CALR+) ET than in Janus kinase 2 mutation-positive (JAK2+) PV or ET groups. When PLT were maintained at a certain level (&lt;600&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10<sup>9</sup> /L), low vWF activity (&lt;50%) was more frequently observed in JAK2+ PV patients than in JAK2+ ET (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.013) or CALR+ ET (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.013) groups, and in PV and ET patients with &#x2265;50% JAK2+ allele burden than in those with allele burden &lt;50% (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.015). High vWF activity (&gt;150%) was more frequent in the JAK2+ ET group than in the CALR+ ET group (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.005), and often associated with vasomotor symptoms (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.002). This study suggests that some patients with JAK2+ PV or ET have vWF activity outside the standard range even with well-controlled PLT, and that the measurement of vWF activity is useful for assessing the risk of thrombosis and hemorrhage.",2022,"CALR; JAK2V617F; JAK2V617F allele burden; essential thrombocythemia; polycythemia vera; von Willebrand factor activity; Humans; Thrombocythemia, Essential; Polycythemia Vera; von Willebrand Factor; Platelet Count; Calreticulin; Janus Kinase 2; Mutation",5

Herein, our study aimed to identify significant genes with poor outcome and underlying mechanisms in NSCLC using bioinformatics analyses. Gene expression profiles (GSE33532, GSE19188, GSE102287, GSE27262), including 319 NSCLC and 232 adjacent lung tissues, were downloaded from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the GEO2R online tool. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed via the DAVID database. The protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of these DEGs were constructed by the STRING website and visualized by the Cytoscape software platform. The expression of hub genes in NSCLC was validated through the GEPIA database. Kaplan-Meier plotter was used to analyse the survival rate with multivariate Cox regression. The expression of protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2) in NSCLC and adjacent lung tissues was evaluated on the UALCAN database platform. A total of 225 significant DEGs were obtained between NSCLC and adjacent lung tissues, containing 52 upregulated genes and 173 downregulated genes. The DEGs were clustered based on functions and signaling pathways that may be closely associated with NSCLC occurrence. A total of 174 DEGs were identified from the PPI network complex. Top 10 hub genes were selected by CytoHubba plugin. As independent predictors, seven genes (<i>COL1A1, ADAM12, VWF, OGN, EDN1, CAV1, ITGA8</i>) were associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC via multivariate Cox regression (P&lt;0.01). Four genes (<i>VWF, CAV1, ITGA8, COL1A1</i>) were found to be significantly enriched in the focal adhesion pathway (P=1.04E-04) and to be upstream regulators of PTK2. PTK2 was upregulated in NSCLC and associated with poor survival prognosis in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Taken together, the important genes and pathways in NSCLC were identified by using integrated bioinformatics analysis. PTK2 could be a key gene associated with the biological process of NSCLC formation and progression and a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment.",2022,Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); bioinformatics; differentially expressed genes (DEGs),5
34995576,VWF,10.1016/j.amjms.2021.12.008,Comprehensive analysis of the exocytosis pathway genes in cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth most common gynecological malignancy globally. This suggests the need for improved markers for prognosis, better understanding of the molecular mechanism, and targets for therapy. The defective exocytosis pathway is proposed as bona fide drivers of carcinogenesis. This study aimed to identify the exocytosis pathway network and its contribution to CC. We screened exocytosis genes from the The Cancer Genome Atlas Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-CESC) dataset and performed differential expression and methylation, Kaplan-Meier survival, and pathway enrichment analysis. We constructed the protein-protein interaction networks (PPIN), predicted the possible metastatic genes, and identified FDA approved drugs to target the exocytosis network in CC. Integrated bioinformatics analysis identified 245 differentially methylated genes, including 153 hypermethylated and 92 hypomethylated genes. Further, 89 exocytosis pathway genes were differentially expressed, including 60 downregulated and 29 upregulated genes in CC. The overlapping analysis identified 39 genes as methylation regulated genes and showed an inverse correlation between methylation and expression. The HCMDB database identified nine of the identified genes (GRIK5, PTPN6, GAB2, ATP8B4, HTR2A, SPARC, CLEC3B, VWF, and S100A11) were linked with metastasis in CC. Moreover, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis identified that high expression of PTPN6 and low expression of CLEC3B were significantly linked with poor overall survival (OS) in patients with CC. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis identified differentially expressed genes that were mainly involved with proteoglycans in cancer, TGF-beta signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, MAPK signaling pathway, and others. The PPIN identified 89 nodes, 192 edges with VWF, MMP9, THBS1, IGF1, CLU, A2M, IGF2, SPARC, VAMP2, and FIGF as top 10 hub genes. The drug-gene interaction analysis identified 188 FDA approved drugs targeting 32 genes, including 5 drugs that are already in use for treating CC. In summary, we have identified the exocytosis pathway networks, candidate genes, and novel drugs for better management of CC.",2022,"Bioinformatics analysis; Cervical cancer; Drug targets; Exocytosis; Overall survival; Biomarkers, Tumor; Exocytosis; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; von Willebrand Factor",5
27919526,VWF,10.1016/j.ejim.2016.11.011,Factors related to the development of acquired von Willebrand syndrome in patients with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera.,"We characterized acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) among essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) patients. A review of patients with ET or PV evaluated for AVWS. Of 116 patients with ET, 64 (55%) developed AVWS; of 57 with PV, 28 (49%) developed AVWS. Median platelet counts of ET and PV patients who developed AVWS were 920&#xd7;10<sup>9</sup>/L and 679&#xd7;10<sup>9</sup>/L, respectively (P=0.01). Of patients who developed AVWS, 69.5% had platelet counts below 1000&#xd7;10<sup>9</sup>/L. Bleeding was more common in patients with AVWS, among both ET and PV patients (P&lt;0.001). VWF:RCo levels and VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag ratio were lower among JAK2 V617F positive- vs. JAK2 V617F negative- ET patients (P=0.02 and P=0.002, respectively); whereas VWF:Ag levels were comparable (P=0.96). ET patients harboring the JAK2 V617F mutation were more likely to develop AVWS than were calreticulin-positive patients (70.3% vs. 45.7%, P=0.02), despite lower platelet counts (median 773 vs. 920&#xd7;10<sup>9</sup>/L, P=0.05). In multivariable analysis, younger age (P=0.002), platelet count (P&lt;0.001), hemoglobin level (P=0.01) and JAK2 V617F mutation (P=0.01) independently predicted the development of AVWS among ET patients; whereas only platelet count predicted its development among PV patients (P&lt;0.001). Among ET and PV patients, AVWS was common and associated with higher bleeding rates and higher platelet count; nonetheless, most AVWS patients had platelet counts under 1000&#xd7;10<sup>9</sup>/L. Thus, AVWS screening should be included in routine assessment of ET and PV patients. Among ET patients, JAK2 V617F was a main driver for the development of AVWS.",2018,"Acquired von Willebrand syndrome; Essential thrombocythemia; JAK2 V617F; Myeloproliferative neoplasms; Polycythemia vera; Adult; Aged; Calreticulin; Female; Hemorrhage; Humans; Israel; Janus Kinase 2; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Mutation; Platelet Count; Polycythemia Vera; Regression Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Thrombocythemia, Essential; von Willebrand Diseases; von Willebrand Factor",5
26427513,VWF,10.1038/cgt.2015.48,Integrated analysis of gene expression and genomic aberration data in osteosarcoma (OS).,"Cytogenetic analyses have revealed that complex karyotypes with numerous and highly variable genomic aberrations including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs), are observed in most of the conventional osteosarcomas (OSs). Several genome-wide studies have reported that the dysregulated expression of many genes is correlated with genomic aberrations in OS. We first compared OS gene expression in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets and genomic aberrations in International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with SNPs or CNVs in OS. Then the function annotation of SNP- or CNV-associated DEGs was performed in terms of gene ontology analysis, pathway analysis and protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Finally, the expression of genes correlated with both SNPs and CNVs were confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. Eight publicly available GEO data sets were obtained, and a set of 979 DEGs were identified (472 upregulated and 507 downregulated DEGs). Moreover, we obtained 1039 SNPs mapped in 938 genes, and 583 CNV sites mapped in 2915 genes. Comparing genomic aberrations and DGEs, we found 41 SNP-associated DEGs and 124 CNV-associated DEGs, in which 7 DGEs were associated with both SNPs and CNVs, including WWP1, EXT1, LDHB, C8orf59, PLEKHA5, CCT3 and VWF. The result of function annotation showed that ossification, bone development and skeletal system development were the significantly enriched terms of biological processes for DEGs. PPI network analysis showed that CCT3, COPS3 and WWP1 were the significant hub proteins. We conclude that these genes, including CCT3, COPS3 and WWP1 are candidate driver genes of importance in OS tumorigenesis.",2016,"Bone Neoplasms; Chromosome Aberrations; DNA Copy Number Variations; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genomics; Humans; Osteosarcoma; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prognosis; Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Interaction Maps; Signal Transduction",5
36439433,EPAS1,10.3389/fonc.2022.1045517,PD-L1 expression and association with genetic background in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.,"Metastatic pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors associated with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Recent advances in oncology-related immunotherapy, specifically in targeting of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathways, have identified a new treatment potential in a variety of tumors, including advanced and rare tumors. Only a fraction of patients being treated by immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown to benefit from it, displaying a need for strategies which identify patients who may most likely show a favorable response. Building on recent, promising outcomes in a clinical study of metastatic PPGL using pembrolizumab, a humanized IgG4&#x3ba; monoclonal antibody targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, we examined PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in relation to oncogenic drivers in our PPGL patient cohort to explore whether expression can predict metastatic potential and/or be considered a predictive marker for targeted therapy. We evaluated RNA expression in the NIH cohort of 48 patients with known genetic predisposition (sporadic; pseudohypoxia: <i>SDHB</i>, <i>VHL</i>, <i>EPAS1</i>, <i>EGLN1;</i> kinase signaling: <i>RET</i>, <i>NF1</i>) and 6 normal medulla samples (NAM). For comparison, 72 PPGL samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used for analysis of gene expression based on the variant status (pseudohypoxia: <i>SDHB</i>, <i>VHL</i>, <i>EPAS1</i>, <i>EGLN1</i>; kinase signaling: <i>NF1</i>, <i>RET</i>). Expression of PD-L1 was elevated in the PPGL cohort compared to normal adrenal medulla, aligning with the TCGA analysis, whereas PD-L2 was not elevated. However, expression of PD-L1 was lower in the pseudohypoxia cluster compared to the sporadic and the kinase signaling subtype cluster, suggesting that sporadic and kinase signaling cluster PPGLs could benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 therapy more than the pseudohypoxia cluster. Within the pseudohypoxia cluster, expression of PD-L1 was significantly lower in both <i>SDHB</i>- and non-<i>SDHB</i>-mutated tumors compared to sporadic tumors. PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression was not affected by the metastatic status. We conclude that PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in our cohort of PPGL tumors was not linked to metastatic behavior, however, the presence of PPGL driver mutation could be a predictive marker for PD-L1-targeted therapy and an important feature for further clinical studies in patients with PPGL.",2022,immunotherapy; neuroendocrine tumors; paraganglioma; pheochromocytoma; programmed death ligand 1,15

To determine the prevalence of somatic IDH1 hotspot variants in a large cohort of Chinese patients with PPGLs and to summarize associated phenotypes. This retrospective cross-sectional study was based on a main cohort of 1141 patients with PPGLs from 2 tertiary-care centers in China. We included 50 cases with urinary bladder paragangliomas (UBPGLs), of whom 29 were part of the main cohort and 21 were from other centers. Two additional cases with IDH1 hotspot variants not part of the main cohort were also included for summarizing IDH1-associated phenotypes. Next-generation sequencing of tumor DNA was used to analyze a customized panel of genes. The overall prevalence of IDH1 hotspot variants in the main cohort was 0.5% (6/1141). Among those PPGLs without mutations in 15 common driver genes, the prevalence of IDH1 variants was 0.9% (4/455). When restricted to paraganglioma (PGL) without mutations, the prevalence reached 4.7% (4/86). Among UBPGLs, IDH1 hotspot variants accounted for 8% (4/50). Together, all 10 patients (9 PGLs and 1 pheochromocytoma) with IDH1 hotspot variants, including 3 females with concurrent EPAS1 hotspot variants, had apparently sporadic tumors, without metastasis or recurrence. There were 3 patients with biochemical data, all showing a non-adrenergic phenotype. The somatic IDH1 hotspot variants cause PPGL development in some Chinese patients, especially among those apparently sporadic PGLs with a non-adrenergic phenotype and without mutations in major PPGL driver genes.",2023, IDH1 ; paraganglioma; pheochromocytoma; Female; Humans; Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; East Asian People; Isocitrate Dehydrogenase; Paraganglioma; Pheochromocytoma; Retrospective Studies,15

Their remarkable genetic diversity and high heritability have enabled discoveries of bona fide cancer driver genes with an impact on diagnosis and clinical management and have consistently shed light on new paradigms in cancer. In this review, we explore unique mechanisms of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma initiation and management by drawing from recent examples involving rare mutations of hypoxia-related genes <i>VHL, EPAS1</i> and <i>SDHB</i>, and of a poorly known susceptibility gene, <i>TMEM127.</i> These models expand our ability to predict variant pathogenicity, inform new functional domains, recognize environmental-gene connections, and highlight persistent therapeutic challenges for tumors with aggressive behavior.",2022,RNAseq; driver mutations; environment; germline; hereditary; metastatic; mutations; next generation sequencing; paragangliomas; pheochromocytomas; somatic; susceptibility genes; treatment; tumor suppressor genes; variants,15
34147030,EPAS1,10.1210/endrev/bnab019,Personalized Management of Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma.,"Pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas are characterized by a unique molecular landscape that allows their assignment to clusters based on underlying genetic alterations. With around 30% to 35% of Caucasian patients (a lower percentage in the Chinese population) showing germline mutations in susceptibility genes, pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas have the highest rate of heritability among all tumors. A further 35% to 40% of Caucasian patients (a higher percentage in the Chinese population) are affected by somatic driver mutations. Thus, around 70% of all patients with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma can be assigned to 1 of 3 main molecular clusters with different phenotypes and clinical behavior. Krebs cycle/VHL/EPAS1-related cluster 1 tumors tend to a noradrenergic biochemical phenotype and require very close follow-up due to the risk of metastasis and recurrence. In contrast, kinase signaling-related cluster 2 tumors are characterized by an adrenergic phenotype and episodic symptoms, with generally a less aggressive course. The clinical correlates of patients with Wnt signaling-related cluster 3 tumors are currently poorly described, but aggressive behavior seems likely. In this review, we explore and explain why cluster-specific (personalized) management of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma is essential to ascertain clinical behavior and prognosis, guide individual diagnostic procedures (biochemical interpretation, choice of the most sensitive imaging modalities), and provide personalized management and follow-up. Although cluster-specific therapy of inoperable/metastatic disease has not yet entered routine clinical practice, we suggest that informed personalized genetic-driven treatment should be implemented as a logical next step.

Germline pathogenic variants (PVs) are found in up to 40% of those with PCC/PGL. Tumors with germline PVs are broadly categorized as Cluster 1 (pseudohypoxia), including those with SDH, VHL, FH, and EPAS1 PVs, or Cluster 2 (kinase signaling) including those with NF1, RET, TMEM127, and MAX PVs. Somatic driver mutations exist in some of the same genes (RET, VHL, NF1, EPAS1) as well as in additional genes including HRAS, CSDE1 and genes involved in cell immortalization (ATRX and TERT). Other somatic driver events include recurrent fusion genes involving MAML3. PCC/PGL have the highest association with germline PVs of all human solid tumors. Expanding our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of PCC/PGL is essential to advancements in diagnosis and surveillance and the development of novel therapies for these unique tumors.",2021,Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Mutation; Paraganglioma; Pheochromocytoma; Signal Transduction,15
31234811,EPAS1,10.1186/s12885-019-5813-z,"Master regulator analysis of paragangliomas carrying SDHx, VHL, or MAML3 genetic alterations.","Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) loss and mastermind-like 3 (MAML3) translocation are two clinically important genetic alterations that correlate with increased rates of metastasis in subtypes of human paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma (PPGL) neuroendocrine tumors. Although hypotheses propose that succinate accumulation after SDH loss poisons dioxygenases and activates pseudohypoxia and epigenomic hypermethylation, it remains unclear whether these mechanisms account for oncogenic transcriptional patterns. Additionally, MAML3 translocation has recently been identified as a genetic alteration in PPGL, but is poorly understood. We hypothesize that a key to understanding tumorigenesis driven by these genetic alterations is identification of the transcription factors responsible for the observed oncogenic transcriptional changes. We leverage publicly-available human tumor gene expression profiling experiments (N&#xa0;=&#x2009;179) to reconstruct a PPGL tumor-specific transcriptional network. We subsequently use the inferred transcriptional network to perform master regulator analyses nominating transcription factors predicted to control oncogenic transcription in specific PPGL molecular subtypes. Results are validated by analysis of an independent collection of PPGL tumor specimens (N&#xa0;=&#x2009;188). We then perform a similar master regulator analysis in SDH-loss mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to infer aspects of SDH loss master regulator response conserved across species and tissue types. A small number of master regulator transcription factors are predicted to drive the observed subtype-specific gene expression patterns in SDH loss and MAML3 translocation-positive PPGL. Interestingly, although EPAS1 perturbation is detectible in SDH-loss and VHL-loss tumors, it is by no means the most potent factor driving observed patterns of transcriptional dysregulation. Analysis of conserved SDH-loss master regulators in human tumors and MEFs implicated ZNF423, a known modulator of retinoic acid response in neuroblastoma. Subsequent functional analysis revealed a blunted cell death response to retinoic acid in SDH-loss MEFs and blunted differentiation response in SDH-inhibited SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The unbiased analyses presented here nominate specific transcription factors that are likely drivers of oncogenic transcription in PPGL tumors. This information has the potential to be exploited for targeted therapy. Additionally, the observation that SDH loss or inhibition results in blunted retinoic acid response suggests a potential developmental etiology for this tumor subtype.",2019,"Mastermind-like transcriptional coactivator 3; Paraganglioma; Pheochromocytoma; Retinoic acid; Succinate dehydrogenase; Transcription factor; Transcriptional network; von Hippel-Lindau; Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Algorithms; Animals; Cells, Cultured; DNA-Binding Proteins; Databases, Genetic; Fibroblasts; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Mutation; Pheochromocytoma; Succinate Dehydrogenase; Trans-Activators; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Translocation, Genetic; Tretinoin; Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein",15

A pseudohypoxic transcriptional signature characterizes pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) of the cluster I, mainly represented by tumors with mutations in von Hippel-Lindau (<i>VHL</i>), endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1 (<i>EPAS1</i>), or succinate dehydrogenase (<i>SDH</i>) subunit genes. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between underlying tumor driver mutations and COX-2 in PPGLs. <i>COX-2</i> gene expression and immunoreactivity were examined in clinical specimens with documented mutations, as well as in spheroids and allografts derived from mouse pheochromocytoma (MPC) cells. COX-2 in vivo imaging was performed in allograft mice. We observed significantly higher <i>COX-2</i> expression in cluster I, especially in <i>VHL</i>-mutant PPGLs, however, no specific association between <i>COX-2</i> mRNA levels and a hypoxia-related transcriptional signature was found. COX-2 immunoreactivity was present in about 60% of clinical specimens as well as in MPC spheroids and allografts. A selective COX-2 tracer specifically accumulated in MPC allografts. This study demonstrates that, although pseudohypoxia is not the major determinant for high COX-2 levels in PPGLs, COX-2 is a relevant molecular target. This potentially allows for employing selective COX-2 inhibitors as targeted chemotherapeutic agents and radiosensitizers.

Approximately 40% of PPGLs are caused by driver germline mutations in 16 known susceptibility genes, and approximately half of these genes encode members of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Taking as a starting point the involvement of the TCA cycle in PPGL development, we aimed to identify unreported mutations that occurred in genes involved in this key metabolic pathway and that could explain the phenotypes of additional individuals who lack mutations in known susceptibility genes. To accomplish this, we applied a targeted sequencing of 37 TCA-cycle-related genes to DNA from 104 PPGL-affected individuals with no mutations in the major known predisposing genes. We also performed omics-based analyses, TCA-related metabolite determination, and&#xa0;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-glutamate labeling assays. We identified five germline variants affecting DLST in eight unrelated individuals (&#x223c;7%); all except one were diagnosed with multiple PPGLs. A recurrent variant, c.1121G&gt;A (p.Gly374Glu), found in four of the eight individuals triggered accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate, both in tumors and in a heterologous cell-based assay designed to functionally evaluate DLST variants. p.Gly374Glu-DLST tumors exhibited loss of heterozygosity, and their methylation and expression profiles are similar to those of EPAS1-mutated PPGLs; this similarity suggests a link between DLST disruption and pseudohypoxia. Moreover, we found positive DLST immunostaining exclusively in tumors carrying TCA-cycle or EPAS1 mutations. In summary, this study reveals DLST as a PPGL-susceptibility gene and further strengthens the relevance of the TCA cycle in PPGL development.",2020,DLST; TCA cycle; cancer susceptibility gene; paraganglioma; pheochromocytoma; Acyltransferases; Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Adult; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Carcinogenesis; Catalytic Domain; Citric Acid Cycle; DNA Methylation; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Germ-Line Mutation; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Loss of Heterozygosity; Male; Middle Aged; Paraganglioma; Pheochromocytoma,15

Whether such categorizations are independent factors for prognosis or metastatic disease is unknown. We performed a systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis aiming to estimate if driver mutation status can predict metastatic disease and survival. Driver mutations were used to categorize patients according to three different molecular systems: two subgroups (SDHB mutated or wild type), three subgroups (pseudohypoxia, kinase signaling or Wnt/unknown) and four subgroups (tricarboxylic acid cycle, VHL/EPAS1, kinase signaling or Wnt/unknown). Twenty-one studies and 703 patients were analyzed. Multivariate models for association with metastasis showed correlation with SDHB mutation (OR 5.68 (95% CI 1.79-18.06)) as well as norepinephrine (OR 3.01 (95% CI 1.02-8.79)) and dopamine (OR 6.39 (95% CI 1.62-25.24)) but not to PPGL location. Other molecular systems were not associated with metastasis. In multivariate models for association with survival, age (HR 1.04 (95% CI 1.02-1.06)) and metastases (HR 6.13 (95% CI 2.86-13.13)) but neither paraganglioma nor SDHB mutation remained significant. Other molecular subgroups did not correlate with survival. We conclude that molecular categorization accordingly to SDHB provided independent information on the risk of metastasis. Driver mutations status did not correlate independently with survival.

29505958,EPAS1,10.1016/j.neo.2018.01.009,Wnt Signalling Drives Context-Dependent Differentiation or Proliferation in Neuroblastoma.,"Neuroblastoma is one of the commonest and deadliest solid tumours of childhood, and is thought to result from disrupted differentiation of the developing sympathoadrenergic lineage of the neural crest. Neuroblastoma exhibits intra- and intertumoural heterogeneity, with high risk tumours characterised by poor differentiation, which can be attributable to MYCN-mediated repression of genes involved in neuronal differentiation. MYCN is known to co-operate with oncogenic signalling pathways such as Alk, Akt and MEK/ERK signalling, and, together with c-MYC has been shown to be activated by Wnt signalling in various tissues. However, our previous work demonstrated that Wnt3a/Rspo2 treatment of some neuroblastoma cell lines can, paradoxically, decrease c-MYC and MYCN proteins. This prompted us to define the neuroblastoma-specific Wnt3a/Rspo2-driven transcriptome using RNA sequencing, and characterise the accompanying changes in cell biology. Here we report the identification of ninety Wnt target genes, and show that Wnt signalling is upstream of numerous transcription factors and signalling pathways in neuroblastoma. Using live-cell imaging, we show that Wnt signalling can drive differentiation of SK-N-BE(2)-C and SH-SY5Y cell-lines, but, conversely, proliferation of SK-N-AS cells. We show that cell-lines that differentiate show induction of pro-differentiation BMP4 and EPAS1 proteins, which is not apparent in the SK-N-AS cells. In contrast, SK-N-AS cells show increased CCND1, phosphorylated RB and E2F1 in response to Wnt3a/Rspo2, consistent with their proliferative response, and these proteins are not increased in differentiating lines. By meta-analysis of the expression of our 90 genes in primary tumour gene expression databases, we demonstrate discrete expression patterns of our Wnt genes in patient cohorts with different prognosis. Furthermore our analysis reveals interconnectivity within subsets of our Wnt genes, with one subset comprised of novel putative drivers of neuronal differentiation repressed by MYCN. Assessment of &#x3b2;-catenin immunohistochemistry shows high levels of &#x3b2;-catenin in tumours with better differentiation, further supporting a role for canonical Wnt signalling in neuroblastoma differentiation.",2018,"Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, myc; Humans; N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein; Neuroblastoma; Nuclear Proteins; Oncogene Proteins; Wnt Proteins; Wnt Signaling Pathway",15
28667082,EPAS1,10.1530/ERC-16-0479,New HIF2&#x3b1; inhibitors: potential implications as therapeutics for advanced pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.,"Two recent independent studies published in <i>Nature</i> show robust responses of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines, preclinical ccRCC xenograft models and, remarkably, a patient with progressive ccRCC despite receiving multiple lines of treatment, to the long-awaited, recently developed inhibitors of hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha (HIF2&#x3b1;). This commentary published in <i>Endocrine-Related Cancer</i> is based on the recognition of similar molecular drivers in ccRCC and the endocrine neoplasias pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs), ultimately leading to stabilization of HIFs. HIF-stabilizing mutations have been detected in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene, as well as in other genes, such as succinate dehydrogenase (SDHx), fumarate hydratase (FH) and transcription elongation factor B subunit 1 (TCEB1), as well as the gene that encodes HIF2&#x3b1; itself: EPAS1<sup>HIF2&#x3b1;</sup> Importantly, the recent discovery of <i>EPAS1</i> mutations in PPGLs and the results of comprehensive <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies revealing their oncogenic roles characterized a hitherto unknown direct mechanism of HIF2&#x3b1; activation in human cancer. The now available therapeutic opportunity to successfully inhibit HIF2&#x3b1; pharmacologically with PT2385 and PT2399 will certainly spearhead a series of investigations in several types of cancers, including patients with <i>SDHB</i>-related metastatic PPGL for whom limited therapeutic options are currently available. Future studies will determine the efficacy of these promising drugs against the hotspot <i>EPAS1</i> mutations affecting HIF2&#x3b1; amino acids 529-532 (in PPGLs) and amino acids 533-540 (in erythrocytosis type 4), as well as against HIF2&#x3b1; protein activated by <i>VHL</i>, <i>SDHx</i> and <i>FH</i> mutations in PPGL-derived chromatin cells.",2018,"EPAS1; HIF; HIF2; PT2385; PT2399; hypoxia; hypoxia-inducible factor; kidney carcinoma; paraganglioma; pheochromocytoma; renal carcinoma; Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Humans; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Paraganglioma; Pheochromocytoma",15
28233034,EPAS1,10.1007/s00109-017-1519-3,Gain-of-function EGLN1 prolyl hydroxylase (PHD2 D4E:C127S) in combination with EPAS1 (HIF-2&#x3b1;) polymorphism lowers hemoglobin concentration in Tibetan highlanders.,"Tibetans have lived at high altitude for generations and are thought to be genetically adapted to hypoxic environments. Most are protected from hypoxia-induced polycythemia, and a haplotype of EPAS1, encoding hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-2&#x3b1;), has been associated with lower hemoglobin levels. We earlier reported a Tibetan-specific EGLN1 haplotype encoding PHD2 which abrogates HIF augmentation in hypoxia. We genotyped 347 Tibetan individuals from varying altitudes for both the Tibetan-specific EGLN1 haplotype and 10 candidate SNPs in the EPAS1 haplotype and correlated their association with hemoglobin levels. The effect of the EGLN1 haplotype on hemoglobin exhibited age dependency at low altitude, while at higher altitudes, it showed a trend to lower hemoglobin levels in the presence of the Tibetan-selected EPAS1 rs142764723 C/C allele. The observed gene-environment and gene-gene interactions and the moderate effect of the EGLN1 and EPAS1 haplotypes on hemoglobin indicate that other modifiers exist. It remains to be determined whether a blunting of erythropoiesis or other physiological consequences of HIF downregulation are the primary drivers of these genetic adaptations among Tibetans. Most Tibetans are protected from polycythemia while living in high altitude. An EGLN1 co-adapted haplotype, EGLN1 c.12C&gt;G, c.380G&gt;C is uniquely Tibetan. The Tibetan EPAS1 haplotype has introgressed from the Denisovan genome. While EGLN1 and EPAS1 genotypes lower Hb, this study indicates additional Hb modifiers.",2018,"Genetic adaptation; High altitude; High-resolution melting assay; Hypoxia; Polycythemia; Acclimatization; Adult; Altitude; Asian People; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Erythropoietin; Female; Ferritins; Gene-Environment Interaction; Haplotypes; Hemoglobins; Humans; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-Proline Dioxygenases; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Tibet",15
28162975,EPAS1,10.1016/j.ccell.2017.01.001,Comprehensive Molecular Characterization of Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma.,"We report a comprehensive molecular characterization of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PCCs/PGLs), a rare tumor type. Multi-platform integration revealed that PCCs/PGLs are driven by diverse alterations affecting multiple genes and pathways. Pathogenic germline mutations occurred in eight PCC/PGL susceptibility genes. We identified CSDE1 as a somatically mutated driver gene, complementing four known drivers (HRAS, RET, EPAS1, and NF1). We also discovered fusion genes in PCCs/PGLs, involving MAML3, BRAF, NGFR, and NF1. Integrated analysis classified PCCs/PGLs into four molecularly defined groups: a kinase signaling subtype, a pseudohypoxia subtype, a Wnt-altered subtype, driven by MAML3 and CSDE1, and a cortical admixture subtype. Correlates of metastatic PCCs/PGLs included the MAML3 fusion gene. This integrated molecular characterization provides a comprehensive foundation for developing PCC/PGL precision medicine.",2017,"CSDE1; MAML3; TCGA; expression subtypes; genomics; metastasis; molecular profiling; paraganglioma; pheochromocytoma; sequencing; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Gene Fusion; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Nuclear Proteins; Paraganglioma; Pheochromocytoma; Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret; RNA-Binding Proteins; Trans-Activators; Transcription Factors",15

23418310,EPAS1,10.1093/hmg/ddt069,Tumoral EPAS1 (HIF2A) mutations explain sporadic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma in the absence of erythrocytosis.,"Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) are chromaffin-cell tumors that arise from the adrenal medulla and extra-adrenal paraganglia, respectively. The dysfunction of genes involved in the cellular response to hypoxia, such as VHL, EGL nine homolog 1, and the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) genes, leads to a direct abrogation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) degradation, resulting in a pseudo-hypoxic state implicated in PCC/PGL development. Recently, somatic post-zygotic mutations in EPAS1 (HIF2A) have been found in patients with multiple PGLs and congenital erythrocytosis. We assessed 41 PCCs/PGLs for mutations in EPAS1 and herein describe the clinical, molecular and genetic characteristics of the 7 patients found to carry somatic EPAS1 mutations; 4 presented with multiple PGLs (3 of them also had congenital erythrocytosis), whereas 3 were single sporadic PCC/PGL cases. Gene expression analysis of EPAS1-mutated tumors revealed similar mRNA EPAS1 levels to those found in SDH-gene- and VHL-mutated cases and a significant up-regulation of two hypoxia-induced genes (PCSK6 and GNA14). Interestingly, single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis revealed an exclusive gain of chromosome 2p in three EPAS1-mutated tumors. Furthermore, multiplex-PCR screening for small rearrangements detected a specific EPAS1 gain in another EPAS1-mutated tumor and in three non-EPAS1-mutated cases. The finding that EPAS1 is involved in the sporadic presentation of the disease not only increases the percentage of PCCs/PGLs with known driver mutations, but also highlights the relevance of studying other hypoxia-related genes in apparently sporadic tumors. Finally, the detection of a specific copy number alteration affecting chromosome 2p in EPAS1-mutated tumors may guide the genetic diagnosis of patients with this disease.",2013,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Amino Acid Sequence; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Chromosome Aberrations; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Hypoxia; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Paraganglioma, Extra-Adrenal; Pheochromocytoma; Polycythemia; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Young Adult",15

Their role in breast cancer, however, remains largely underappreciated due to the complexity of genomic rearrangements in breast malignancy. Just recently, we and others have identified several recurrent gene fusions in breast cancer with important clinical and biological implications. Examples of the most significant recurrent gene fusions to date include (1) ESR1::CCDC170 gene fusions in luminal B and endocrine-resistant breast cancer that exert oncogenic function via modulating the HER2/HER3/SRC Proto-Oncogene (SRC) complex, (2) ESR1 exon 6 fusions in metastatic disease that drive estrogen-independent estrogen-receptor transcriptional activity, (3) BCL2L14::ETV6 fusions in a more aggressive form of the triple-negative subtype that prime epithelial-mesenchymal transition and endow paclitaxel resistance, (4) the ETV6::NTRK3 fusion in secretory breast carcinoma that constitutively activates NTRK3 kinase, (5) the oncogenic MYB-NFIB fusion as a genetic driver underpinning adenoid cystic carcinomas of the breast that activates MYB Proto-Oncogene (MYB) pathway, and (6) the NOTCH/microtubule-associated serine-threonine (MAST) kinase gene fusions that activate NOTCH and MAST signaling. Importantly, these fusions are enriched in more aggressive and lethal breast cancer presentations and appear to confer therapeutic resistance. Thus, these gene fusions could be utilized as genetic biomarkers to identify patients who require more intensive treatment and surveillance. In addition, kinase fusions are currently being evaluated in breast cancer clinical trials and ongoing mechanistic investigation is exposing therapeutic vulnerabilities in patients with fusion-positive disease.",2022,"breast cancer; breast carcinoma; diagnostic significance; gene fusions; prognostic significance; therapeutic significance; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Adenoid Cystic; Estrogens; Female; Gene Fusion; Humans; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Prognosis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2",4

Nevertheless, treatments targeting E:C fusion has not been well established yet. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate potential therapies targeting E:C fusion based on systematic bioinformatical analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. One thousand related genes were extracted using transcriptome analysis, and major signaling pathways associated with breast cancer were identified with over-representation analysis. Then, we conducted drug-target network analysis based on the OncoKB and CIViC databases, and finally selected potentially applicable drug candidates. Six major cancer-related signaling pathways (p53, ATR/ATM, FOXM1, hedgehog, cell cycle, and Aurora B) were significantly altered in E:C fusion-positive cases of breast cancer. Further investigation revealed that nine genes (<i>AURKB</i>, <i>HDAC2</i>, <i>PLK1</i>, <i>CENPA</i>, <i>CHEK1</i>, <i>CHEK2</i>, <i>RB1</i>, <i>CCNA2</i>, and <i>MDM2</i>) in coordination with E:C fusion were found to be common denominators in three or more of these pathways, thereby making them promising gene biomarkers for target therapy.

In breast cancer, most of the detected gene fusions seem to be ""passenger"" events while the presence of recurrent and driver fusions is still under study. We performed RNA sequencing in 55 well-characterized breast cancer samples and 10 adjacent normal breast tissues, complemented by an analysis of SNP array data. We explored the presence of fusion genes and defined their association with breast cancer subtypes, clinical-pathologic characteristics and copy number aberrations. Overall, 370 fusions were detected across the majority of the samples. HER2+ samples had significantly more fusions than triple negative and luminal subtypes. The number of fusions was correlated with histological grade, Ki67 and tumor size. Clusters of fusion genes were observed across the genome and a significant correlation of fusions with copy number aberrations and more specifically amplifications was also revealed. Despite the large number of fusion events, only a few were recurrent, while recurrent individual genes forming fusions with different partners were also detected including the estrogen receptor 1 gene in the previously detected ESR1-CCDC170 fusion. Overall we detected novel gene fusion events while we confirmed previously reported fusions. Genomic hotspots of fusion genes, differences between subtypes and small number of recurrent fusions are the most relevant characteristics of these events in breast cancer.

With the progress in deep sequencing studies of breast cancer transcriptomes and genomes, the discovery of recurrent and pathological gene fusions in breast cancer is on the focus. Recently, driven by new deep sequencing studies, several recurrent or pathological gene fusions have been identified in breast cancer, including ESR1-CCDC170, SEC16A-NOTCH1, SEC22B-NOTCH2, and ESR1-YAP1&#xa0;etc. More important, most of these gene fusions are preferentially identified in the more aggressive breast cancers, such as luminal B, basal-like, or endocrine-resistant breast cancer, suggesting recurrent gene fusions as additional key driver events in these tumors other than the known drivers such as the estrogen receptor. In this paper, we have comprehensively summarized the newly identified recurrent or pathological gene fusion events in breast cancer, reviewed the contributions of new genomic and deep sequencing technologies to new fusion discovery and the integrative bioinformatics tools to analyze these data, highlighted the biological relevance and clinical implications of these fusion discoveries, and discussed future directions of gene fusion research in breast cancer.",2017,"Bioinformatics; Breast cancer; Genomics; Next-generation sequencing; Recurrent gene fusions; Tumorigenesis; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Fusion; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Sequence Analysis, DNA",4

The etiology of most cases of CaP is not understood completely, which makes it imperative to search for the molecular basis of CaP and markers for early diagnosis. Epigenetic modifications, including changes in DNA methylation patterns, histone modifications, miRNAs, and lncRNAs are key drivers of prostate tumorigenesis. These epigenetic defects might be due to deregulated expression of the epigenetic machinery, affecting the expression of several important genes like GSTP1, RASSF1, CDKN2, RARRES1, IGFBP3, RARB, TMPRSS2-ERG, ITGB4, AOX1, HHEX, WT1, HSPE, PLAU, FOXA1, ASC, GPX3, EZH2, LSD1, etc. In this review, we highlighted the most important epigenetic gene alterations and their variations as a diagnostic marker and target for therapeutic intervention of CaP in the future.

The incidence increases with age, and it is higher among African Americans. The occurrence of prostate cancer is associated with many risk factors, including genetic and hereditary predisposition. The most common genetic syndromes associated with prostate cancer risk are BRCA-associated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) and Lynch syndrome. Local-regional therapy, i.e., surgery is beneficial in early-stage prostate cancer management. Advanced and metastatic prostate cancers require systemic therapies, including hormonal inhibition, chemotherapy, and targeted agents. Most prostate cancers can be treated by targeting the androgen-receptor pathway and decreasing androgen production or binding to androgen receptors (AR). Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) usually involves the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and requires targeted therapy. Specific molecular therapy can target mutated cell lines in which DNA defect repair is altered, caused by mutations of&#xa0;BRCA2, partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) or the transmembrane protease serine 2-ERG (TMPRSS2-ERG)&#xa0;fusion.

Therapies targeting&#xa0;p53&#xa0;and AKT are the subject of ongoing clinical trials. Many genetic defects are listed as diagnostic, prognostic, and clinically actionable markers in prostate cancer. Androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) is an important oncogenic driver and an early diagnostic and prognostic marker, as well as a therapeutic target in hormone-resistant CRPC.

Epigenetic dysregulation is a feature of primary prostate cancer, and distinct DNA methylation profiles have been shown to be associated with the mutually exclusive SPOP-mutant or TMPRSS2-ERG fusion genetic backgrounds. Using a cohort of prostate cancer brain metastases (PCBM) from 42 patients, with matched primary tumors for 17 patients, we carried out a DNA methylation analysis to examine the epigenetic distinction between primary prostate cancer and PCBM, the association between epigenetic alterations and mutational background, and particular epigenetic alterations that may be associated with PCBM. Multiregion sampling of PCBM revealed epigenetic stability within metastases. Aberrant methylation in PCBM was associated with mutational background and PRC2 complex activity, an effect that is particularly pronounced in SPOP-mutant PCBM. While PCBM displayed a CpG island hypermethylator phenotype, hypomethylation at the promoters of genes involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and cell adhesion molecules such as GABRB3, CLDN8, and CLDN4 was also observed, suggesting that cells from primary tumors may require specific reprogramming to form brain metastasis. This study revealed the DNA methylation landscapes of PCBM and the potential mechanisms and effects of PCBM-associated aberrant DNA methylation. DNA methylation analysis reveals the molecular characteristics of PCBM and may serve as a starting point for efforts to identify and target susceptibilities of these rare metastases.",2023,Humans; Male; DNA Methylation; Prostatic Neoplasms; CpG Islands; Epigenomics; Brain Neoplasms; Nuclear Proteins; Repressor Proteins,78
36562110,ERG,10.1002/pros.24474,Conditional gene regulation models demonstrate a pro-proliferative role for growth hormone receptor in prostate cancer.,"Humans with inactivating mutations in growth hormone receptor (GHR) have lower rates of cancer, including prostate cancer. Similarly, mice with inactivating Ghr mutations are protected from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in the C3(1)/TAg prostate cancer model. However, gaps in clinical relevance in those models persist. The current study addresses these gaps and the ongoing role of Ghr in prostate cancer using loss-of-function and gain-of-function models. Conditional Ghr inactivation was achieved in the C3(1)/TAg model by employing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre and a prostate-specific Cre. In parallel, a transgenic GH antagonist was also used. Pathology, proliferation, and gene expression of 6-month old mouse prostates were assessed. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data was conducted to identify GHR overexpression in a subset of human prostate cancers. Ghr overexpression was modeled in PTEN-P2 and TRAMP-C2 mouse prostate cancer cells using stable transfectants. The growth, proliferation, and gene expression effects of Ghr overexpression was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Loss-of-function for Ghr globally or in prostatic epithelial cells reduced proliferation and stratification of the prostatic epithelium in the C3(1)/TAg model. Genes and gene sets involved in the immune system and tumorigenesis, for example, were dysregulated upon global Ghr disruption. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed higher GHR expression in human prostate cancers with ERG-fusion genes or ETV1-fusion genes. Modeling the GHR overexpression observed in these human prostate cancers by overexpressing Ghr in mouse prostate cancer cells with mutant Pten or T-antigen driver genes increased proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Ghr overexpression regulated the expression of multiple genes oppositely to Ghr loss-of-function models. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function Ghr models, including prostatic epithelial cell specific alterations in Ghr, altered proliferation, and gene expression. These data suggest that changes in GHR activity in human prostatic epithelial cells play a role in proliferation and gene regulation in prostate cancer, suggesting the potential for disrupting GH signaling, for example by the FDA approved GH antagonist pegvisomant, may be beneficial in treating prostate cancer.",2023,"GH; GHR; IGF-1; Pten; RNA-seq; T-antigen; Animals; Humans; Infant; Male; Mice; Gene Expression Regulation; Growth Hormone; Prostate; Prostatic Neoplasms; Receptors, Somatotropin",78

We identify aberrant enhancer-like activation of GGAA tandem repeats as a characteristic feature of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with genetic defects of the ETV6 transcriptional repressor, including ETV6-RUNX1+ and ETV6-null B-ALL. We show that GGAA repeat enhancers are direct activators of previously identified ETV6-RUNX1+/- like B-ALL ""signature"" genes, including the likely leukemogenic driver EPOR. When restored to ETV6-deficient B-ALL cells, ETV6 directly binds to GGAA repeat enhancers, represses their acetylation, downregulates adjacent genes, and inhibits B-ALL growth. In ETV6-deficient B-ALL cells, we find that the ETS transcription factor ERG directly binds to GGAA microsatellite enhancers and is required for sustained activation of repeat enhancer-activated genes. Together, our findings reveal an epigenetic gatekeeper function of the ETV6 tumor suppressor gene and establish microsatellite enhancers as a key mechanism underlying the unique gene-expression program of ETV6-RUNX1+/- like B-ALL. We find a unifying mechanism underlying a leukemia subtype-defining gene-expression signature that relies on repetitive elements with poor conservation between humans and rodents. The ability of ETV6 to antagonize promiscuous, nonphysiologic ERG activity may shed light on other roles of these key regulators in hematolymphoid development and human disease.

There is strong evidence suggesting that individual tumor foci can arise as genetically distinct, clonally independent lesions. However, recent studies have also demonstrated that adjacent Gleason pattern (GP) 3 and GP4 lesions can originate from the same clone but follow divergent genetic and morphologic evolution. The clonal relationship of adjacent GP3 and GP5 lesions has thus far not been investigated. Here we analyzed a cohort of 14 cases-11 biopsy and 3 radical prostatectomy specimens-with a Gleason score of 3&#xa0;+&#xa0;5&#xa0;=&#xa0;8 or 5&#xa0;+&#xa0;3&#xa0;=&#xa0;8 present in the same biopsy or in a single dominant tumor nodule at radical prostatectomy. Clonal and subclonal relationships between GP3 and GP5 lesions were assessed using genetically validated immunohistochemical assays for ERG, PTEN, and P53. 9/14 (64%) cases showed ERG reactivity in both GP3 and GP5 lesions. Only 1/14 (7%) cases showed a discordant pattern with ERG staining present only in GP3. PTEN expression was lost in 2/14 (14%) cases with perfect concordance between GP5 and GP3. P53 nuclear reactivity was present in 1/14 (7%) case in both GP5 and GP3. This study provides first evidence that the majority of adjacent GP3 and GP5 lesions share driver alterations and are clonally related. In addition, we observed a lower-than-expected rate of PTEN loss in GP5 in the context of Gleason score 3&#xa0;+&#xa0;5&#xa0;=&#xa0;8 or 5&#xa0;+&#xa0;3&#xa0;=&#xa0;8 tumors.",2022,Clonality; ERG; Gleason pattern 5; Gleason score 3+5; P53; PTEN; Prostate cancer; Male; Humans; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Neoplasm Grading; Prostatectomy; Prostate; Prostatic Neoplasms,78

Mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa are 2.5-fold greater than global averages. However, the region has largely been excluded from the benefits of whole genome interrogation studies. Additionally, while structural variation (SV) is highly prevalent, PCa genomic studies are still biased towards small variant interrogation. Using whole genome sequencing and best practice workflows, we performed a comprehensive analysis of SVs for 180 (predominantly Gleason score &#x2265; 8) prostate tumours derived from 115 African, 61 European and four ancestrally admixed patients. We investigated the landscape and relationship of somatic SVs in driving ethnic disparity (African versus European), with a focus on African men from southern Africa. Duplication events showed the greatest ethnic disparity, with a 1.6- (relative frequency) to 2.5-fold (count) increase in African-derived tumours. Furthermore, we found duplication events to be associated with CDK12 inactivation and MYC copy number gain, and deletion events associated with SPOP mutation. Overall, African-derived tumours were 2-fold more likely to present with a hyper-SV subtype. In addition to hyper-duplication and deletion subtypes, we describe a new hyper-translocation subtype. While we confirm a lower TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive rate in tumours from African cases (10% versus 33%), novel African-specific PCa ETS family member and TMPRSS2 fusion partners were identified, including LINC01525, FBXO7, GTF3C2, NTNG1 and YPEL5. Notably, we found 74 somatic SV hotspots impacting 18 new candidate driver genes, with CADM2, LSAMP, PTPRD, PDE4D and PACRG having therapeutic implications for African patients. In this first African-inclusive SV study for high-risk PCa, we demonstrate the power of SV interrogation for the identification of novel subtypes, oncogenic drivers and therapeutic targets. Identifying a novel spectrum of SVs in tumours derived from African patients provides a mechanism that may contribute, at least in part, to the observed ethnic disparity in advanced PCa presentation in men of African ancestry.",2022,Advanced disease; African ancestry; Chromosomal instability; Ethnic disparity; Prostate cancer; Whole genome sequencing; Black People; Carcinogenesis; Humans; Male; Mutation; Neoplasm Grading; Nuclear Proteins; Prostatic Neoplasms; Repressor Proteins,78

There is urgent need of novel strategies to target poor prognosis subgroups, like PAX5 translocated. We considered 289 childhood BCP-ALL cases consecutively enrolled in Italy in the AIEOP-BFM ALL2000/R2006 protocols and we performed extensive molecular profiling, integrating gene expression, copy number analyses and fusion genes discovery by target-capture NGS. We developed preclinical strategies to target PAX5 fusion genes. We identified 135 cases without recurrent genetic rearrangements. Among them, 59 patients (43&#xb7;7%) had a Ph-like signature; the remaining cases were identified as ERG-related (26%), High-Hyperdiploid-like (17%), ETV6::RUNX1-like (8&#xb7;9%), MEF2D-rearranged (2&#xb7;2%) or KMT2A-like (1&#xb7;5%). A poor prognosis was associated with the Ph-like signature, independently from other high-risk features. Interestingly, PAX5 was altered in 54&#xb7;4% of Ph-like compared to 16&#xb7;2% of non-Ph-like cases, with 7 patients carrying PAX5 fusions (PAX5t), involving either novel (ALDH18A1, IKZF1, CDH13) or known (FBRSL1, AUTS2, DACH2) partner genes. PAX5t cases have a specific driver activity signature, extending to multiple pathways including LCK hyperactivation. Among FDA-approved drugs and inhibitors, we selected Dasatinib, Bosutinib and Foretinib, in addition to Nintedanib, known to be LCK ligands. We demonstrated the efficacy of the LCK-inhibitor BIBF1120/Nintedanib, as single agent or in combination with conventional chemotherapy, both ex vivo and in patient-derived xenograft model, showing a synergistic effect with dexamethasone.

To compare differences in PC subtype frequency and genomic aggressiveness by self-identified race. Five molecular subtype classifiers were applied for 426 Black and 762 White PC patients in the Decipher Genomics Resource Information Database (GRID). Differences in subtype frequency and tumor genomic risk (Decipher score &gt;0.6) by race were evaluated using &#x3c7;<sup>2</sup> tests and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models.

We performed cytogenetic, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses on samples from 210 patients aged &#x2265;60 years from the UKALL14 and UKALL60+ clinical trials. BCR-ABL1-positive disease was present in 26% (55/210) of patients, followed by low hypodiploidy/near triploidy in 13% (28/210). Cytogenetically cryptic rearrangements in CRLF2, ZNF384 and MEF2D were detected in 5%, 1% and &lt;1% of patients, respectively. Copy number abnormalities were common and deletions in ALL driver genes were seen in 77% of cases. IKZF1 deletion was present in 51% (40/78) of samples tested and the IKZF1plus profile was identified in over a third (28/77) of cases of B-cell precursor ALL. The genetic good-risk abnormalities high hyperdiploidy (n=2), ETV6-RUNX1 (no cases) and ERG deletion (no cases) were exceptionally rare in this cohort. RAS pathway mutations were seen in 17% (4/23) of screened samples. KDM6A abnormalities, including biallelic deletions, were discovered in 5% (4/78) of SNP arrays and 9% (2/23) of NGS samples, and represent novel, potentially therapeutically actionable lesions using EZH2 inhibitors. Outcome remained poor with 5-year event-free and overall survival rates of 17% and 24%, respectively, across the cohort, indicating a need for novel therapeutic strategies.",2022,Aged; Child; Cohort Studies; Gene Rearrangement; Genomics; Humans; Middle Aged; Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Prognosis,78

We exploited the known activity of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) as a chaperone critical for the function of numerous oncogenic drivers, including the androgen receptor and its variants, to detect aggressive prostate cancer. We linked a near-infrared fluorescing molecule to an HSP90 binding drug and demonstrated that this probe (designated HS196) was highly sensitive and specific for detecting implanted prostate cancer cell lines with greater uptake by more aggressive subtypes. In a phase I human study, systemically administered HS196 could be detected in malignant nodules within prostatectomy specimens. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified uptake of HS196 by malignant prostate epithelium from the peripheral zone (<i>AMACR<sup>+</sup>ERG<sup>+</sup>EPCAM<sup>+</sup></i> cells), including <i>SYP<sup>+</sup></i> neuroendocrine cells that are associated with therapeutic resistance and metastatic progression.

Both SPOP downregulation and mutation can lead to SPOP target stabilization promoting dysregulation of key regulatory pathways. CHD1 gene is commonly deleted in PCa. CHD1 loss significantly co-occurs with SPOP mutations, resulting in a PCa subclass with increased AR transcriptional activity and with a specific epigenetic pattern. In this study, SPOP alterations at mutational and protein levels and CHD1 copy number alterations have been analyzed and correlated with ERG and PTEN protein expression and with the clinical pathological features of the patients. SPOP protein loss has been detected in 42.9% of the cases, and it has been strongly associated with PTEN protein loss (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). CHD1 gene loss has been detected in 24.5% and SPOP mutations in 5.9% of the cases. Loss of CHD1 has been strongly associated with SPOP mutations (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.003) and has shown a trend to be associated with ERG wt cancers (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.08). The loss of SPOP protein (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01) and the combination of PTEN and SPOP protein loss (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.002) were both statistically more common in grade group 5 cancers, with a prevalence of 60% and 37.5%, respectively. Furthermore, SPOP loss/PTEN loss and SPOP wt/PTEN loss phenotypes were strongly associated with extraprostatic perineural infiltration (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.007). Strong CHD1 loss was associated with a shorter time to PSA recurrence in the univariate (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04), and showed a trend to be associated with the PSA recurrence risk in the multivariate analysis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.058). The results of the present study suggest that the loss of SPOP protein expression, either alone or in combination with loss of PTEN and, on the other hand, a marked loss of the CHD1 gene are very promising prognostic biomarkers in PCa.",2022,"CHD1; PSA recurrence; PTEN; SPOP; prostate cancer; Biomarkers, Tumor; DNA Helicases; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Nuclear Proteins; PTEN Phosphohydrolase; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Repressor Proteins; Transcriptional Regulator ERG; Tumor Suppressor Proteins",78

While socioeconomic status has been implicated as a driver of this disparity, little is known about the genomic mechanisms and distinct biological pathways that are associated with PCa of native men of African origin. To understand biological factors that contribute to this disparity we utilized a total of 406 multi-institutional localized PCa samples, collected by Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate biospecimen network and Moffitt Cancer Center/University of Pennsylvania Health science system. We performed comparative genomics and immunohistochemistry to identify the biomarkers that are highly enriched in NAM from west Africa and compared them with African American Men (AAM) and EAM. Quantified messenger RNA expression and Median H scores based on immune reactivity of staining cells, were compared using Mann Whitney test. For gene expression analysis, p values were further adjusted for multiple comparisons using false discovery rates. Immunohistochemical analysis on selected biomarkers showed a consistent association between ETS related gene (ERG) status and race with 83% of NAM exhibiting tumors that lacked TMPRSS2-ERG translocation (ERG<sup>negative</sup> ) as compared to AAM (71%) and EAM (52%). A higher proportion of NAM (29%) were also found to be double negative (ERG<sup>negative</sup> and PTEN<sup>Loss</sup> ) as compared to AAM (6%) and EAM (7%). NAM tumors had significantly higher immunoreactivity (H-score) for PSMA, and EZH2, whereas they have lower H-score for PTEN, MYC, AR, RB and Racemase, (all p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.05). Comparative genomics revealed that NAM had significant transcriptomic variability in AR-activity score. In pathways enrichment analysis NAM tumors exhibited the enrichment of proinflammatory pathways including cytokine, interleukins, inflammatory response, and nuclear factor kappa B signaling. Prostate tumors in NAM are genomically distinct and are characterized by the dysregulation of several biomarkers.

Several transcription factors (TFs) have also been reported to regulate the antitumor activity and immune cell infiltration. This study aimed to quantify the populations of different immune cells infiltrated in tumor samples based on the bulk RNA sequencing data obtained from 50 cancer patients using the CIBERSORT and the EPIC algorithm. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) identified eigengene modules strongly associated with tumorigenesis and the activation of CD4+ memory T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. TF genes <i>FOXM1</i>, <i>MYBL2</i>, <i>TAL1</i>, and <i>ERG</i> are central in the subnetworks of the eigengene modules associated with immune-related genes. The analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer data confirmed these findings and further showed that the expression of these potential TF genes regulating immune infiltration, and the immune-related genes that they regulated, was associated with the survival of patients within multiple cancers. Exome-seq was performed on 24 paired samples that also had RNA-seq data. The expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis showed that mutations were significantly more frequent in the regions flanking the TF genes compared with those of non-TF genes, suggesting a driver role of these TF genes regulating immune infiltration. Taken together, this study presented a practical method for identifying genes that regulate immune infiltration.

The two most common genetic alterations in PCa are expression of the TMPRSS2/ERG (TE) fusion gene and loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor. These genetic alterations act cooperatively to transform prostatic epithelium but the exact mechanisms involved are unclear. Microarray expression analysis of immortalized prostate epithelial cells transformed by loss of PTEN and expression of the TE fusion revealed MEX3D as one of the most highly upregulated genes. MEX3D expression in prostate cancer was examined in patient samples and in silico. In vitro and in vivo studies to characterize the biological impact of MEX3D were carried out. Analysis of the TCGA PanCancer database revealed TCF3 as a major target of MEX3D. The induction of TCF3 by MEX3D was confirmed and the biological impact of TCF3 examined by in vitro studies. MEX3D is expressed at increased levels in prostate cancer and is increased by decreased PTEN and/or expression of the TE fusion gene and drives soft agar colony formation, invasion and tumor formation in vivo. The known oncogenic transcription factor TCF3 is highly correlated with MEX3D in prostate cancer. MEX3D expression strongly induces TCF3, which promotes soft agar colony formation and invasion in vitro.

Oncogenic TMPRSS2:ERG (ERG+) gene fusions are facilitated by DNA breaks and occur in up to 50% of prostate cancers. Infection-driven inflammation is implicated in the formation of ERG+ fusions, and we hypothesized that these fusions initiate in early inflammation-associated prostate cancer precursor lesions, such as proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA), prior to cancer development. We investigated whether bacterial prostatitis is associated with ERG+ precancerous lesions in unique cases with active bacterial infections at the time of radical prostatectomy. We identified a high frequency of ERG+ non-neoplastic-appearing glands in these cases, including ERG+ PIA transitioning to early invasive cancer. These lesions were positive for ERG protein by immunohistochemistry and <i>ERG</i> messenger RNA by in situ hybridization. We additionally verified TMPRSS2:ERG genomic rearrangements in precursor lesions using tricolor fluorescence in situ hybridization. Identification of rearrangement patterns combined with whole-prostate mapping in three dimensions confirmed multiple (up to eight) distinct ERG+ precancerous lesions in infected cases. We further identified the pathogen-derived genotoxin colibactin as a potential source of DNA breaks in clinical cases as well as cultured prostate cells. Overall, we provide evidence that bacterial infections can initiate driver gene alterations in prostate cancer. In addition, our observations indicate that infection-induced ERG+ fusions are an early alteration in the carcinogenic process and that PIA may serve as a direct precursor to prostate cancer.",2022,TMPRSS2:ERG fusion; colibactin; infection; inflammation; prostate cancer; Atrophy; Bacterial Infections; DNA Breaks; Humans; Male; Oncogene Fusion; Peptides; Polyketides; Prostate; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Prostatitis; Serine Endopeptidases; Transcriptional Regulator ERG,78

In contrast, we show here that mutually exclusive prostate cancer driver alterations involving the ERG transcription factor and the ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP are synthetic sick. At the molecular level, the incompatible cancer pathways are driven by opposing functions in SPOP. ERG upregulates wild type SPOP to dampen androgen receptor (AR) signaling and sustain ERG activity through degradation of the bromodomain histone reader ZMYND11. Conversely, SPOP-mutant tumors stabilize ZMYND11 to repress ERG-function and enable oncogenic androgen receptor signaling. This dichotomy regulates the response to therapeutic interventions in the AR pathway. While mutant SPOP renders tumor cells susceptible to androgen deprivation therapies, ERG promotes sensitivity to high-dose androgen therapy and pharmacological inhibition of wild type SPOP. More generally, these results define a distinct class of antagonistic cancer drivers and a blueprint toward their therapeutic exploitation.",2021,"Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Co-Repressor Proteins; DNA-Binding Proteins; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Immunoprecipitation; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Mutation; Nuclear Proteins; Oncogene Proteins; Prostatic Neoplasms; Protein Binding; Proteomics; Receptors, Androgen; Repressor Proteins; Signal Transduction; Transcriptional Regulator ERG; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase Complexes",78

No new EGFR mutations or loss of the EGFR T790M mutation are found in resistant clones. Resistant tumors grown under continuous osimertinib pressure both in humanized and non-humanized mice show aggressive tumor regrowth which is significantly less sensitive to osimertinib as compared with parental tumors. 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is identified as a potential driver of osimertinib acquired resistance, and its selective inhibition by BX795 and CRISPR gene knock out, sensitizes resistant clones. In-vivo inhibition of PDK1 enhances the osimertinib sensitivity against osimertinib resistant xenograft and a patient derived xenograft (PDX) tumors. PDK1 knock-out dysregulates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, promotes cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and active-YAP are upregulated in resistant tumors, and PDK1 knock-out inhibits nuclear translocation of YAP.

CUP can be life-threatening with a median overall survival of less than 1 year based on empirical chemotherapy. Gene detection technology advances the driver gene detection of malignant tumors and the appropriate precise therapy. Immunotherapy has ushered in a new era in cancer therapy, changing the way advanced tumors, including CUP, are treated. Combined with comprehensive clinical and pathological investigations, molecular analysis of the original tissue and detection of potential driver mutations may provide therapeutic recommendations for CUP. A 52-year-old female was admitted to hospital for dull abdominal pain, with peripancreatic lesions below the caudate lobe of the liver and posterior peritoneal lymph nodes enlargement. Conventional biopsy under endoscopic ultrasonography and laparoscopic biopsy both revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma based on immunohistochemical series. To help identify tumor origin and molecular characteristics, 90-gene expression assay, tumor gene expression profiling with Next-generation sequencing (NGS) method and Immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 were employed. Although no gastroesophageal lesions discovered by gastroenteroscopy, the 90-gene expression assay yielded a similarity score and prompted the most likely primary site was gastric/esophagus cancer. NGS revealed high TMB (19.3mutations/Mb) but no druggable driver genes identified. The Dako PD-L1 22C3 assay IHC assay for PD-L1 expression revealed a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 35%. Given the presence of negative predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy, including adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) c.646C&gt;T mutation at exon 7 and Janus kinase 1(JAK1), the patient received immunochemotherapy instead of immunotherapy alone. She was successfully treated with nivolumab plus carboplatin and albumin-bound nanoparticle paclitaxel for six cycles and nivolumab maintenance, which achieved a complete response (CR) maintained for 2 years without severe adverse events.

However, the key drivers of metabolic reprogramming underlying HCC progression remain unclear. Using a large-scale transcriptomic database and survival correlation screening, we identify thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) as a key driver. The progression of HCC is robustly mitigated by TK1 knockdown and significantly aggravated by its overexpression. Furthermore, TK1 promotes the oncogenic phenotypes of HCC not only through its enzymatic activity and production of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) but also by promoting glycolysis via binding with protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). Mechanistically, TK1 directly binds PRMT1 and stabilizes it by interrupting its interactions with tripartite-motif-containing 48 (TRIM48), which inhibits its ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Subsequently, we validate the therapeutic capacity of hepatic TK1 knockdown in a chemically induced HCC mouse model. Therefore, targeting both the enzyme-dependent and -independent activity of TK1 may be therapeutically promising for HCC treatment.",2023,"DNA methylation; PRMT1; hepatocellular carcinoma; metabolic reprogramming; ubiquitination; Animals; Mice; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Liver Neoplasms; Thymidine Kinase; Ubiquitination; Cell Line, Tumor",147

This subset of tumour behaves similarly to YWHAE-NUTM2A/B HG-ESS, however, they are both morphologically and immunophenotypically distinct neoplasms. The identified rearrangements in the BCOR gene have been accepted as both the driver and requisite feature in creating a novel sub-entity within the category of HG-ESS. Preliminary investigations into BCOR HG-ESS have shown similar outcomes to YWHAE-NUTM2A/B HG-ESS, with patients typically presenting with high stage disease. Clinical recurrences and metastases to lymph nodes, sacrum/bone, pelvis/peritoneum, lung, bowel and skin have been identified. In this report, we describe a case of BCOR HG-ESS, that is deeply myoinvasive and widely metastatic. Metastatic deposits include a mass in the breast discovered on self-examination; a metastatic site that has yet to be reported in the literature. A 59-year-old female underwent biopsy for post-menopausal bleeding, yielding a diagnosis of ""low-grade spindle cell neoplasm with myxoid stroma and endometrial glands"", favouring endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS). She was then referred for total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The resected uterine neoplasm was both intracavitary and deeply myoinvasive with morphology consistent with that of the biopsy specimen. Characteristic immunohistochemistry (IHC) was noted, and fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed BCOR rearrangement, supporting a diagnosis of BCOR HG-ESS. A few months postoperatively, the patient underwent needle core biopsy of the breast which revealed metastatic HG-ESS. This case highlights some of the diagnostic challenges posed by uterine mesenchymal neoplasms, and exemplifies the emerging histomorphologic, immunohistochemical, molecular and clinicopathologic features of the recently described HG-ESS with ZC3H7B-BCOR fusion.

This process of cancer cell dormancy remains poorly understood, largely due to difficulties in studying these dormant cells. In the face of these challenges, the application of knowledge from the cellular senescence and quiescence fields may help to guide future thinking on the study of dormant cancer cells. Both senescence and quiescence are common programs of proliferative arrest that are integral to tissue development and homeostasis. Despite phenotypic differences, these two states also share common characteristics, and both likely play a role in cancer dormancy and delayed metastatic relapse. Understanding the cell biology behind these states, their overlaps and unique characteristics is critical to our future understanding of dormant cancer cells, as these cells likely employ some of the same molecular programs to promote survival and dissemination.

In STEP 2, CRP reductions were greater with semaglutide 2.4&#xa0;mg (-49%) than with 1.0&#xa0;mg (-42%) but the difference did not reach statistical significance (ETD [95% CI]&#xa0;-12% [-23 to 1]; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.06). Reductions in CRP occurred in parallel with bodyweight loss and were consistent regardless of baseline BMI/bodyweight/glycaemic status. More semaglutide-treated participants had reductions in CRP-defined cardiovascular risk versus those on placebo. Reductions in CRP were positively correlated with reductions in bodyweight, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, and HOMA-IR (data not shown). In people with overweight/obesity, once-weekly semaglutide 2.4&#xa0;mg and 1.0&#xa0;mg reduced CRP concentration irrespective of baseline BMI/bodyweight/glycaemic status compared with placebo. These data suggest a potential anti-inflammatory role of semaglutide in obesity.

ARROW study has demonstrated a new selective RET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) shows remarkable and durable responses in RET-rearranged NCSLC. In this study mainly recruited patients with common fusion partners KIF5B and CCDC6. There is still a lack of definitive conclusions about effective of rare RET fusion variants to anti-RET therapies. A Chinese 58-year-old female renal insufficient patient with no history of smoking was diagnosed as stage IIIA (T2N2M0) lung adenocarcinoma. Next-generation sequencing targeting 520 cancer-related genes was performed on the pleural effusion samples and revealed 2 novel RET fusions LINCO1264-RET and SEMA5A-RET, concomitant with a common CCDC6-RET. The patient was first treated with multiple lines of chemotherapy and switched to lenvatinib but failed to respond. Due to renal insufficiency, she subsequently received pralsetinib with gradually reduced dosages (400 mg-300 mg-200 mg-100&#x2009;mg qd) and achieved a partial response (PR) lasting for more than 10 months, accompanied by the declined allele frequencies of all 3 RET fusions. We reported the first case of the pralsetinib efficacy in NSCLC with 3 concurrent RET fusions.

In <i>HER2</i>-amplified invasive breast cancer, a precursor lesion before DCIS has not yet been described. Here we introduce a case of HER2-positive lobules in the breast without histological abnormality. A 39-year-old premenopausal woman visited a hospital due to identification of microcalcifications on screening mammography. The subsequent biopsy confirmed high-grade DCIS. She underwent wide excision, and a residual high-grade DCIS with a size of 1.4&#x2005;cm was found. The tumor cells were hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Around DCIS, there were terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) showing strong HER2 positivity on IHC. These HER2-positive lobules were 7&#x2005;mm away from the high-grade DCIS and was 1.1&#x2005;mm in size. These HER2-positive lobules showed no histologic abnormality and had no difference compared with the surrounding normal TDLUs. Nevertheless, in addition to showing HER2 overexpression in IHC, <i>HER2</i> amplification was also identified in HER2 silver <i>in situ</i> hybridization. <i>HER2</i> amplification plays an important role in breast cancer development, and HER2 amplification is known to occur as an early event in cancer development. There have been studies identifying driver mutations in normal tissues of other organs. These findings suggest that <i>HER2</i> amplification in the breast without histological abnormality could occur, and the HER2-positive lobules could be ""at risk"" for transformation into the precursor lesion of HER2-positive breast cancer, although the biological significance of these findings is unclear.",2023,HER2 amplification; breast cancer; precursor lesion,147

The guideline reflects substantial advances in the understanding of the determinants, pathophysiology, assessment, and treatment of obesity. It shifts the focus of obesity management toward improving patient-centred health outcomes, functional outcomes, and social and economic participation, rather than weight loss alone. It gives recommendations for care that are underpinned by evidence-based principles of chronic disease management; validate patients' lived experiences; move beyond simplistic approaches of ""eat less, move more"" and address the root drivers of obesity. People living with obesity face substantial bias and stigma, which contribute to increased morbidity and mortality independent of body weight. Education is needed for all healthcare professionals in Ireland to address the gap in skills, increase knowledge of evidence-based practice, and eliminate bias and stigma in healthcare settings. We call for people living with obesity in Ireland to have access to evidence-informed care, including medical, medical nutrition therapy, physical activity and physical rehabilitation interventions, psychological interventions, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. This can be best achieved by resourcing and fully implementing the Model of Care for the Management of Adult Overweight and Obesity. To address health inequalities, we also call for the inclusion of obesity in the Structured Chronic Disease Management Programme and for pharmacotherapy reimbursement, to ensure equal access to treatment based on health-need rather than ability to pay.",2022,Clinical practice guideline; Ireland; Obesity; Adult; Humans; Ireland; Canada; Obesity; Overweight; Weight Loss; Chronic Disease,147

However, reports of concurrent LCH and AML are rare. Herein we report a novel case of concurrent LCH and AML which shared same the driver mutations, strongly suggesting a common clonal origin.An 84-year-old female presented with cervical lymphadenopathy and pruritic skin rash on the face and scalp. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia with 13% of blasts, elevated LDH and liver enzymes, in addition to generalised lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly by computed tomography. Bone marrow specimens showed massive infiltration of MPO-positive myeloblasts, whereas S-100 and CD1a positive atypical dendritic cell-like cells accounted for 10% of the atypical cells on bone marrow pathology, suggesting a mixture of LCH and AML. A biopsy specimen from a cervical lymph node and the skin demonstrated the accumulation of atypical cells which were positive for S-100 and CD1a. LCH was found in lymph nodes, skin and bone marrow; AML was found in peripheral blood and bone marrow (AML was predominant compared with LCH in the bone marrow). Next generation sequencing revealed four somatic driver mutations (<i>NRAS</i>-G13D, <i>IDH2</i>-R140Q, and <i>DNMT3A</i>-F640fs/-I715fs), equally shared by both the lymph node and bone marrow, suggesting a common clonal origin for the concurrent LCH and AML. Prednisolone and vinblastine were initially given with partial response in LCH; peripheral blood blasts also disappeared for 3 months. Salvage chemotherapy with low dose cytarabine and aclarubicin were given for relapse, with partial response in both LCH and AML. She died from pneumonia and septicemia on day 384. Our case demonstrates a common cell of origin for LCH and AML with a common genetic mutation, providing evidence to support the proposal to classify histiocytosis, including LCH, as a myeloid/myeloproliferative malignancy.",2022,BRAF V600E; MAPK pathway; NRAS; acute myeloid leukemia; dendritic cells; histiocytic disorders; inflammatory myeloid neoplasm; langerhans cell histiocytosis,147

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare cancer that is often associated with cortisol secretion, leading to paraneoplastic Cushing's syndrome. Mutations of the proto-oncogene RET are driver molecular events in 70% of MTC cases. Here, we report a case of a woman, born in 1956, who was diagnosed with sporadic MTC in 2005, with subsequent relapses treated with focal treatments. In April 2019, she presented with severe and rapidly progressive paraneoplastic Cushing's syndrome associated with lymph node, lung, liver and bone metastases. A supraclavicular lymph node biopsy revealed a somatic p.M918T (c.2753T&gt;C) mutation in exon 16 of the RET proto-oncogene. The patient began treatment with selpercatinib in September 2019. Clinical efficacy was immediate. Chronic diarrhea disappeared within a few days. Clinical hypercorticism quickly disappeared, with quick improvements in muscle and skin conditions and fatigue. Two months after treatment initiation, urinary free cortisol normalized to 42 &#xb5;g/24 h. Levels of the tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and calcitonin also greatly decreased from baseline. After 34 months of treatment, selpercatinib elicits sustained clinical, biological and morphological responses. In summary, this case report illustrates the rapid and long-lasting antisecretory effect of selpercatinib associated with tumor control. As Cushing's syndrome associated with medullary thyroid cancer is associated with poor prognosis, this case report is very encouraging. In addition, this suggests the potential benefit of molecular testing in all cases of medullary thyroid cancer.",2022,Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome; RET mutation; Selpercatinib; medullary thyroid cancer,147

Often used by PFs, the ""Key Driver Implementation Scale"" (KDIS) measures the degree to which a practice implements quality improvement activities from the Chronic Care Model, but the scale's psychometric properties have not been investigated. We examined construct validity, reliability, floor and ceiling effects, and a longitudinal trend test of the KDIS items in the Southeastern Collaboration to Improve Blood Pressure Control trial. The KDIS items assess a practice's progress toward implementing: a clinical information system (using their own data to drive change); standardized care processes; optimized team care; patient self-management support; and leadership support. We assessed construct validity and estimated reliability with a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). A trend test examined whether the KDIS items increased over time and estimated the expected number of months needed to move a practice to the highest response options. PFs completed monthly KDIS ratings over 12 months for 32 primary care practices, yielding a total of 384 observations. Data was fitted to a unidimensional CFA model; however, parameter fit was modest and could be improved. Reliability was 0.70. Practices started scoring at the highest levels beginning in month 5, indicating low variability. The KDIS items did show an upward trend over 12 months (all p &lt; .001), indicating that practices were increasingly implementing key activities. The expected time to move a practice to the highest response category was 9.1 months for standardized care processes, 10.2 for clinical information system, 12.6 for self-management support, 13.1 for leadership, and 14.3 months for optimized team care.

35978291,SHE,10.1186/s12864-022-08681-8,Low-cost and clinically applicable copy number profiling using repeat DNA.,"Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) are an important class of genomic alteration in cancer. They are frequently observed in cancer samples, with studies showing that, on average, SCNAs affect 34% of a cancer cell's genome. Furthermore, SCNAs have been shown to be major drivers of tumour development and have been associated with response to therapy and prognosis. Large-scale cancer genome studies suggest that tumours are driven by somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) or single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). Despite the frequency of SCNAs and their clinical relevance, the use of genomics assays in the clinic is biased towards targeted gene panels, which identify SNVs but provide limited scope to detect SCNAs throughout the genome. There is a need for a comparably low-cost and simple method for high-resolution SCNA profiling. We present conliga, a fully probabilistic method that infers SCNA profiles from a low-cost, simple, and clinically-relevant assay (FAST-SeqS). When applied to 11 high-purity oesophageal adenocarcinoma samples, we obtain good agreement (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, r<sub>s</sub>=0.94) between conliga's inferred SCNA profiles using FAST-SeqS data (approximately &#xa3;14 per sample) and those inferred by ASCAT using high-coverage WGS (gold-standard). We find that conliga outperforms CNVkit (r<sub>s</sub>=0.89), also applied to FAST-SeqS data, and is comparable to QDNAseq (r<sub>s</sub>=0.96) applied to low-coverage WGS, which is approximately four-fold more expensive, more laborious and less clinically-relevant. By performing an in silico dilution series experiment, we find that conliga is particularly suited to detecting SCNAs in low tumour purity samples. At two million reads per sample, conliga is able to detect SCNAs in all nine samples at 3% tumour purity and as low as 0.5% purity in one sample. Crucially, we show that conliga's hidden state information can be used to decide when a sample is abnormal or normal, whereas CNVkit and QDNAseq cannot provide this critical information. We show that conliga provides high-resolution SCNA profiles using a convenient, low-cost assay. We believe conliga makes FAST-SeqS a more clinically valuable assay as well as a useful research tool, enabling inexpensive and fast copy number profiling of pre-malignant and cancer samples.",2022,Barrett&#x2019;s oesophagus; Bayesian nonparametrics; Cancer; Copy number profiling; FAST-SeqS; MCMC; Oesophageal adenocarcinoma; Probabilistic model; Somatic copy number alterations; Sticky HDP-HMM; Tumour purity; Base Sequence; DNA; DNA Copy Number Variations; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Neoplasms,147

This article is the second of a two-part series. In Part 1, we summarised evidence-based recommendations for obtaining and processing small specimen samples (i.e. pre-analytical steps) from patients with advanced NSCLC. Here, in Part 2, we summarise evidence-based recommendations relating to analytical steps of biomarker testing (and associated reporting and quality assessment) of small specimen samples in NSCLC. As the number of biomarkers for actionable (genetic) targets and approved targeted therapies continues to increase, simultaneous testing of multiple actionable oncogenic drivers using next-generation sequencing (NGS) becomes imperative, as set forth in European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines. This is particularly relevant in advanced NSCLC, where tissue specimens are typically limited and NGS may help avoid tissue exhaustion compared with sequential biomarker testing. Despite guideline recommendations, significant discrepancies in access to NGS persist across Europe, primarily due to reimbursement constraints. The use of increasingly complex testing methods also has implications for the reporting of results. Molecular testing reports should include clinical interpretation with additional commentary on sample adequacy as appropriate. Molecular tumour boards are recommended to facilitate the interpretation of complex genetic information arising from NGS, and to collaboratively determine the optimal treatment for patients with NSCLC.

Data collection for this cross-sectional study was conducted in March 2022-National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month.&#xa0;Using the term colorectal cancer, 100 English-language Google News articles were extracted and coded for content. A combined approach-deductive and inductive coding-was utilized. Descriptive analyses were conducted, and frequency distributions were reported. Univariable analyses were performed to assess differences between articles that mentioned CRC screening and those that did not via chi-square tests.

Deep sequencing of mutations revealed subclones in the majority of metastatic tumors from 13 WGS cases. Validated mutations from 12 out of 13 WGS patients exhibited a predominant UV signature characterized by a high frequency of C-&gt;T transitions occurring at the 3' base of dipyrimidine sequences while one patient (MEL9) with a hypermutator phenotype lacked this signature. Strikingly, a subclonal mutation signature analysis revealed that the founding clone in MEL9 exhibited UV signature but the secondary clone did not, suggesting different mutational mechanisms for two clonal populations from the same tumor. Further analysis of four metastases from different geographic locations in 2 melanoma cases revealed phylogenetic relationships and highlighted the genetic alterations responsible for differential drug resistance among metastatic tumors.

Although lymphatic valves ensure unidirectional lymph flows, the flow itself controls lymphatic valve formation. Here, we demonstrate that a mechanically activated ion channel Piezo1 senses oscillating shear stress (OSS) and incorporates the signal into the genetic program controlling lymphatic valve development and maintenance. Time-controlled deletion of Piezo1 using a pan-endothelial Cre driver (Cdh5[PAC]-CreERT2) or lymphatic-specific Cre driver (Prox1-CreERT2) equally inhibited lymphatic valve formation in newborn mice. Furthermore, Piezo1 deletion in adult lymphatics caused substantial lymphatic valve degeneration. Piezo1 knockdown in cultured lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) largely abrogated the OSS-induced upregulation of the lymphatic valve signature genes. Conversely, ectopic Piezo1 overexpression upregulated the lymphatic valve genes in the absence of OSS. Remarkably, activation of Piezo1 using chemical agonist Yoda1 not only accelerated lymphatic valve formation in animals, but also triggered upregulation of some lymphatic valve genes in cultured LECs without exposure to OSS. In summary, our studies together demonstrate that Piezo1 is the force sensor in the mechanotransduction pathway controlling lymphatic valve development and maintenance, and Piezo1 activation is a potentially novel therapeutic strategy for congenital and surgery-associated lymphedema.",2020,"Lymph; Vascular Biology; endothelial cells; Animals; Antigens, CD; Cadherins; Endothelial Cells; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Ion Channels; Lymphangiogenesis; Lymphatic Vessels; Mechanotransduction, Cellular; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Models, Animal; Stress, Mechanical; Transcriptome; Up-Regulation",2

In contrast, the frequency of samples with PREX2 mutations was significantly higher in HCV-SVR samples than in HCV-positive samples (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.048). Among the patients with HCV-SVR, the frequency of samples with TP53 mutations was significantly higher in HCV-SVR-DAA tumors than in HCV-SVR-IFN tumors (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.030). TP53 inactivation scores in HCV-SVR-DAA tumors were found to be significantly enhanced in comparison to HCV-SVR-IFN tumors (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.022). In addition, chromosomal instability and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway signatures were enhanced in HCV-SVR-DAA tumors. HCV-SVR-DAA was significantly associated with portal vein invasion (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003) in comparison to HCV-SVR-IFN. Our dataset potentially serves as a fundamental resource for the genomic characteristics of HCV-SVR-DAA tumors. Our comprehensive genetic profiling by WES revealed significant differences in the mutation rate of several driver genes between HCV-positive tumors and HCV-SVR tumors. Furthermore, it was revealed that the frequency of samples with mutations in TP53 was significantly higher in HCV-SVR-DAA tumors than in HCV-SVR-IFN tumors.",2022,"direct-acting antiviral agent; hepatitis C virus; hepatocellular carcinoma; interferon; sustained virological response; Antiviral Agents; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Interferons; Liver Neoplasms; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53",10

Thus, our aim was to compare somatic mutations in potential driver genes in 109 TNBC and 81 HGSOC from young (Y &#x2264; 40 years) and elderly (E &#x2265; 75 years) patients. Open access mutational data (WGS or WES) were collected for TNBC and HGSOC patients. Potential driver genes were those that were present in the Cancer Gene Census-CGC, the Candidate Cancer Gene Database-CCGD, or OncoKB and those that were considered pathogenic in variant effect prediction tools. Mutational signature 3 (homologous repair defects) was the only gene that was represented in all four subgroups. The median number of mutated CGCs per sample was similar in HGSOC (Y:3 vs. E:4), but it was higher in elderly TNBC than it was in young TNBC (Y:3 vs. E:6). At least 90% of the samples from TNBC and HGSOC from Y and E patients presented at least one known affected TSG. Besides <i>TP53</i>, which was mutated in 67-83% of the samples, the affected TSG in <i>TP53</i> wild-type samples were <i>NF1</i> (yHGSOC and yTNBC), <i>PHF6</i> (eHGSOC and yTNBC), <i>PTEN</i>, <i>PIK3R1</i> and <i>ZHFX3</i> (yTNBC), <i>KMT2C</i>, <i>ARID1B</i>, <i>TBX3,</i> and <i>ATM</i> (eTNBC). A few samples only presented one affected oncogene (but no TSG): <i>KRAS</i> and <i>TSHR</i> in eHGSOC and <i>RAC1</i> and <i>PREX2</i> (a regulator of <i>RAC1</i>) in yTNBC. At least &#x2154; of the tumors presented mutated oncogenes associated with tumor suppressor genes; the Ras and/or PIK3CA signaling pathways were altered in 15% HGSOC and 20-35% TNBC (Y vs. E); DNA repair genes were mutated in 19-33% of the HGSOC tumors but were more frequently mutated in E-TNBC (56%). However, in HGSOC, 9.5% and 3.3% of the young and elderly patients, respectively, did not present any tumors with an affected CGC nor did 4.65% and none of the young and elderly TNBC patients.

T-cell immunotherapy can be a ""universal"" treatment for HLA genotype patients sharing same oncogenic mutations. To identify potential neoantigens for therapy in gastric cancer, 32 gastric cancer patients were enrolled in our study. Whole exome sequencing data from these patients was processed by TSNAD software to detect cancer somatic mutations and predict neoantigens. The somatic mutations between different patients suggested a high interpatient heterogeneity. C&gt;A and C&gt;T substitutions are common, suggesting an active nucleotide excision repair. The number of predicted neoantigens was significantly higher in patients at stage T1a compared to in patients at T2 or T4b. Six genes (<i>PIK3CA</i>, <i>FAT4</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>, <i>GNAQ</i>, <i>LRP1B</i>, and <i>PREX2</i>) were found as recurrently mutated driver genes in our study.

However, genetic progression mechanisms from GA to GC have not been clarified.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We performed whole-exome sequencing-based mutational analyses for 15 synchronous pairs of attached GAs and GCs.<b>Results:</b> There was no significant difference in the number of driver mutations or copy-number alterations between GAs and GCs. Well-known mutations of <i>TP53, APC, RNF43,</i> and <i>RPL22</i> were recurrently detected in synchronous GA/GC pairs. In addition, we discovered novel <i>KDM6A, PREX2, FAT1, KMT2C, GLI3,</i> and <i>RPL22</i> mutations and hypermutation in GAs, but did not identify recurrent drivers for GA-to-GC progression. Clonal structure analyses revealed that most GA/GC pairs exhibit parallel evolution with early divergence rather than stepwise evolution during GA-to-GC progression. Of note, three cases were identified as clonally nonrelated GA/GC pairs despite the lack of histologic differences. We found differences in dominant mutational signatures 1, 6, 15, and 17 in GA/GC trunks, GA branches, and GC branches. Compared with our previous work on synchronous colon adenoma/carcinoma genome structures, where most drivers were in the trunk with parallel evolution, synchronous GA/GC genomes showed a different model of parallel evolution, with many drivers in the branches.<b>Conclusions:</b> The preferred sequence of mutational events during GA-to-GC progression might be more context-dependent than colon adenoma progression. Our results show that nonclonal synchronous GA/GC is common and that GA genomes have already acquired distinct genomic alterations, suggesting caution in the diagnosis of synchronous GA and GC, especially in residual or recurrent cases. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(19); 4715-25. &#xa9;2018 AACR</i>.",2019,"Adenoma; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinogenesis; Carcinoma; Clonal Evolution; DNA Copy Number Variations; Disease Progression; Exome; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genomics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Neoplasm Proteins; Stomach Neoplasms; Exome Sequencing",10

Evaluation of PREX2 expression in these newly generated stable cells revealed varying levels of expression among the PREX2 isoforms, which was also observed in the stable cells made in the original study (Figure S6A; Berger et al., 2012). Additionally, ectopically expressed PREX2 was found to be at least 5 times above endogenous PREX2 expression.

BRAF, NRAS, and KIT are three well-known oncogenes involved in melanoma pathogenesis. Targeting of mutated BRAF kinase has recently been shown to significantly improve overall survival of metastatic melanoma patients, underscoring the particular role of this oncogene in melanoma biology. However, recurrences regularly occur within several months, which supposedly involve further oncogenes. Moreover, oncogenic driver mutations have not been described for up to 30% of all melanomas. In order to obtain a more complete picture of the mutational landscape of melanoma, more recent studies used high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies. A number of new oncogene candidates such as MAPK1/2, ERBB4, GRIN2A, GRM3, RAC1, and PREX2 were identified. Their particular role in melanoma biology is currently under investigation. Evidence for the functional relevance of some of these new oncogene candidates has been provided in in vitro and in vivo experiments. However, these findings await further validation in clinical studies. This review provides an overview on well-known melanoma oncogenes and new oncogene candidates, based on recent high-throughput sequencing studies. The list of genes discussed herein is of course not complete but highlights some of the most significant of recent findings in this area.

In early-stage disease, lesions are limited to the skin, but in later-stage disease, the tumor cells can escape into the blood, the lymph nodes, and at times the visceral organs. To clarify the genomic basis of CTCL, we performed genomic analysis of 220 CTCLs. Our analyses identify 55 putative driver genes, including 17 genes not previously implicated in CTCL. These novel mutations are predicted to affect chromatin (<i>BCOR</i>, <i>KDM6A</i>, <i>SMARCB1</i>, <i>TRRAP</i>), immune surveillance (<i>CD58</i>, <i>RFXAP</i>), MAPK signaling (<i>MAP2K1</i>, <i>NF1</i>), NF-&#x3ba;B signaling (<i>PRKCB</i>, <i>CSNK1A1</i>), PI-3-kinase signaling (<i>PIK3R1</i>, <i>VAV1</i>), RHOA/cytoskeleton remodeling (<i>ARHGEF3</i>), RNA splicing (<i>U2AF1</i>), T-cell receptor signaling (<i>PTPRN2</i>, <i>RLTPR</i>), and T-cell differentiation (<i>RARA</i>).

Last, we functionally validate <i>CSNK1A1</i> and <i>RLTPR</i> as putative oncogenes. <i>RLTPR</i> encodes a recently described scaffolding protein in the T-cell receptor signaling pathway.

Using a combined genomic approach, FGD5 amplification has been identified as a driver of proliferation in Luminal breast cancer. We aimed to describe FGD5 copy number change in breast cancer, and to assess a possible association with tumour proliferation and prognosis. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting FGD5 and chromosome 3 centromere (CEP3) on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from 430 primary breast cancers and 108 lymph node metastases, from a cohort of Norwegian breast cancer patients. We tested the association between FGD5 copy number status and proliferation (assessed by Ki67 levels and mitotic count) using Pearson's Chi square test, and assessed the prognostic impact of FGD5 copy number change by estimating cumulative risks of death and hazard ratios. We identified FGD5 amplification (defined as FGD5/CEP3 ratio &#x2265;2 or mean FGD5/tumour cell &#x2265;4) in 9.5% of tumours. Mitotic count and Ki67 levels were higher in tumours with FGD5 copy number increase, compared to tumours with no copy number change.

We used whole-exome sequencing, cancer gene panel deep-sequencing, and microarray gene expression profiling data derived from the Japanese version of the Cancer Genome Atlas (JCGA) in 93 PC cases. Somatic driver mutations were identified in 65.6% of samples in 19 genes. The median tumor mutation burden (TMB) value was 0.24 Muts/Mb (interquartile range, 0.15-0.64 Muts/Mb). The commonly mutated genes were <i>KRAS</i> (58%), <i>TP53</i> (40%), <i>CDKN2A</i> (10%), SMAD4 (10%), <i>FGFR2</i> (9%), and <i>PKHD1</i> (9%).

Herein, we focus on the response and resistance to current antiangiogenic drugs and immunotherapies and describe potential strategies for improved treatment outcomes. Antiangiogenic treatments that mainly target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling have shown efficacy in many types of cancer. However, drug resistance, characterized by disease recurrence, has limited therapeutic success and thus increased our urgency to better understand the mechanism of resistance to inhibitors of VEGF signaling. Moreover, cancer immunotherapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which stimulate antitumor immunity, have also demonstrated a remarkable clinical benefit in the treatment of many aggressive malignancies. Nevertheless, the emergence of resistance to immunotherapies associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment has restricted therapeutic response, necessitating the development of better therapeutic strategies to increase treatment efficacy in patients. Angiopoietin-2 (ANG2), which binds to the receptor tyrosine kinase TIE2 in endothelial cells, is a cooperative driver of angiogenesis and vascular destabilization along with VEGF. It has been suggested in multiple preclinical studies that ANG2-mediated vascular changes contribute to the development and persistence of resistance to anti-VEGF therapy. Further, emerging evidence suggests a fundamental link between vascular abnormalities and tumor immune evasion, supporting the rationale for combination strategies of immunotherapy with antiangiogenic drugs. In this review, we discuss the recent mechanistic and clinical advances in targeting angiopoietin signaling, focusing on ANG2 inhibition, to enhance therapeutic efficacy of antiangiogenic and ICI therapies. In short, we propose that a better mechanistic understanding of ANG2-mediated vascular changes will provide insight into the significance of ANG2 in treatment response and resistance to current antiangiogenic and ICI therapies. These advances will ultimately improve therapeutic modalities for cancer treatment.",2021,"ANG2; antiangiogenic therapy; cancer treatment; immunotherapy; resistance; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Angiopoietin-2; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Immunotherapy; Neoplasm Proteins; Neoplasms; Receptor, TIE-2",5

Here, we generated a patient-derived glioma sphere-forming cell (GSC) xenograft model resistant to the PI3K-specific inhibitor BKM-120. Integrated RNA sequencing and high-throughput drug screening revealed that the Aurora A kinase (Aurora A)/Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1)/cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) signaling pathway was the main driver of PI3K inhibitor resistance in the resistant xenografts. Aurora kinase was upregulated and pCDK1 was downregulated in resistant tumors from both xenografts and tumor tissues from patients treated with the PI3K inhibitor. Mechanistically, the tyrosine kinase receptor Tie2 physically interacted with FGFR1, promoting STAT3 phosphorylation and binding to the <i>AURKA</i> promoter, which increased Aurora A expression in resistant GSCs. Concurrent inhibition of Aurora A and PI3K signaling overcame PI3K inhibitor-induced resistance. This study offers a proof of concept to target PI3K and the collateral-activated pathway to improve GBM therapy.

27030594,TEK,10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf1164,Somatic PIK3CA mutations as a driver of sporadic venous malformations.,"Venous malformations (VM) are vascular malformations characterized by enlarged and distorted blood vessel channels. VM grow over time and cause substantial morbidity because of disfigurement, bleeding, and pain, representing a clinical challenge in the absence of effective treatments (Nguyenet al, 2014; Uebelhoeret al, 2012). Somatic mutations may act as drivers of these lesions, as suggested by the identification of TEK mutations in a proportion of VM (Limayeet al, 2009). We report that activating PIK3CA mutations gives rise to sporadic VM in mice, which closely resemble the histology of the human disease. Furthermore, we identified mutations in PIK3CA and related genes of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/AKT pathway in about 30% of human VM that lack TEK alterations. PIK3CA mutations promote downstream signaling and proliferation in endothelial cells and impair normal vasculogenesis in embryonic development. We successfully treated VM in mouse models using pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K&#x3b1; administered either systemically or topically. This study elucidates the etiology of a proportion of VM and proposes a therapeutic approach for this disease.",2016,"Animals; Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Embryo, Mammalian; Endothelial Cells; Integrases; Mice; Mutation; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Skin; Spinal Cord; Vascular Malformations",5

ARROW study has demonstrated a new selective RET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) shows remarkable and durable responses in RET-rearranged NCSLC. In this study mainly recruited patients with common fusion partners KIF5B and CCDC6. There is still a lack of definitive conclusions about effective of rare RET fusion variants to anti-RET therapies. A Chinese 58-year-old female renal insufficient patient with no history of smoking was diagnosed as stage IIIA (T2N2M0) lung adenocarcinoma. Next-generation sequencing targeting 520 cancer-related genes was performed on the pleural effusion samples and revealed 2 novel RET fusions LINCO1264-RET and SEMA5A-RET, concomitant with a common CCDC6-RET. The patient was first treated with multiple lines of chemotherapy and switched to lenvatinib but failed to respond. Due to renal insufficiency, she subsequently received pralsetinib with gradually reduced dosages (400 mg-300 mg-200 mg-100&#x2009;mg qd) and achieved a partial response (PR) lasting for more than 10 months, accompanied by the declined allele frequencies of all 3 RET fusions. We reported the first case of the pralsetinib efficacy in NSCLC with 3 concurrent RET fusions. Our case also indicates the sensitivity of the newly identified RET fusions to this RET selective inhibitor pralsetinib, and highlights the low-dose treatment option for patients with renal insufficient background.",2022,"Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Pyrazoles; Pyridines; Renal Insufficiency; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Lung Neoplasms; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Semaphorins",1

Here we show that choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), which synthesizes acetylcholine (ACh), is a critical driver of pathogenicity in EAE. Mice with ChAT-deficient Th17 cells resist disease progression and show reduced brain-infiltrating immune cells. ChAT expression in Th17 cells is linked to strong TCR signaling, expression of the transcription factor Bhlhe40, and increased Il2, Il17, Il22, and Il23r mRNA levels. ChAT expression in Th17 cells is independent of IL21r signaling but dampened by TGF&#x3b2;, implicating ChAT in controlling the dichotomous nature of Th17 cells. Our study establishes a cholinergic program in which ACh signaling primes chronic activation of Th17 cells, and thereby constitutes a pathogenic determinant of EAE.

High levels of immunosuppressive Tregs predict inferior response to chemotherapy, leukemia relapse, and shorter survival. However, mechanisms that promote Tregs in myeloid leukemias remain largely unexplored. Here, we identify leukemic extracellular vesicles (EVs) as drivers of effector proleukemic Tregs. Using mouse model of leukemia-like disease, we found that Rab27a-dependent secretion of leukemic EVs promoted leukemia engraftment, which was associated with higher abundance of activated, immunosuppressive Tregs. Leukemic EVs attenuated mTOR-S6 and activated STAT5 signaling, as well as evoked significant transcriptomic changes in Tregs. We further identified specific effector signature of Tregs promoted by leukemic EVs. Leukemic EVs-driven Tregs were characterized by elevated expression of effector/tumor Treg markers CD39, CCR8, CD30, TNFR2, CCR4, TIGIT, and IL21R and included 2 distinct effector Treg (eTreg) subsets: CD30+CCR8hiTNFR2hi eTreg1 and CD39+TIGIThi eTreg2. Finally, we showed that costimulatory ligand 4-1BBL/CD137L, shuttled by leukemic EVs, promoted suppressive activity and effector phenotype of Tregs by regulating expression of receptors such as CD30 and TNFR2. Collectively, our work highlights the role of leukemic extracellular vesicles in stimulation of immunosuppressive Tregs and leukemia growth. We postulate that targeting of Rab27a-dependent secretion of leukemic EVs may be a viable therapeutic approach in myeloid neoplasms.",2022,"4-1BB Ligand; Animals; Extracellular Vesicles; Immunosuppressive Agents; Ki-1 Antigen; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Mice; Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory",6

The RBP LARP1 is an mRNA stability regulator, and elevated expression of the protein in hepatocellular and lung cancers is correlated with adverse prognosis. LARP1 associates with an mRNA interactome that is enriched for oncogenic transcripts. Here we explore the role of LARP1 in epithelial ovarian cancer, a disease characterized by the rapid acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy through the induction of pro-survival signalling. We show, using ovarian cell lines and xenografts, that LARP1 is required for cancer cell survival and chemotherapy resistance. LARP1 promotes tumour formation in vivo and maintains cancer stem cell-like populations. Using transcriptomic analysis following LARP1 knockdown, cross-referenced against the LARP1 interactome, we identify BCL2 and BIK as LARP1 mRNA targets. We demonstrate that, through an interaction with the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of BCL2 and BIK, LARP1 stabilizes BCL2 but destabilizes BIK with the net effect of resisting apoptosis. Together, our data indicate that by differentially regulating the stability of a selection of mRNAs, LARP1 promotes ovarian cancer progression and chemotherapy resistance.",2016,"Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Autoantigens; Blotting, Western; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Disease Progression; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HeLa Cells; Humans; Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, Knockout; Mice, SCID; Microscopy, Confocal; Ovarian Neoplasms; Protein Binding; RNA Interference; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Ribonucleoproteins; Survival Analysis; Transplantation, Heterologous",6

CRISPR/Cas9 has recently emerged as a powerful and versatile genome editing tool for genome engineering in various species. We have used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to correct the ASXL1 homozygous nonsense mutation present in the CML cell line KBM5, which lacks ASXL1 protein expression. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ASXL1 homozygous correction resulted in protein re-expression with restored normal function, including down-regulation of Polycomb repressive complex 2 target genes. Significantly reduced cell growth and increased myeloid differentiation were observed in ASXL1 mutation-corrected cells, providing new insights into the role of ASXL1 in human myeloid cell differentiation. Mice xenografted with mutation-corrected KBM5 cells showed significantly longer survival than uncorrected xenografts. These results show that the sole correction of a driver mutation in leukemia cells increases survival in vivo in mice.

Recent high-throughput analyses of genomic alterations revealed several driver genes and altered pathways in GC. However, therapeutic applications from genomic data are limited, largely as a result of the lack of druggable molecular targets and preclinical models for drug selection. To identify new therapeutic targets for GC, we performed array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of DNA from 103 patients with GC for copy number alteration (CNA) analysis, and whole-exome sequencing from 55 GCs from the same patients for mutation profiling. Pathway analysis showed recurrent alterations in the Wnt signaling [APC, CTNNB1, and DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1)], ErbB signaling (ERBB2, PIK3CA, and KRAS), and p53 signaling/apoptosis [TP53 and BCL2L1 (BCL2-like 1)] pathways. In 18.4% of GC cases (19/103), amplification of the antiapoptotic gene BCL2L1 was observed, and subsequently a BCL2L1 inhibitor was shown to markedly decrease cell viability in BCL2L1-amplified cell lines and in similarly altered patient-derived GC xenografts, especially when combined with other chemotherapeutic agents. In 10.9% of cases (6/55), mutations in DLC1 were found and were also shown to confer a growth advantage for these cells via activation of Rho-ROCK signaling, rendering these cells more susceptible to a ROCK inhibitor. Taken together, our study implicates BCL2L1 and DLC1 as potential druggable targets for specific subsets of GC cases.",2016,"copy number alteration; druggable target; gastric cancer; patient-derived xenograft; whole-exome sequencing; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Comparative Genomic Hybridization; DNA Copy Number Variations; Exome; Female; GTPase-Activating Proteins; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit; Male; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, Knockout; Mice, SCID; Middle Aged; Mutation; RNA Interference; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Stomach Neoplasms; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; bcl-X Protein",6

By multiplexing fluorescence in situ hybridization probes for these mutations, up to eight genetic abnormalities can be detected in single cells, a genetic signature of subclones identified and a composite picture of subclonal architecture and putative ancestral trees assembled. Subclones in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia have variegated genetics and complex, nonlinear or branching evolutionary histories. Copy number alterations are independently and reiteratively acquired in subclones of individual patients, and in no preferential order. Clonal architecture is dynamic and is subject to change in the lead-up to a diagnosis and in relapse.

A recent computational study involving the TCGA database of glioma patients found RUNX1T1 as one of the downregulated driver genes associated with poor overall survival of glioma patients. Hypoxia-inducible factor&#xa0;1&#x3b1; (HIF1&#x3b1;) is upregulated in glioma and has been associated with the severity and drug resistance of glioma. Previously, we have shown that RUNX1T3 degrades HIF1&#x3b1; affecting the proliferation of leukemia cells. We hypothesize that RUNX1T1 might be associated with the growth and development of glioma through the regulation of HIF1&#x3b1;. We have evaluated the expression level of RUNX1T1 at different stages of glioma and the effect of RUNX1T1 on the proliferation and invasiveness of glioblastoma cells in vitro. We further looked at the effect of RUNX1T1 on the expression and stability of HIF1&#x3b1; in vitro. Expression of RUNX1T1 was significantly downregulated, both at RNA and protein levels in glioma samples as studied by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. While expression of HIF1&#x3b1; was higher in glioma tissues compared with its level in the normal brain. In vitro studies demonstrated that RUNX1T1 interacted with HIF1&#x3b1; and recruited HIF1&#x3b1; modification factor such as PHD2 and GSK3&#x3b2; causing hydroxylation of HIF1&#x3b1; following ubiquitination by FBW7.

Mutations occur in genes encoding members of the cellular machinery controlling transcription and chromatin structure, including transcription factors, chromatin modifiers, DNA-methyltransferases, but also signaling molecules that activate inducible transcription factors controlling gene expression and cell growth. Mutant cells in AML patients are unable to differentiate and adopt new identities that are shaped by the original driver mutation and by rewiring their gene regulatory networks into regulatory phenotypes with enhanced fitness. One of the best-studied AML-subtypes is the t(8;21) AML which carries a translocation fusing the DNA-binding domain of the hematopoietic master regulator RUNX1 to the ETO gene. The resulting oncoprotein, RUNX1/ETO has been studied for decades, both at the biochemical but also at the systems biology level. It functions as a dominant-negative version of RUNX1 and interferes with multiple cellular processes associated with myeloid differentiation, growth regulation and genome stability.

The first type of mutations tends to be in genes encoding members of the epigenetic/transcription regulatory machinery (i.e., RUNX1, DNMT3A, TET2), while the secondary mutations often involve genes encoding members of signaling pathways that cause uncontrolled growth of such cells such as the growth factor receptors c-KIT of FLT3. Patients usually present with both types of mutations, but it is currently unclear how both mutational events shape the epigenome in developing AML cells. To this end we generated an in vitro model of t(8;21) AML by expressing its driver oncoprotein RUNX1-ETO with or without a mutated (N822K) KIT protein. Expression of N822K-c-KIT strongly increases the self-renewal capacity of RUNX1-ETO-expressing cells. Global analysis of gene expression changes and alterations in the epigenome revealed that N822K-c-KIT expression profoundly influences the open chromatin landscape and transcription factor binding.

However, the association between genetic mechanisms and early HCC recurrence, especially in Chinese patients, remains largely unknown. We performed whole-genome sequencing (49 cases), whole-exome sequencing (18 cases), and deep targeted sequencing (115 cases) on 182 primary HCC samples. Focusing on WNK2, we used Sanger sequencing and qPCR to evaluate all the coding exons and copy numbers of that gene in an additional 554 HCC samples. We also explored the functional effect and mechanism of WNK2 on tumor growth and metastasis. We identified 5 genes (WNK2, RUNX1T1, CTNNB1, TSC1, and TP53) harboring somatic mutations that correlated with early tumor recurrence after curative resection in 182 primary HCC samples. Focusing on WNK2, the overall somatic mutation and copy number loss occurred in 5.3% (39/736) and 27.2% (200/736), respectively, of the total 736 HCC samples. Both types of variation were associated with lower WNK2 protein levels, higher rates of early tumor recurrence, and shorter overall survival. Biofunctional investigations revealed a tumor-suppressor role of WNK2: its inactivation led to ERK1/2 signaling activation in HCC cells, tumor-associated macrophage infiltration, and tumor growth and metastasis. Our results delineate genomic events that characterize Chinese HCCs and identify WNK2 as a driver of early HCC recurrence after curative resection.

Taken together, our results reveal that RUNX1T1 serves as a common angiogenic driver for vaculogenesis and functionality of endothelial lineage cells.

Defects in late lung development manifest in premature infants as a chronic lung disease named bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Numerous studies demonstrated the therapeutic properties of exogenous bone marrow and umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in experimental BPD. However, very little is known regarding the regenerative capacity of resident lung MSCs (L-MSCs) during normal development and in BPD. In this study we aimed to characterize the L-MSC population in homeostasis and upon injury. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile in situ Ly6a+ L-MSCs in the lungs of normal and O2-exposed neonatal mice (a well-established model to mimic BPD) at 3 developmental timepoints (postnatal days 3, 7, and 14). Hyperoxia exposure increased the number and altered the expression profile of L-MSCs, particularly by increasing the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic, and anti-angiogenic genes. In order to identify potential changes induced in the L-MSCs transcriptome by storage and culture, we profiled 15 000 Ly6a+ L-MSCs after in vitro culture. We observed great differences in expression profiles of in situ and cultured L-MSCs, particularly those derived from healthy lungs. Additionally, we have identified the location of Ly6a+/Col14a1+ L-MSCs in the developing lung and propose Serpinf1 as a novel, culture-stable marker of L-MSCs. Finally, cell communication analysis suggests inflammatory signals from immune and endothelial cells as main drivers of hyperoxia-induced changes in L-MSCs transcriptome.",2022,"bronchopulmonary dysplasia; lung MSC; lung development; scRNA-seq; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Hyperoxia; Infant, Newborn; Lung; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Sequence Analysis, RNA",3

Next-generation sequencing studies have identified novel genetic drivers of gastric cancer, but their use as molecular classifiers or prognostic markers of disease outcome has yet to be established. In this study, we integrated somatic mutational profiles and clinicopathologic information from 544 gastric cancer patients from previous genomic studies to identify significantly mutated genes (SMG) with prognostic relevance. Gastric cancer patients were classified into regular (86.8%) and hypermutated (13.2%) subtypes based on mutation burden. Notably, TpCpW mutations occurred significantly more frequently in regular, but not hypermutated, gastric cancers, where they were associated with APOBEC expression. In the former group, six previously unreported (XIRP2, NBEA, COL14A1, CNBD1, ITGAV, and AKAP6) and 12 recurrent mutated genes exhibited high mutation prevalence (&#x2265;3.0%) and an unexpectedly higher incidence of nonsynonymous mutations. We also identified two molecular subtypes of regular-mutated gastric cancer that were associated with distinct prognostic outcomes, independently of disease staging, as confirmed in a distinct patient cohort by targeted capture sequencing. Finally, in diffuse-type gastric cancer, CDH1 mutation was found to be associated with shortened patient survival, independently of disease staging. Overall, our work identified previously unreported SMGs and a mutation signature predictive of patient survival in newly classified subtypes of gastric cancer, offering opportunities to stratify patients into optimal treatment plans based on molecular subtyping.

In a representative breast cancer cell line, ZR-75-30, we searched for fusion genes, by analysing genome rearrangements. We first analysed rearrangements of the ZR-75-30 genome, to around 10kb resolution, by molecular cytogenetic approaches, combining array painting and array CGH. We then compared this map with genomic junctions determined by paired-end sequencing. Most of the breakpoints found by array painting and array CGH were identified in the paired end sequencing-55% of the unamplified breakpoints and 97% of the amplified breakpoints (as these are represented by more sequence reads). From this analysis we identified 9 expressed fusion genes: APPBP2-PHF20L1, BCAS3-HOXB9, COL14A1-SKAP1, TAOK1-PCGF2, TIAM1-NRIP1, TIMM23-ARHGAP32, TRPS1-LASP1, USP32-CCDC49 and ZMYM4-OPRD1. We also determined the genomic junctions of a further three expressed fusion genes that had been described by others, BCAS3-ERBB2, DDX5-DEPDC6/DEPTOR and PLEC1-ENPP2. Of this total of 12 expressed fusion genes, 9 were in the coamplification. Due to the sensitivity of the technologies used, we estimate these 12 fusion genes to be around two-thirds of the true total. Many of the fusions seem likely to be driver mutations. For example, PHF20L1, BCAS3, TAOK1, PCGF2, and TRPS1 are fused in other breast cancers. HOXB9 and PHF20L1 are members of gene families that are fused in other neoplasms. Several of the other genes are relevant to cancer-in addition to ERBB2, SKAP1 is an adaptor for Src, DEPTOR regulates the mTOR pathway and NRIP1 is an estrogen-receptor coregulator. This is the first structural analysis of a breast cancer genome that combines classical molecular cytogenetic approaches with sequencing. Paired-end sequencing was able to detect almost all breakpoints, where there was adequate read depth. It supports the view that gene breakage and gene fusion are important classes of mutation in breast cancer, with a typical breast cancer expressing many fusion genes.",2013,"Base Sequence; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Chromosome Mapping; Cloning, Molecular; Comparative Genomic Hybridization; Female; Genome, Human; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA",3

We aimed to determine the drivers predisposing to unfavorable PC outcomes anticipated by BCR events among patients of similar preoperative characteristics. The TCGA transcriptomic and clinical data of 497 PC individuals were used, stratified according to the risk of BCR by EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-SIOG. The relevance of the functional markers regarding BCR-free survival was examined by the cutp algorithm. Through UpSetR, subgroups of PC patients bearing an unfavorable signature were identified, followed by the hierarchical clustering of the major markers of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). BCR-free survival was estimated with the Cox proportional hazards regression model. <i>ESR1</i> significantly differentiated BCR-free survival, whereas <i>AR</i> did not. An elevation in <i>KLK3</i> correlated with better prognosis, although <i>PGR</i>, <i>KLK3</i>, <i>CDH1</i>, and <i>MMP3</i> predicted BCR better than the preoperative PSA level. Patients sharing an unfavorable profile of <i>ESR1</i> and <i>MMP3</i> together with lymph node status, Gleason score, T, and EAU risk groups were at a higher risk of BCR originating from mesenchymal features of PC cells. To conclude, we revealed an <i>ESR1</i>-driven unfavorable profile of EMT underpinning a worse PC trajectory. <i>ESR1</i> may have a major role in PC progression; therefore, it could become a major focus for further investigations.",2023,"androgen receptor; biochemical recurrence; disease progression; epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; estrogen receptor; high-risk; prostate cancer; prostate-specific antigen; Humans; Male; Matrix Metalloproteinase 3; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Transcriptome",16

This has led to the hypothesis that select sets of transcription factors act on similar target genes as an integrated network, buffering a tumor's transcriptional state. Noninvasive papillary urothelial carcinoma (NIPUC) with higher cell cycle activity has higher risk of recurrence and progression. In this paper, we describe a transcriptional network of cell cycle dysregulation in NIPUC, which was delineated using the ARACNe algorithm applied to expression data from a new cohort (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;81, RNA sequencing), and two previously published cohorts. The transcriptional network comprised 121 transcription factors, including the pluripotency factors SOX2 and SALL4, the sex hormone binding receptors ESR1 and PGR, and multiple homeobox factors. Of these 121 transcription factors, 65 and 56 were more active in tumors with greater and less cell cycle activity, respectively. When clustered by activity of these transcription factors, tumors divided into High Cell Cycle versus Low Cell Cycle groups. Tumors in the High Cell Cycle group demonstrated greater mutational burden and copy number instability. A putative mutational driver of cell cycle dysregulation, such as homozygous loss of CDKN2A, was found in only 50% of High Cell Cycle NIPUC, suggesting a prominent role of transcription factor activity in driving cell cycle dysregulation. Activity of the 121 transcription factors strongly associated with expression of EZH2 and other members of the PRC2 complex, suggesting regulation by this complex influences expression of the transcription factors in this network. Activity of transcription factors in this network also associated with signatures of pluripotency and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), suggesting they play a role in driving evolution to invasive carcinoma. Consistent with this, these transcription factors differed in activity between NIPUC and invasive urothelial carcinoma.",2022,"Carcinoma in Situ; Carcinoma, Papillary; Carcinoma, Transitional Cell; Cell Cycle; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Transcription Factors; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms",16

AR splice variant-7 (AR-V7) is a truncated variant of AR that leads to AR inhibitor therapy resistance in prostate cancer; recent studies have identified AR-V7 in BC and theorized that AR-V7 can have a similar impact. This study assessed the prevalence and clinicopathologic features associated with AR-V7 in a large BC cohort. BC samples were evaluated by MSK-Fusion targeted RNAseq for AR-V7 detection and MSK-IMPACT targeted DNAseq, including triple-negative tumors with no driver alteration and estrogen receptor-positive/ESR1 wildtype tumors progressing on therapy. Among 196 primary and metastatic/recurrent cases (196 RNAseq, 194DNAseq), 9.7% (19/196) were AR-V7 positive and 90.3% (177/196) AR-V7 negative. All AR-V7 positive BC were AR-positive by immunohistochemistry (19/19). The prevalence of AR-V7 by receptor subtype (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;189) was: 18% (12/67) in ER-/PgR-/HER2-negative BC, 3.7% (4/109) in ER-positive/HER2-negative BC, and 15.4% (2/13) in HER2-positive BC; AR-V7 was detected in one ER-positive/HER2-unknown BC. Apocrine morphology was observed in 42.1% (8/19) of AR-V7 positive BC and 3.4% (6/177) AR-V7 negative BC (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.00001). Notably, AR-V7 was detected in 2 primary BC and 7 metastatic/recurrent BC patients with no prior endocrine therapy. We conclude that positive AR IHC and apocrine morphology are pathologic features that may indicate testing for AR-V7 is warranted in both primary and metastatic BC in the appropriate clinical context. The study findings further encourage the assessment of AR-V7 as a predictive biomarker for AR antagonist benefit in ongoing clinical BC trials.",2022,"Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Protein Isoforms; Receptors, Androgen",16
33008833,PGR,10.1101/mcs.a005629,Case report: 16-yr life history and genomic evolution of an ER<sup>+</sup> HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer.,"Metastatic breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in women. Limited studies have been done on the genomic evolution between primary and metastatic breast cancer. We reconstructed the genomic evolution through the 16-yr history of an ER<sup>+</sup> HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer patient to investigate molecular mechanisms of disease relapse and treatment resistance after long-term exposure to hormonal therapy. Genomic and transcriptome profiling was performed on primary breast tumor (2002), initial recurrence (2012), and liver metastasis (2015) samples. Cell-free DNA analysis was performed at 11 time points (2015-2017). Mutational analysis revealed a low mutational burden in the primary tumor that doubled at the time of progression, with driver mutations in PI3K-Akt and RAS-RAF signaling pathways. Phylogenetic analysis showed an early branching off between primary tumor and metastasis. Liquid biopsies, although initially negative, started to detect an <i>ESR1 E380Q</i> mutation in 2016 with increasing allele frequency until the end of 2017. Transcriptome analysis revealed 721 (193 up, 528 down) genes to be differentially expressed between primary tumor and first relapse. The most significantly down-regulated genes were <i>TFF1</i> and <i>PGR</i>, indicating resistance to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy. The most up-regulated genes included <i>PTHLH</i>, <i>S100P</i>, and <i>SOX2</i>, promoting tumor growth and metastasis.

30325183,PGR,10.1530/REP-18-0282,Retinoid signaling controlled by SRC-2 in decidualization revealed by transcriptomics.,"Establishment of a successful pregnancy requires not only implantation of a healthy embryo into a receptive uterus but also progesterone receptor (PGR)-dependent transformation of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) into specialized decidual cells. Decidual cells support the developing embryo and are critical for placentation. We have previously shown that a known transcriptional coregulator of the PGR, steroid receptor coactivator-2 (SRC-2), is a critical driver of endometrial decidualization in both human and mouse endometrium. However, the full spectrum of genes transcriptionally controlled by SRC-2 in decidualizing ESCs has not been identified. Therefore, using an RNA- and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing approach, we have identified the transcriptome of decidualizing human ESCs (hESCs) that requires SRC-2. We revealed that the majority of hESC genes regulated by SRC-2 are associated with decidualization. Over 50% of SRC-2-regulated genes are also controlled by the PGR. While ontology analysis showed that SRC-2-dependent genes are functionally linked to signaling processes known to underpin hESC decidualization, cell membrane processes were significantly enriched in this analysis. Follow-up studies showed that retinoid signaling is dependent on SRC-2 during hESC decidualization. Specifically, SRC-2 is required for full induction of the retinol transporter, stimulated by retinoic acid 6 (STRA6), which is essential for hESC decidualization. Together our findings show that a critical subset of genes transcriptionally reprogramed by PGR during hESC decidualization requires SRC-2. Among the multiple genes, pathways and networks that are dependent on SRC-2 during hESC decidualization, first-line analysis supports a critical role for this coregulator in maintaining retinoid signaling during progesterone-driven decidualization.",2019,"Cells, Cultured; Endometrium; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2; Receptors, Progesterone; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome",16
30142194,PGR,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007630,The uterine epithelial loss of Pten is inefficient to induce endometrial cancer with intact stromal Pten.,"Mutation of the tumor suppressor Pten often leads to tumorigenesis in various organs including the uterus. We previously showed that Pten deletion in the mouse uterus using a Pgr-Cre driver (Ptenf/fPgrCre/+) results in rapid development of endometrial carcinoma (EMC) with full penetration. We also reported that Pten deletion in the stroma and myometrium using Amhr2-Cre failed to initiate EMC. Since the Ptenf/fPgrCre/+ uterine epithelium was primarily affected by tumorigenesis despite its loss in both the epithelium and stroma, we wanted to know if Pten deletion in epithelia alone will induce tumorigenesis. We found that mice with uterine epithelial loss of Pten under a Ltf-iCre driver (Ptenf/f/LtfCre/+) develop uterine complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH), but rarely EMC even at 6 months of age. We observed that Ptenf/fPgrCre/+ uteri exhibit a unique population of cytokeratin 5 (CK5) and transformation related protein 63 (p63)-positive epithelial cells; these cells mark stratified epithelia and squamous differentiation. In contrast, Ptenf/fLtfCre/+ hyperplastic epithelia do not undergo stratification, but extensive epithelial cell apoptosis. This increased apoptosis is associated with elevation of TGF&#x3b2; levels and activation of downstream effectors, SMAD2/3 in the uterine stroma. Our results suggest that stromal PTEN via TGF&#x3b2; signaling restrains epithelial cell transformation from hyperplasia to carcinoma.

29546395,PGR,10.1093/biolre/ioy060,Uterine function in the mouse requires speckle-type poz protein.,"Speckle-type poz protein (SPOP) is an E3-ubiquitin ligase adaptor for turnover of a diverse number of proteins involved in key cellular processes such as chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and cell signaling. Genomic analysis revealed that SPOP somatic mutations are found in a subset of endometrial cancers, suggesting that these mutations act as oncogenic drivers of this gynecologic malignancy. These studies also raise the question as to the role of wild-type SPOP in normal uterine function. To address this question, we generated a mouse model (Spopd/d) in which SPOP is ablated in uterine cells that express the PGR. Fertility studies demonstrated that SPOP is required for embryo implantation and for endometrial decidualization. Molecular analysis revealed that expression levels of the PGR at the protein and transcript level are significantly reduced in the Spopd/d uterus. While this result was unexpected, this finding explains in part the dysfunctional phenotype of the Spopd/d uterus. Moderate increased levels of the ESR1, GATA2, and SRC2 were detected in the Spopd/d uterus, suggesting that SPOP is required to maintain the proteome for normal uterine function. With age, the Spopd/d endometrium exhibits large glandular cysts with foci of epithelial proliferation, further supporting a role for SPOP in maintaining a healthy uterus. Collectively, studies on the Spopd/d mouse support an important role for SPOP in normal uterine function and suggest that this mouse model may prove useful to study the role of SPOP-loss-of-function mutations in the etiopathogenesis of endometrial cancer.",2019,"Animals; Embryo Implantation; Endometrium; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Female; GATA2 Transcription Factor; Infertility; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Nuclear Proteins; Pregnancy; Repressor Proteins; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase Complexes; Uterus",16

Careful examination of primary breast cancers often reveals multiple genomically distinct subclones that may contain driver alterations that follow spatial patterns of segregation. Subclonality is of clinical relevance as it forms the substrate of selection and can give rise to aggressive clinical features such as invasiveness, metastasis and treatment resistance. However, spatial and temporal intra-tumoral heterogeneity pose fundamental challenges to representative sampling and consequently the feasibility of a personalized medicine approach.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate viral oncogene expression and viral integration sites in HPV16- and HPV18-positive squamous cell carcinoma lines. E6/E7 alternate transcripts were assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection of integrated papillomavirus sequences (DIPS-PCR) and sequencing identified viral insertion sites and affected host genes. Cellular gene expression was assessed across viral integration sites. All HPV-positive cell lines expressed alternate HPVE6/E7 splicing indicative of active viral oncogenesis. HPV integration occurred within cancer-related genes TP63, DCC, JAK1, TERT, ATR, ETV6, PGR, PTPRN2, and TMEM237 in 8 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) lines but UM-SCC-105 and UM-GCC-1 had only intergenic integration. HPV integration into cancer-related genes occurred in 7 of 9 HPV-positive cell lines and of these 6 were from tumors that progressed.

Understanding specific modes of epigenetic regulation can be used to identify novel biomarkers or targets for therapeutic intervention to clinically treat solid tumors and leukemias. The bivalent marking of gene promoters by H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 is a primary mechanism to poise genes for expression in pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESC). In this study we interrogated three well-established mammary cell lines to model epigenetic programming observed among breast cancer subtypes. Evidence is provided for a distinct bivalent signature, activating and repressive histone marks co-residing at the same gene promoter, in the MCF7 (ESR/PGR+) luminal breast cancer cell line. We identified a subset of genes, enriched for developmental pathways that regulate cellular phenotype and signaling, and partially recapitulate the bivalent character observed in ESC. We validated the biological relevance of this ""oncofetal epigenetic"" signature using data from ESR/PGR+ tumor samples from breast cancer patients. This signature of oncofetal epigenetic control is an informative biomarker and may provide novel therapeutic targets, selective for both recurring and treatment-resistant cancers. J. Cell.

However, the landscape of expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) and their role in charting EEC subgroups and determining clinical aggressiveness remain largely unknown. Using stringent criteria, we identified 1,931 expressed lncRNAs and predicted potential drivers through integrative analysis. Unsupervised clustering of lncRNA expression revealed three robust categories: basal-like, luminal-like and CTNNB1-enriched subgroups. Basal-like subgroup was enriched for aggressive tumors with higher pathological grade (p &lt; 0.0001), TNM stage (p = 0.01), and somatic mutations in trithorax-group genes (MLL, MLL2 and MLL3); and it overexpressed polycomb genes EZH2 and CBX2. In contrast to the luminal-like subgroup, progesterone (PGR) and estrogen receptor (ESR1) genes were highly down-regulated in the EEC basal-like subgroup. Consistent with its enrichment for CTNNB1 mutations (69%), lncRNA profile of the CTNNB1-enriched EEC subgroup was highly similar to that of the CTNNB1-enriched liver cancer subgroup. We performed integrative analysis of lncRNAs in EEC using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecular RNAseq profiles of 191 primary tumors for which genomic data were also available. We established lncRNA subgroup classification, correlated it with chromatin modifying gene expression, and described correlations between our lncRNA classification and clinico-genomic tumor features. Our results reveal the utility of systematic characterization of clinically annotated EEC in three clinically relevant subgroups.

In order to further clarify Twist's role in breast cancer, we detected Twist expression in breast cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry. Twist expression was observed in 54% (220/408) of breast cancer patients and was positively associated with tumor size, Ki67, VEGF-C and HER2 expression. Conversely, Twist was negatively associated with estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR) and E-cadherin expression. Patients with Twist expression had a poorer prognosis for 30-month disease free survival (DFS) (82.9%) than patients with negative Twist (92.3%). Overexpression of Twist led to dramatic changes in cellular morphology, proliferation, migratory/invasive capability, and expression of EMT-related biomarkers in breast cancer cells. Moreover, we show that Twist serves as a driver of tumorigenesis, as well as an inducer of EMT, at least in part, through activation of the Akt and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathways which are critical for Twist-mediated EMT.

Recent clinical studies suggest that epigenetic modulation by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors reverses hormone therapy resistance. However, little is known about epigenetic modulation of the ER during acquired hormone resistance. Our recent phase II study demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors re-sensitize hormone therapy-resistant tumors to the anti-estrogen tamoxifen. In this study, we sought to understand the mechanism behind the efficacy of this combination. We generated cell lines resistant to tamoxifen, named TAMRM and TAMRT, by continuous exposure of ER-positive MCF7 and T47D cells, respectively to 4-hydroxy tamoxifen for over 12&#xa0;months. HDAC inhibition, along with pharmacological and genetic manipulation of key survival pathways, including ER and Bcl-2, were used to characterize these resistant models. The TAMRM cells displayed decreased sensitivity to tamoxifen, fulvestrant and estrogen deprivation. Consistent with previous models, ER expression was retained and the gene harbored no mutations. Compared to parental MCF7 cells, ER expression in TAMRM was elevated, while progesterone receptor (PGR) was lost. Sensitivity of ER to ligands was greatly reduced and classic ER response genes were suppressed. This model conveyed tamoxifen resistance through transcriptional upregulation of Bcl-2 and c-Myc, and downregulation of the cell cycle checkpoint protein p21, manifesting in accelerated growth and reduced cell death. Similar to TAMRM cells, the TAMRT cell line exhibited substantially decreased tamoxifen sensitivity, increased ER and Bcl-2 expression and significantly reduced PGR expression. Treatment with HDAC inhibitors reversed the altered transcriptional events and reestablished the sensitivity of the ER to tamoxifen resulting in substantial Bcl-2 downregulation, growth arrest and apoptosis. Selective inhibition of Bcl-2 mirrored these effects in presence of an HDAC inhibitor. Our model implicates elevated ER and Bcl-2 as key drivers of anti-estrogen resistance, which can be reversed by epigenetic modulation through HDAC inhibition.",2015,"Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Estradiol; Female; Fulvestrant; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Histone Deacetylases; Humans; Ligands; Protein Binding; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Receptors, Estrogen; Tamoxifen; Transcription, Genetic; Transcriptome; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",16

We studied the impact of ER and HER2 (co)-expression in&#xa0;a cohort of 1,187 patients with invasive breast cancer and compared disease characteristics among different groups according to ER and HER2 status. Age, tumor size, grade, nodal status, TNM stage, and metastatic sites were compared and significance determined using the appropriate t tests. All p values were two-tailed. Compared to ER-negative/HER2-negative disease as the control group, ER expression was associated with older age, smaller tumors, lower grade, earlier TNM stage, and increased bone involvement in de novo metastasis, while HER2 had no significant impact on these characteristics. ER and HER2 co-expression was&#xa0;associated with lower grade and higher bone involvement in de novo metastasis, reflecting a retained impact for ER. HER2 impact on ER-positive disease was reflected by younger age, higher grade and&#xa0;TNM stage, and increased frequency of visceral involvement in de novo metastasis. Within the ER-positive/HER2-positive group, triple positive breast cancer (ER+/PgR+/HER2+) was associated with younger age compared to ER+/PgR-/HER2+ disease (mean age of 50.8 vs. 56&#xa0;years, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0226). PgR was also associated with younger age in ER+/HER2- disease with a mean age of 57.6&#xa0;years in ER+/PgR+/HER2- disease vs. 63.4&#xa0;years in ER+/PgR-/HER2- disease (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001). In conclusion,&#xa0;ER has a profound impact on breast cancer characteristics, including a retained impact when co-expressed with HER2. Similarly, HER2 dramatically modulates ER-positive breast cancer making it more aggressive. PgR association with young age may be related to hormonal levels of the premenopausal state, with HER2 providing an earlier growth advantage in triple positive disease, suggesting a specific dependence for this subset on high estrogen levels.",2015,"Biomarkers, Tumor; Biomedical Research; Bone Neoplasms; Brain Neoplasms; Breast Neoplasms; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Liver Neoplasms; Lung Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptors, Progesterone",16

TP53 mutation status is known as a core determinant of survival in breast cancer. The pathways disrupted in association with TP53 mutation status in tumours are not well characterised. In this study, we stratify breast cancers based on their TP53 mutation status and identify the set of dysregulated tumorigenic pathways and corresponding candidate driver genes using breast cancer gene expression profiles. Expressions of these genes were evaluated for their effect on patient survival first in univariate models, followed by multivariate models with TP53 status as a covariate. The most strongly differentially enriched pathways between breast cancers stratified by TP53 mutation status include in addition to TP53 signalling, several known cancer pathways involved in renal, prostate, pancreatic, colorectal, lung and other cancers, and signalling pathways such as calcium signalling, MAPK, ERBB and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling pathways. We found that mutant TP53 in conjunction with active estrogen receptor (ER) signalling significantly influence survival. We also found that upregulation of VEGFA mRNA levels in association with active ER signalling is a significant marker for poor survival, even in the presence of wild-type TP53. Mutation status of TP53 in breast cancer involves wide ranging derangement of several pathways. Among the candidate genes of the significantly deranged pathways, we identified VEGFA expression as an important marker of survival even when controlled by TP53 mutation status. Interestingly, independent of the TP53 mutation status, the survival effect of VEGFA was found significant in patients with active ER signalling (ER/PgR+), but not in those with ER/PgR- status. Therefore, we propose more studies to focus on the role of complex interplay between TP53, ER and VEGF signalling from therapeutic and prognostic context in breast cancer.",2013,"Breast Neoplasms; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Female; Humans; Mutation; RNA, Messenger; Receptors, Estrogen; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Up-Regulation; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",16

We report here that 1 can be transformed into anti-estrogenic ligands by simple alkyl substitutions of the 7-hydroxyl hydrogen. To test the effect of such structural modifications on the hormonal activities of the resulting compounds, a series of daidzein analogues have been designed and synthesized. When MCF-7 cells were treated with the analogues, those resulting from hydrogen substitution by isopropyl (3d), isobutyl (3f), cyclopentyl (3g), and pyrano- (2) inhibited cell proliferation, estrogen-induced transcriptional activity, and estrogen receptor (ER) regulated progesterone receptor (PgR) gene expression. However, methyl (3a) and ethyl (3b) substitutions of the hydroxyl proton only led to moderate reduction of the estrogenic activities. These results demonstrated the structural requirements for the transformation of daidzein from an ER agonist to an antagonist.

Pre-B ALL originates from a committed pre-B cell or an earlier progenitor, with potential to reprogram into other hematopoietic lineages. Here we report changes in lineage markers including myeloid conversion in patients following CD19 CAR therapy. Using murine ALL models we study the long-term effects of CD19 CAR-T cells and demonstrate partial or complete lineage switch as a consistent mechanism of CAR resistance depending on the underlying genetic oncogenic driver.

35192609,NR5A2,10.1371/journal.pgen.1010088,Lrh1 can help reprogram sexual cell fate and is required for Sertoli cell development and spermatogenesis in the mouse testis.,"The mammalian nuclear hormone receptors LRH1 (NR5A2) and SF1 (NR5A1) are close paralogs that can bind the same DNA motif and play crucial roles in gonadal development and function. Lrh1 is essential for follicle development in the ovary and has been proposed to regulate steroidogenesis in the testis. Lrh1 expression in the testis is highly elevated by loss of the sex regulator Dmrt1, which triggers male-to-female transdifferentiation of Sertoli cells. While Sf1 has a well-defined and crucial role in testis development, no function for Lrh1 in the male gonad has been reported. Here we use conditional genetics to examine Lrh1 requirements both in gonadal cell fate reprogramming and in normal development of the three major cell lineages of the mouse testis. We find that loss of Lrh1 suppresses sexual transdifferentiation, confirming that Lrh1 can act as a key driver in reprogramming sexual cell fate. In otherwise wild-type testes, we find that Lrh1 is dispensable in Leydig cells but is required in Sertoli cells for their proliferation, for seminiferous tubule morphogenesis, for maintenance of the blood-testis barrier, for feedback regulation of androgen production, and for support of spermatogenesis. Expression profiling identified misexpressed genes likely underlying most aspects of the Sertoli cell phenotype. In the germ line we found that Lrh1 is required for maintenance of functional spermatogonia, and hence mutants progressively lose spermatogenesis. Reduced expression of the RNA binding factor Nxf2 likely contributes to the SSC defect. Unexpectedly, however, over time the Lrh1 mutant germ line recovered abundant spermatogenesis and fertility. This finding indicates that severe germ line depletion triggers a response allowing mutant spermatogonia to recover the ability to undergo complete spermatogenesis. Our results demonstrate that Lrh1, like Sf1, is an essential regulator of testis development and function but has a very distinct repertoire of functions.",2022,Animals; Female; Male; Mammals; Mice; Sertoli Cells; Sex Differentiation; Spermatogenesis; Spermatogonia; Testis,3

We review how their integrated actions with each other, shared co-factors and other transcription factors are disrupted in cancer. Steroid hormone nuclear receptors are oncogenic drivers in breast and prostate cancer and blockade of signaling is a major therapeutic goal. By contrast to blockade of receptors, in other cancers enhanced receptor function is attractive, as illustrated initially with targeting of retinoic acid receptors in leukemia. In the post-genomic era large consortia, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, have developed a remarkable volume of genomic data with which to examine multiple aspects of nuclear receptor status in a pan-cancer manner. Therefore to extend the review of NR function we have also undertaken bioinformatics analyses of NR expression in over 3000 tumors, spread across six different tumor types (bladder, breast, colon, head and neck, liver and prostate). Specifically, to ask how the NR expression was distorted (altered expression, mutation and CNV) we have applied bootstrapping approaches to simulate data for comparison, and also compared these NR findings to 12 other transcription factor families. Nuclear receptors were uniquely and uniformly downregulated across all six tumor types, more than predicted by chance. These approaches also revealed that each tumor type had a specific NR expression profile but these were most similar between breast and prostate cancer. Some NRs were down-regulated in at least five tumor types (e.g. <i>NR3C2/MR</i> and <i>NR5A2/LRH-1</i>)) whereas others were uniquely down-regulated in one tumor (e.g. <i>NR1B3/RARG</i>).

The goal of current research is to find effective diagnostic and prognostic markers and to clarify their related mechanisms. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we integrated GC DNA methylation data from publicly available datasets obtained from TCGA and GEO databases, and applied random forest and LASSO analysis methods to screen reliable differential methylation sites (DMSs) for GC diagnosis. We constructed a diagnostic model of GC by logistic analysis and conducted verification and clinical correlation analysis. We screened credible prognostic DMSs through univariate Cox and LASSO analyses and verified a prognostic model of GC by multivariate Cox analysis. Independent prognostic and biological function analyses were performed for the prognostic risk score. We performed TP53 correlation analysis, mutation and prognosis analysis on eleven-DNA methylation driver gene (DMG), and constructed a multifactor regulatory network of key genes. <b>Results:</b> The five-DMS diagnostic model distinguished GC from normal samples, and diagnostic risk value was significantly correlated with grade and tumor location. The prediction accuracy of the eleven-DMS prognostic model was verified in both the training and validation datasets, indicating its certain potential for GC survival prediction. The survival rate of the high-risk group was significantly lower than that of the low-risk group. The prognostic risk score was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of GC, which was significantly correlated with N stage and tumor location, positively correlated with the VIM gene, and negatively correlated with the CDH1 gene. The expression of CHRNB2 decreased significantly in the TP53 mutation group of gastric cancer patients, and there were significant differences in CCDC69, RASSF2, CHRNB2, ARMC9, and RPN1 between the TP53 mutation group and the TP53 non-mutation group of gastric cancer patients. In addition, CEP290, UBXN8, KDM4A, RPN1 had high frequency mutations and the function of eleven-DMG mutation related genes in GC patients is widely enriched in multiple pathways. <b>Conclusion:</b> Combined, the five-DMS diagnostic and eleven-DMS prognostic GC models are important tools for accurate and individualized treatment.

We aimed to address the limited understanding of clinical and genetic factors that influence outcome in a cohort of patients with T-ALL induction failure (IF). We studied all cases of T-ALL IF on two consecutive multinational randomized trials, UKALL2003 and UKALL2011, to define risk factors, treatment, and outcomes. We performed multiomic profiling to characterize the genomic landscape. IF occurred in 10.3% of cases and was significantly associated with increasing age, occurring in 20% of patients age 16 years and older. Five-year overall survival (OS) rates were 52.1% in IF and 90.2% in responsive patients (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Despite increased use of nelarabine-based chemotherapy consolidated by hematopoietic stem-cell transplant in UKALL2011, there was no improvement in outcome.

There was a remarkable abundance of TAL1 noncoding lesions, associated with a dismal outcome (5-year OS, 12.5%). Combining TAL1 lesions with mutations in the MYC and RAS pathways produces a genetic stratifier that identifies patients highly likely to fail conventional therapy (5-year OS, 23.1% <i>v</i> 86.4%; HR, 6.84; 95% CI, 2.78 to 16.78; <i>P</i> &lt; .0001) and who should therefore be considered for experimental agents.

STIL has been found disordered in multiple cancers and driven carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of STIL in cancers remain ambiguous. Here, we systematically analyzed the genetic alterations, molecular mechanisms, and clinical relevance of STIL across &gt;10,000 samples representing 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. We found that STIL expression is up-regulated in most cancer types compared with their adjacent normal tissues. The expression dysregulation of STIL was affected by copy number variation, mutation, and DNA methylation. High STIL expression was associated with worse outcomes and promoted the progression of cancers. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) further revealed that STIL is involved in cell cycle progression, Mitotic spindle, G2M checkpoint, and E2F targets pathways across cancer types. STIL expression was negatively correlated with multiple genes taking part in ciliogenesis and was positively correlated with several genes which participated with centrosomal duplication or cilia degradation. Moreover, STIL silencing could promote primary cilia formation and inhibit cell cycle protein expression in prostate and kidney cancer cell lines. The phenotype and protein expression alteration due to STIL silencing could be reversed by IFT88 silencing in cancer cells. These results revealed that STIL could regulate the cell cycle through primary cilia in tumor cells. In summary, our results revealed the importance of STIL in cancers.

Several transcription factors (TFs) have also been reported to regulate the antitumor activity and immune cell infiltration. This study aimed to quantify the populations of different immune cells infiltrated in tumor samples based on the bulk RNA sequencing data obtained from 50 cancer patients using the CIBERSORT and the EPIC algorithm. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) identified eigengene modules strongly associated with tumorigenesis and the activation of CD4+ memory T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages.

The analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer data confirmed these findings and further showed that the expression of these potential TF genes regulating immune infiltration, and the immune-related genes that they regulated, was associated with the survival of patients within multiple cancers. Exome-seq was performed on 24 paired samples that also had RNA-seq data. The expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis showed that mutations were significantly more frequent in the regions flanking the TF genes compared with those of non-TF genes, suggesting a driver role of these TF genes regulating immune infiltration.

The spectrum of RUNX1 mutations has led to the notion that it acts as a tumor suppressor in this context; however, other studies have placed RUNX1, along with transcription factors TAL1 and NOTCH1, as core drivers of an oncogenic transcriptional program. To reconcile these divergent roles, we knocked down RUNX1 in human T-ALL cell lines and deleted Runx1 or Cbfb in primary mouse T-cell leukemias. RUNX1 depletion consistently resulted in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. RUNX1 upregulated variable sets of target genes in each cell line, but consistently included a core set of oncogenic effectors including insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and NRAS. Our results support the conclusion that RUNX1 has a net positive effect on cell growth in the context of established T-ALL.",2019,"Animals; Cell Division; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Size; Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit; Core Binding Factor beta Subunit; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Heterografts; Humans; Leukemia, Experimental; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; Neoplasm Proteins; Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; Transcription, Genetic; Transcriptome; Tumor Burden",15

Single-cell multicolour FISH was used to demonstrate that the earliest detectable leukaemia subclone contained the STIL-TAL1 fusion and copy number loss of 9p21.3 (CDKN2A/CDKN2B locus), with other copy number alterations including loss of PTEN occurring as secondary subclonal events. In three cases, multiplex qPCR and phylogenetic analysis were used to produce branching evolutionary trees recapitulating the snapshot history of T-ALL evolution in this leukaemia subtype, which confirmed that mutations in key T-ALL drivers, including NOTCH1 and PTEN, were subclonal and reiterative in distinct subclones. Xenografting confirmed that self-renewing or propagating cells were genetically diverse. These data suggest that the STIL-TAL1 fusion is a likely founder or truncal event.

Recently, the next-generation sequencing approach has allowed systematic identification of molecular features in pediatric T-ALL. Here, by performing RNA-sequencing and other genomewide analysis, we investigated the genomic landscape in 61 adult and 69 pediatric T-ALL cases. Thirty-six distinct gene fusion transcripts were identified, with <i>SET-NUP214</i> being highly related to adult cases. Among 18 previously unknown fusions, <i>ZBTB16-ABL1</i>, <i>TRA-SALL2</i>, and involvement of <i>NKX2-1</i> were recurrent events. <i>ZBTB16-ABL1</i> functioned as a leukemogenic driver and responded to the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Among 48 genes with mutation rates &gt;3%, 6 were newly found in T-ALL. An aberrantly overexpressed short mRNA transcript of the <i>SLC17A9</i> gene was revealed in most cases with overexpressed <i>TAL1</i>, which predicted a poor prognosis in the adult group. Up-regulation of <i>HOXA</i>, <i>MEF2C</i>, and <i>LYL1</i> was often present in adult cases, while <i>TAL1</i> overexpression was detected mainly in the pediatric group. Although most gene fusions were mutually exclusive, they coexisted with gene mutations. These genetic abnormalities were correlated with deregulated gene expression markers in three subgroups.

In human TAL1-driven T-ALL cell lines, Trib2 is proposed to function as an important survival factor, but there is limited information about the role of Trib2 in primary T-ALL. In this study, we investigated the role of Trib2 in the initiation and maintenance of Notch-dependent T-ALL. Trib2 had no effect on the growth and survival of murine T-ALL cell lines in vitro when expression was blocked by shRNAs. To test the function of Trib2 on leukemogenesis in vivo, we generated Trib2 knockout mice. Mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequencies without gross developmental anomalies. Adult mice did not develop pathology or shortened survival, and hematopoiesis, including T cell development, was unperturbed. Using a retroviral model of Notch-induced T-ALL, deletion of Trib2 unexpectedly decreased the latency and increased the penetrance of T-ALL development in vivo. Immunoblotting of primary murine T-ALL cells showed that the absence of Trib2 increased C/EBP&#x3b1; expression, a known regulator of cell proliferation, and did not alter AKT or ERK phosphorylation. Although Trib2 was suggested to be highly expressed in T-ALL, transcriptomic analysis of two independent T-ALL cohorts showed that low Trib2 expression correlated with the TLX1-expressing cortical mature T-ALL subtype, whereas high Trib2 expression correlated with the LYL1-expressing early immature T-ALL subtype.

Whereas driver mutations in protein-coding genes can be distinguished from passenger mutations based on their recurrence, non-coding mutations are usually not recurrent at the same position. Therefore, it is still unclear how to identify cis-regulatory driver mutations, particularly when chromatin data from the same patient is not available, thus relying only on sequence and expression information. Here we use machine-learning methods to predict functional regulatory regions using sequence information alone, and compare the predicted activity of the mutated region with the reference sequence. This way we define the Predicted Regulatory Impact of a Mutation in an Enhancer (PRIME). We find that the recently identified driver mutation in the TAL1 enhancer has a high PRIME score, representing a ""gain-of-target"" for MYB, whereas the highly recurrent TERT promoter mutation has a surprisingly low PRIME score. We trained Random Forest models for 45 cancer-related transcription factors, and used these to score variations in the HeLa genome and somatic mutations across more than five hundred cancer genomes. Each model predicts only a small fraction of non-coding mutations with a potential impact on the function of the encompassing regulatory region. Nevertheless, as these few candidate driver mutations are often linked to gains in chromatin activity and gene expression, they may contribute to the oncogenic program by altering the expression levels of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.",2016,"Algorithms; Binding Sites; Computational Biology; Genome; HeLa Cells; Humans; Machine Learning; Models, Statistical; Mutation; Neoplasms; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Transcription Factors",15

Cis-regulatory elements play an important role in gene regulation, with mutations in these elements potentially resulting in changes to the expression of linked genes. The recent discoveries of recurrent TERT promoter mutations in melanoma, and recurrent mutations that create a super-enhancer regulating TAL1 expression in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), have sparked significant interest in the search for other somatic cis-regulatory mutations driving cancer development. In this review, we look more closely at the TERT promoter and TAL1 enhancer alterations and use these examples to ask whether other cis-regulatory mutations may play a role in cancer susceptibility. In doing so, we make observations from the data emerging from recent research in this field, and describe the experimental and analytical approaches which could be adopted in the hope of better uncovering the true functional significance of somatic cis-regulatory mutations in cancer.",2016,"cancer; cis-regulation; enhancer; promoter; somatic mutation; Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; DNA Mutational Analysis; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome, Human; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Mutation; Neoplasms; Phenotype; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid",15

Accordingly, MYC is recognized as a major driver of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in human and zebrafish/mouse models, and uncovering the context by which MYC-mediated malignant transformation initiates and develops remains a considerable challenge. Because MYC is a very complex oncogene, highly dependent on the microenvironment and cell-intrinsic context, we generated transgenic mice (tgMyc(spo)) in which ectopic Myc activation occurs sporadically (&lt;10(-6) thymocytes) within otherwise normal thymic environment, thereby mimicking the unicellular context in which oncogenic alterations initiate human tumors. We show that while Myc(+) clones in tgMyc(spo) mice develop and initially proliferate in thymus and the periphery, no tumor or clonal expansion progress in aging mice (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;130), suggesting an unexpectedly low ability of Myc to initiate efficient tumorigenesis. Furthermore, to determine the relevance of this observation in human pathogenesis we analyzed a human T-ALL case at diagnosis and relapse using the molecular stigmata of V(D)J recombination as markers of malignant progression; we similarly demonstrate that despite the occurrence of TAL1 and MYC translocations in early thymocyte ontogeny, subsequent oncogenic alterations were required to drive oncogenesis. Altogether, our data suggest that although central to T-ALL, MYC overexpression per se is inefficient in triggering the cascade of events leading to malignant transformation.",2014,"Animals; Blast Crisis; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Genes, myc; HeLa Cells; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Recurrence; Translocation, Genetic; V(D)J Recombination",15

Although first identified in association with a chromosomal translocation in T-ALL, the ectopic expression of LMO1 occurs far more frequently in the absence of any known mutation involving its locus. Given that LMO1 is barely expressed in any haematopoietic lineage, and activation of transcriptional drivers in leukaemic cells is not well described, we investigated the regulation of this gene in normal haematopoietic and leukaemic cells. We show that LMO1 has two promoters that drive reporter gene expression in transgenic mice to neural tissues known to express endogenous LMO1. The LMO1 promoters display bivalent histone marks in multiple blood lineages including T-cells, and a 3' flanking region at LMO1 +57 contains a transcriptional enhancer that is active in developing blood cells in transgenic mouse embryos. The LMO1 promoters become activated in T-ALL together with the 3' enhancer, which is bound in primary T-ALL cells by SCL/TAL1 and GATA3. Taken together, our results show that LMO1 is poised for expression in normal progenitors, where activation of SCL/TAL1 together with a breakdown of epigenetic repression of LMO1 regulatory elements induces ectopic LMO1 expression that contributes to the development and maintenance of T-ALL.",2013,"Animals; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Humans; LIM Domain Proteins; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Oncogenes; Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Transcription Factors",15

However, toxicities and resistance to anti-angiogenics can limit their use making identification of new targets vital. Inhibin, a heteromeric TGF&#x3b2; ligand, is a contextual regulator of tumor progression acting as an early tumor suppressor, yet also an established biomarker for ovarian cancers. Here, we find that hypoxia increases inhibin levels in ovarian cancer cell lines, xenograft tumors, and patients. Inhibin is regulated primarily through HIF-1, shifting the balance under hypoxia from activins to inhibins. Hypoxia regulated inhibin promotes tumor growth, endothelial cell invasion and permeability. Targeting inhibin in vivo through knockdown and anti-inhibin strategies robustly reduces permeability in vivo and alters the balance of pro and anti-angiogenic mechanisms resulting in vascular normalization. Mechanistically, inhibin regulates permeability by increasing VE-cadherin internalization via ACVRL1 and CD105, a receptor complex that we find to be stabilized directly by inhibin. Our findings demonstrate direct roles for inhibins in vascular normalization via TGF-&#x3b2; receptors providing new insights into the therapeutic significance of inhibins as a strategy to normalize the tumor vasculature in ovarian cancer.",2022,"Activin Receptors, Type II; Activins; Capillary Permeability; Female; Humans; Hypoxia; Inhibins; Ovarian Neoplasms",3

Clonal somatic mutations including JAK2V617F, the most frequent driver mutation among myeloproliferative neoplasms, have recently been identified in healthy individuals without hematological disorders. Here, we reveal that clonal hematopoiesis with JAK2V617F exacerbates PH and pulmonary arterial remodeling in mice. JAK2V617F-expressing neutrophils specifically accumulate in pulmonary arterial regions, accompanied by increases in neutrophil-derived elastase activity and chemokines in chronic hypoxia-exposed JAK2V617F transgenic (JAK2<sup>V617F</sup>) mice, as well as recipient mice transplanted with JAK2<sup>V617F</sup> bone marrow cells. JAK2V617F progressively upregulates Acvrl1 (encoding ALK1) during the differentiation from bone marrow stem/progenitor cells peripherally into mature neutrophils of pulmonary arterial regions. JAK2V617F-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation upregulates ALK1-Smad1/5/8 signaling. ALK1/2 inhibition completely prevents the development of PH in JAK2<sup>V617F</sup> mice. Finally, our prospective clinical study identified JAK2V617F-positive clonal hematopoiesis is more common in PH patients than in healthy subjects.

Knowledge about the molecular profiles of SCAs mostly comes from intracranial glioma; the pattern of genetic alterations of SCAs is not well understood. Herein, we describe genome-sequencing analyses of primary SCAs, aiming to characterize the mutational landscape of primary SCAs. We utilized whole exome sequencing (WES) to analyze somatic nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) among 51 primary SCAs. Driver genes were searched using four algorithms. GISTIC2 was used to detect significant CNVs. Additionally, recurrently mutated pathways were also summarized. A total of 12 driver genes were identified. Of those, H3F3A (47.1%), TP53 (29.4%), NF1 (19.6%), ATRX (17.6%), and PPM1D (17.6%) were the most frequently mutated genes. Furthermore, three novel driver genes seldom reported in glioma were identified: HNRNPC, SYNE1, and RBM10. Several germline mutations, including three variants (SLC16A8 rs2235573, LMF1 rs3751667, FAM20C rs774848096) that were associated with risk of brain glioma, were frequently observed in SCAs. Moreover, 12q14.1 (13.7%) encompassing the oncogene CDK4 was recurrently amplified and negatively affected patient prognosis. Besides frequently mutated RTK/RAS pathway and PI3K pathway, the cell cycle pathway controlling the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (RB) was mutated in 39.2% of patients.

Although researches have shown mutations in driver genes, copy number variations (CNV) and alterations in relevant signaling pathways promoted the tumor evolution and immune escape during colorectal liver metastasis (CLM), the underlying mechanism remains largely elusive. Tumor and matched metastatic tissues were collected from 16 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer and subjected to whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for studying colorectal cancer clonal evolution and immune escape during CLM. Shared somatic mutations between primary and metastatic tissues with a commonly observed subclonal-clonal (S-C) changing pattern indicated a common clonal origin between two lesions. The recurrent mutations with S-C changing pattern included those in KRAS, SYNE1, CACNA1H, PCLO, FBXL2, and DNAH11. The main CNV events underwent clonal-clonal evolution (20q amplification (amp), 17p deletion (del), 18q del and 8p del), subclonal-clonal evolution (8q amp, 13q amp, 8p del) and metastasis-specific evolution (8q amp) during the process of CLM. In addition, we revealed a potential mechanism of tumor cell immune escape by analyzing human leukocytes antigens (HLA) related clonal neoantigens and immune cell components in CLM.

Herein, we present our experience with ESRD kidneys, with emphasis on ACKD-RCC, associated cysts, and the somatic mutation analysis of a subset of ACKD-RCCs using next-generation sequencing. Our data on 59 cases with ESRD that underwent nephrectomy, shows that ACKD-RCC represents more than half of the tumors (25/46; 54%) developing in ESRD, followed by papillary RCC (13; 28%). History of dialysis, male sex, and African American race were potential risk factors for developing ACKD-RCCs. Further, ACKD-RCC-like cysts are possible precursors of RCCs in the ACKD setting noted in 40 of 46 (87%) cases with tumors. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed recurrent mutations in the KMT2C gene in 4 of 5 ACKD-RCCs (80%), exclusively exhibiting cribriform ""sieve-like"" morphology; whereas the case negative for KMT2C mutations exhibited ""type 2"" papillary RCC morphology and lacked ""sieve-like"" growth pattern. Pathogenic mutations in TSC2 were the second common abnormality (3/5; 60%), often coexisting with KMT2C mutations. Deleterious mutations in additional genes such as CBL, PDGFRA, and SYNE1, etc. were noted but were nonrecurrent and always coexisted with mutations in KMT2C or TSC2. To conclude, our study highlights that mutations in a chromatin-modifying gene KMT2C may potentially be oncogenic drivers for the development of ACKD-RCC with classic sieve-like morphology. In addition, pathogenic mutations in TSC2 possibly play a role in the development of cysts/tumors in a subset of ACKD patients. If corroborated in larger cohorts, these findings would be useful in planning surveillance and early intervention in ESRD patients developing ACKD.",2020,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Humans; Kidney Diseases, Cystic; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein",14

To identify the genetic and epigenetic alterations determining this diversity, we used whole-genome (n = 61) and exome (n = 21) sequencing (74% cMCL, 26% nnMCL) combined with transcriptome and DNA methylation profiles in the context of 5 MCL reference epigenomes. We identified that open and active chromatin at the major translocation cluster locus might facilitate the t(11;14)(q13;32), which modifies the 3-dimensional structure of the involved regions. This translocation is mainly acquired in precursor B cells mediated by recombination-activating genes in both MCL subtypes, whereas in 8% of cases the translocation occurs in mature B cells mediated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase. We identified novel recurrent MCL drivers, including CDKN1B, SAMHD1, BCOR, SYNE1, HNRNPH1, SMARCB1, and DAZAP1. Complex structural alterations emerge as a relevant early oncogenic mechanism in MCL, targeting key driver genes. Breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and translocations activated oncogenes (BMI1, MIR17HG, TERT, MYC, and MYCN), generating gene amplifications and remodeling regulatory regions. cMCL carried significant higher numbers of structural variants, copy number alterations, and driver changes than nnMCL, with exclusive alterations of ATM in cMCL, whereas TP53 and TERT alterations were slightly enriched in nnMCL. Several drivers had prognostic impact, but only TP53 and MYC aberrations added value independently of genomic complexity. An increasing genomic complexity, together with the presence of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and high DNA methylation changes related to the proliferative cell history, defines patients with different clinical evolution.",2021,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cell Proliferation; Cyclin D1; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Rearrangement; Genomics; Humans; Immunoglobulins; Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation",14

The Chinese papillary thyroid carcinoma tumors harbored somatic mutations in the known driver genes, such as KRAS, TP53, BRAF, ERBB2 , and MET . In addition, we identified novel papillary thyroid carcinoma candidate genes that had not been well studied before. We also identified a gene mutation signature involving SPTA1, MAP2, SYNE1 , and SLIT3 that is significantly associated with survival of papillary thyroid carcinoma patients. Transcriptome analysis using the initial papillary thyroid carcinoma tumor samples and a new Chinese papillary thyroid carcinoma dataset identified six commonly upregulated oncogenic pathways in both datasets including eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine kinase (AKT), Ephrin Receptor, Rho Family GTPase signaling, nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress response, and remodeling of epithelial adherens junctions. Overall, we identified novel candidate genes and oncogenic pathways important to the etiology of papillary thyroid carcinoma in Chinese patients and found the association of a gene signature with the survival outcome of the thyroid cancer patients. These findings may help in moving toward the more comprehensive and effective personalized treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma in Chinese.",2023,"Humans; Thyroid Cancer, Papillary; East Asian People; Thyroid Neoplasms; Mutation; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing",14

However, the underlying genetic defects of the non-mutant cases are still unknown. Using a 409 gene panel, we employed targeted next generation sequencing to investigate the mutational landscape in a cohort of seven PI3K/AKT-negative cases and five cases with known hotspot mutations in either PIK3CA or AKT1. In total, we identified 29 mutations in 22 of 409 genes. The four cases with PIK3CA hotspot mutations carried no or only few additional mutations. The AKT1 hotspot mutated case harboured additional mutations in four genes (SYNE1, ADAMTS20, EP400 and CASC5). At least two of these genes are involved in or contribute to the PI3K/AKT-pathway. In the seven non-hotspot mutated cases we observed 18 mutations. Each case carried at least one mutation in a gene contributing to or involved in PI3K/AKT-signalling. Affected genes were PIK3CA (n=1, non-hotspot mutation), PIK3R1 (n=3), SYNE1, AR, IL6ST, PDGFRB, KMT2C, AR, BTK, DST, KAT6A, BRD3, RNF213, USP9X, ADGRB3, MAGI1, and IL7R (each gene mutated once). The identified PIK3CA and PIK3R1 mutations lead to constitutive activated PI3K/AKT-signalling. In conclusion, we demonstrate the genetic basis of HP in all cases.

However, despite the wide number of alterations until now reported in PCCs, it is likely that other susceptibility genes remain still unknown, especially for those PCCs not clearly syndromic. Whole exome sequencing of tumor DNA was performed on a set of twelve PCCs clinically defined as sporadic. About 50% of PCCs examined had somatic mutations on the known susceptibility <i>VHL</i>, <i>NF1</i>, and <i>RET</i> genes. In addition to these driver events, mutations on <i>SYNE1</i>, <i>ABCC10</i>, and <i>RAD54B</i> genes were also detected. Moreover, extremely rare germline variants were present in half of the sporadic PCC samples analyzed, in particular variants of <i>MAX</i> and <i>SAMD9L</i> were detected in the germline of cases wild-type for mutations in the known susceptibility genes. Additional somatic passenger mutations can be associated with known susceptibility <i>VHL</i>, <i>NF1</i>, and <i>RET</i> genes in PCCs, and a wide number of germline variants with still unknown clinical significance can be detected in these patients. Therefore, many efforts should be aimed to better define the pathogenetic role of all these germline variants for discovering novel potential therapeutic targets for this disease still orphan of effective treatments.",2022,NA,14

As each type of cancer is different and exhibits unique alteration patterns, identifying and characterizing gene alterations in CRC that may serve as biomarkers might help to improve diagnosis, prognosis and predict potential response to therapy. With the emergence of next generation sequencing technologies (NGS), it is now possible to extensively and rapidly identify the gene profile of individual tumors. In this study, we aimed to identify actionable somatic alterations in Dukes' B and C in CRC via NGS. Targeted sequencing of 409 cancer-related genes using the Ion Ampliseq<sup>TM</sup> Comprehensive Cancer Panel was performed on genomic DNA obtained from paired fresh frozen tissues, cancer and normal, of Dukes' B (<i>n</i> = 10) and Dukes' C (<i>n</i> = 9) CRC. The sequencing results were analyzed using Torrent Suite, annotated using ANNOVAR and validated using Sanger sequencing. A total of 141 somatic non-synonymous sequence variations were identified in 86 genes. Among these, 64 variants (45%) were predicted to be deleterious, 38 variants (27%) possibly deleterious while the other 39 variants (28%) have low or neutral protein impact. Seventeen genes have alterations with frequencies of &#x2265;10% in the patient cohort and with 14 overlapped genes in both Dukes' B and C. The adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) was the most frequently altered gene in both groups (<i>n</i> = 6 in Dukes' B and C). In addition, <i>TP53</i> was more frequently altered in Dukes' C (<i>n</i> = 7) compared to Dukes' B (<i>n</i> = 4). Ten variants in <i>APC</i>, namely p.R283<sup>&#x2217;</sup>, p.N778fs, p.R805<sup>&#x2217;</sup>, p.Y935fs, p.E941fs, p.E1057<sup>&#x2217;</sup>, p.I1401fs, p.Q1378<sup>&#x2217;</sup>, p.E1379<sup>&#x2217;</sup>, and p.A1485fs were predicted to be driver variants. APC remains as the most frequently altered gene in the intermediate stages of CRC. Wnt signaling pathway is the major affected pathway followed by P53, RAS, TGF-&#x3b2;, and PI3K signaling. We reported the alteration profiles in each of the patient which has the potential to affect the clinical decision. We believe that this study will add further to the understanding of CRC molecular landscape.",2020,APC; Ion Ampliseq Comprehensive Cancer Panel; SYNE1; colorectal cancer; next generation sequencing; precision medicine,14

The effects of those alterations on the fitness of somatic cells lead to evolutionary adaptations such as increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and altered anticancer drug responses. However, there are few general mathematical models to quantitatively examine how perturbations of a single gene shape subsequent evolution of the cancer genome. In this study, we proposed the gene gravity model to study the evolution of cancer genomes by incorporating the genome-wide transcription and somatic mutation profiles of ~3,000 tumors across 9 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas into a broad gene network. We found that somatic mutations of a cancer driver gene may drive cancer genome evolution by inducing mutations in other genes. This functional consequence is often generated by the combined effect of genetic and epigenetic (e.g., chromatin regulation) alterations. By quantifying cancer genome evolution using the gene gravity model, we identified six putative cancer genes (AHNAK, COL11A1, DDX3X, FAT4, STAG2, and SYNE1). The tumor genomes harboring the nonsynonymous somatic mutations in these genes had a higher mutation density at the genome level compared to the wild-type groups. Furthermore, we provided statistical evidence that hypermutation of cancer driver genes on inactive X chromosomes is a general feature in female cancer genomes. In summary, this study sheds light on the functional consequences and evolutionary characteristics of somatic mutations during tumorigenesis by propelling adaptive cancer genome evolution, which would provide new perspectives for cancer research and therapeutics.",2016,"Databases, Genetic; Female; Genome, Human; Genomics; Humans; Male; Models, Genetic; Mutation; Neoplasms",14

In addition to genetic aberrations, epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation are altered in cancer and impact gene expression. To identify epigenetic alterations in ALL, genome-wide methylation profiles were generated using the methylated CpG island recovery assay followed by next-generation sequencing. More than 25,000 differentially methylated regions (DMR) were observed in ALL patients with &#x223c; 90% present within intronic or intergenic regions. To determine the regulatory potential of the DMR, whole-transcriptome analysis was performed and integrated with methylation data. Aberrant promoter methylation was associated with the altered expression of genes involved in transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and proliferation. Novel enhancer-like sequences were identified within intronic and intergenic DMR. Aberrant methylation in these regions was associated with the altered expression of neighboring genes involved in cell cycle processes, lymphocyte activation and apoptosis. These genes include potential epi-driver genes, such as SYNE1, PTPRS, PAWR, HDAC9, RGCC, MCOLN2, LYN, TRAF3, FLT1, and MELK, which may provide a selective advantage to leukemic cells. In addition, the differential expression of epigenetic modifier genes, pseudogenes, and non-coding RNAs was also observed accentuating the role of erroneous epigenetic gene regulation in ALL.",2016,"DNA methylation; MIRA-seq; RNA-seq; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; enhancer; epigenetics; gene regulation; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Genome, Human; Humans; Infant; Male; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA",14

To address these issues, we used multigene high-coverage next-generation sequencing of 24 microsatellite-stable CRC primaries, matched normal tissue, and related multiple metastases to nodes, liver, lung, and brain with a CRC-specific gene panel to infer the degree of clonal evolution during metastatic progression of the disease. Somatic mutations were detected in 40% of CRC-related genes, and we observed a striking 100% genetic concordance between primary and multiple secondary sites for APC, KRAS, FBXW7, PIK3CA, BRAF, SMAD4, and ACVR2A. Except for true de novo mutations in 4 cases (affecting SYNE1, CTNNB1, TP53, and PTEN), all remaining cases (84.4%) shared the genetic lesions of the primary tumors with all investigated metastases irrespective of the site of metastasis or time lapse between primary tumor resection and the occurrence of metastatic spread. Putative biomarkers and druggable targets were identified in 25% of the cases. Our data proves that genetic alterations occurring early in CRC carcinogenesis are remarkably stable during metastatic progression, indicating (i) a very low degree of genetic heterogeneity between primary and multiple secondary sites with respect to CRC driver mutations and (ii) that genetic interrogation of archived primary tumor samples appears to be sufficient for the application of cancer precision medicine in the metastatic setting.",2015,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers, Tumor; Brain Neoplasms; Colorectal Neoplasms; DNA Mutational Analysis; Disease Progression; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Lung Neoplasms; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Microsatellite Repeats; Middle Aged; Mutation; Phenotype; Retrospective Studies",14

Tobacco chewing is implicated with most of the cases of HNSCC but this type of cancer is increasing in non-tobacco chewers as well. This study was instigated to provide comprehensive variant and gene-level data in HNSCC subjects of the Indian population and fill the gap in the literature on comparative assessment of gene mutations in cancer subjects with a habit of tobacco and those without any habit using targeted amplicon sequencing. We performed targeted Amplicon sequencing of 409 tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, frequently mutated across many cancer types, including head and neck. DNA from primary tumor tissues and matched blood was analyzed for HNSCC patients with a habit of tobacco and those without any habit. PDE4DIP, SYNE1, and NOTCH1 emerged as the highly mutated genes in HNSCC. A total of 39 candidate causal variants in 22 unique cancer driver genes were identified in non-habitual (WoH) and habitual (WH) subjects. Comparison of genes from both the subjects, showed seven unique cancer driver genes (KIT, ATM, RNF213, GATA2, DST, RET, CYP2C19) in WoH, while WH showed five (IL7R, PKHD1, MLL3, PTPRD, MAPK8) and 10 genes (SETD2, ATR, CDKN2A, NCOA4, TP53, SYNE1, KAT6B, THBS1, PTPRT, and FGFR3) were common to both subjects. In addition to this NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and NOTCH4 gene were found to be mutated only in habitual subjects. These findings strongly support a causal role for tobacco, acting via PI3K and MAPK pathway inhibition and stimulation of various genes leading to oncogenic transformations in case of tobacco chewers. In case of non-tobacco chewers it appears that mutations in the pathway affecting the squamous epithelial lineage and DNA repair genes lead to HNSCC. Somatic mutation in CYP2C19 gene in the non-habitual subjects suggests that this gene may have a tobacco independent role in development and progression of HNSCC. In addition to sharing high mutation rate, NOTCH gene family was found to be mutated only in habitual sample. Further, presence of mutated genes not earlier reported to be involved in HNSCC, suggest that the Indian sub-continent may have different sets of genes, as compared to other parts of the world, involved in the development and progression of HNSCC.",2020,Amplicon sequencing; Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; Mutation; Oncogenic transformations; Tobacco,14

The present study aimed to identify driver genes in RCC using a bioinformatics approach. GSE53757 and GSE40435 microarray data were analyzed, and differentially expressed genes were filtered prior to gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established. Overall survival and recurrence were investigated and based on data presented in cBioPortal. The COPS7B gene within the PPI network was selected for further study <i>in vitro</i>. The present study identified 174 and 149 genes possessing a significant signal to noise ratio in GSE53757 and GSE40435, respectively. In total, 53 of these genes were selected based upon inclusion in both datasets. GO analysis indicated that PRKCDBP, EHD2, KCNJ10, ATP1A1, KCNJ1 and EHD2 may be involved in various biological processes. Furthermore, ALDH6A1, LDHA, SUCLG1 and ABAT may be involved in the propanoate metabolism pathway. A network consisting of 106 genes, and one typical cluster were constructed. In addition, COPS7B was selected, as it was associated with decreased overall survival and increased recurrence rates, in order to elucidate its function in RCC. Furthermore, upregulation of COPS7B was demonstrated to be predictive of advanced stage disease and metastasis of RCC. Finally, COPS7B-knockdown inhibited RCC cell proliferation and invasion ability. Collectively, these results provided novel insights into COPS7B function, indicating that COPS7B may serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in RCC.",2020,COP9 signalosome subunit 7B; RCC; cBioportal; metastasis; protein-protein interaction,1

Although teratoma is usually curable, in rare cases it can give rise to various somatic tumors and exceptionally it undergoes melanocytic neuroectodermal tumor (MNT) transformation, a process that is not well-described. We report a patient with a postchemotherapy thymic teratoma associated with an MNT component who, 10 years later, additionally presented a vertebral metastasis corresponding to an anaplastic MNT. Using exome sequencing of the mature teratoma, the MNT and its metastatic vertebral anaplastic MNT components, we identified 19 somatic mutations shared by at least two components. Six mutations were common to all three components, and three of them were located in the known cancer-related genes <i>KRAS</i> (p.E63K), <i>TP53</i> (p.P222X), and <i>POLQ</i> (p.S447P). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the melanoma tumorigenesis pathway was enriched in mutated genes including the four major driver genes <i>KRAS</i>, <i>TP53</i>, <i>ERBB4</i>, and <i>KDR</i>, indicating that these genes may be involved in the development of the anaplastic MNT transformation of the teratoma.

The standard method for detecting chimeric TRK genes in tumor samples today is considered to be next generation sequencing with the determination of the prime structure of the chimeric transcripts. We hypothesized that expression of the chimeric tyrosine kinase proteins in tumors can determine the specific transcriptomic profile of tumor cells. We detected differentially expressed genes allowing distinguishing between TRK-dependent tumors papillary thyroid cancer (TC) from other molecular variants of tumors of this type. Using PCR with reverse transcription (RT-PCR), we identified 7 samples of papillary TC carrying a EVT6-NTRK3 rearrangement (7/215, 3.26%). Using machine learning and the data extracted from TCGA, we developed of a recognition function for predicting the presence of rearrangement in NTRK genes based on the expression of 10 key genes: AUTS2, DTNA, ERBB4, HDAC1, IGF1, KDR, NTRK1, PASK, PPP2R5B, and PRSS1. The recognition function was used to analyze the expression data of the above genes in 7 TRK-dependent and 10 TRK-independent thyroid tumors obtained by RT-PCR. On the test samples from TCGA, the sensitivity was 72.7%, the specificity - 99.6%. On our independent validation samples tested by RT-PCR, sensitivity was 100%, specificity - 70%. We proposed an mRNA profile of ten genes that can classify TC in relation to the presence of driver NTRK-chimeric TRK genes with acceptable sensitivity and specificity.",2022,"ETV6-NTRK3; NTRK; chimeric proteins; thyroid cancer; transcription; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Receptor, trkC; Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor; Repressor Proteins; Thyroid Cancer, Papillary; Thyroid Neoplasms",52

Novel selective RET inhibitors (RETi) that can overcome V804 gatekeeper mutations, endowing resistance to multikinase inhibitors (MKI) and, in particular, achieving KDR selectivity, are needed. In addition, the mechanisms underlying RET-inhibition-induced antiproliferative effects in the context of RET addiction are incompletely understood. This study describes a novel selective RETi, SYHA1815, which inhibited the kinase activity of RET wild type and V804 mutant with an IC<sub>50</sub> in the subnanomolar to nanomolar range. Notably, SYHA1815 exhibited approximately 20-fold selectivity for RET over KDR, almost equivalent to that of the launched selective inhibitor pralsetinib. SYHA1815 had only a marginal inhibitory effect on cellular KDR signaling at a high (200 nmol/L) concentration, confirming the selectivity over KDR. In addition, SYHA1815 exhibited a favorable selectivity profile, with greater than 100-fold selectivity for RET over 347 other kinases. It exhibited potent antitumor efficacy and overcame V804 mutations <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> by targeting RET. Then, using SYHA1815 as a probe, we found that RET inhibition suppressed RET-driven cell proliferation via G<sub>1</sub> cell-cycle arrest through downregulating c-Myc. Furthermore, disruption of c-Myc upon Brd4 inhibitor treatment led to G<sub>1</sub> cell-cycle arrest and overrode RET-driven cell proliferation. Moreover, consistent with the marked <i>in vivo</i> efficacy of RET inhibition, the intratumoral c-Myc level was significantly decreased. In summary, SYHA1815 is a promising RETi for RET-aberrant cancer treatment that is currently in a phase I trial.",2022,"Animals; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Down-Regulation; Female; Genes, myc; Humans; Mice; Mutation; Neoplasms; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret; Signal Transduction",52

Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify key genes and pathways involved in transformation of UL to ULMS through molecular differential analysis. Global gene expression profiles of 25 ULMS, 25 UL, and 29 myometrium (Myo) tissues generated on Affymetrix U133A 2.0 human genome microarrays were analyzed by deploying robust statistical, molecular interaction network, and pathway enrichment methods. The comparison of expression signals across Myo vs UL, Myo vs ULMS, and UL vs ULMS groups identified 249, 1037, and 716 significantly expressed genes, respectively (p&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.05).

The 716 DEGs between UL vs ULMS were found to affect cell cycle, cell division related Rho GTPases and PI3K signaling pathways triggering uncontrolled growth and metastasis of tumor cells (p value &#x2264; 0.01). Integration of gene networking data, with additional parameters like estimation of mutation burden of tumors and cancer driver gene identification, has led to the finding of 4 hubs (JUN, VCAN, TOP2A, and COL1A1) and 8 bottleneck genes (PIK3R1, MYH11, KDR, ESR1, WT1, CCND1, EZH2, and CDKN2A), which showed a clear distinction in their distribution pattern among leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas.

It is predominantly a disease of childhood; however, it can also occur in adults. Adult DMG has not been previously well described. The aim of this study was to define the characteristics of adult DMG. We described and analyzed the clinical, radiological, and genetic alterations of 9 adult DMGs and compared them with those of 257 non-midline adult high-grade IDH-WT gliomas.

By integrating MPE and PPE as malignant-associated pleural fluid (MAPF), the current study aimed to evaluate the effect of MAPF on cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of HUVEC. First, increased capillaries were identified in the subpleural layer of lung adenocarcinoma. Compatible with pathological observations, the ubiquitous elevation of HUVEC survival was identified in MAPF culture regardless of the underlying cancer type, the driver gene mutation, prior treatments and evidence of malignant cells in pleural fluid. Moreover, MAPF enhanced HUVEC motility with the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia and focal adhesion complex. Tube formation assay revealed angiogenic behavior with the observation of sheet-like structures. HUVEC cultured with MAPF resulted in a significant increase in MAPK phosphorylation. Accompanied with VEGFR2 upregulation in MAPF culture, there was increased expressions of p-STAT3, HIF-1&#x3b1; and Nf-kB. VEGF/VEGFR2 blockade regressed endothelial migration and angiogenesis but not cell proliferation.

On the one hand, these targets may be linked to unwanted side effects, but on the other, they may achieve a combined desired effect (polypharmacology) or represent multiple diseases (drug repositioning). With the growth of 3D structures of drug-target complexes, it is today possible to study drug promiscuity at the structural level and to screen vast amounts of drug-target interactions to predict side effects, polypharmacological potential, and repositioning opportunities. Here, we pursue such an approach to identify drugs inactivating B-cells, whose dysregulation can function as a driver of autoimmune diseases. Screening over 500 kinases, we identified 22 candidate targets, whose knock out impeded the activation of B-cells. Among these 22 is the gene KDR, whose gene product VEGFR2 is a prominent cancer target with anti-VEGFR2 drugs on the market for over a decade. The main result of this paper is that structure-based drug repositioning for the identified kinase targets identified the cancer drug ibrutinib as micromolar VEGFR2 inhibitor with a very high therapeutic index in B-cell inactivation. These findings prove that ibrutinib is not only acting on the Bruton's tyrosine kinase BTK, against which it was designed. Instead, it may be a polypharmacological drug, which additionally targets angiogenesis via inhibition of VEGFR2. Therefore ibrutinib carries potential to treat other VEGFR2 associated disease. Structure-based drug repositioning explains ibrutinib's anti VEGFR2 action through the conservation of a specific pattern of interactions of the drug with BTK and VEGFR2. Overall, structure-based drug repositioning was able to predict these findings at a fraction of the time and cost of a conventional screen.",2020,Adenine; Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase; B-Lymphocytes; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Jurkat Cells; Piperidines; Pyrazoles; Pyrimidines; RNA Interference; Signal Transduction; Suramin; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2,52

Mutations were also detected in KIT, PIK3CA, TP53, SMAD4, ATM, SMARCB1, PTEN, FLT3, GNAS, STK11, MET, CTNNB1, APC, FBXW7, ERBB4, and KDR (all &gt;10%). The status of EGFR and TP53 mutations was consistent between CSF ctDNA and brain lesion tissue in all five patients. Sequencing of CSF ctDNA revealed specific mutation patterns in driver genes among patients with NSCLC and brain metastasis. In some small-sample studies, the importance of cerebrospinal fluid in guiding the treatment of cancerous brain lesions has been verified in that it may reflect genomic mutations of brain tumors relatively accurately. Cerebrospinal fluid is a new form of liquid biopsy that can be helpful in improving the management of patients with brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer by detecting genetic abnormalities specific to brain metastases.",2021,"Brain; cerebrospinal fluid; circulating tumor DNA; metastasis; next-generation sequencing; Biomarkers, Tumor; Brain Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Circulating Tumor DNA; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplastic Cells, Circulating; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Tumor Cells, Cultured",52
31944535,KDR,10.1111/pcmr.12865,Distinct genomic traits of acral and mucosal melanomas revealed by targeted mutational profiling.,"The incidence of melanoma is rising globally including China. Comparing to Caucasians, the incidence of non-cutaneous melanomas is significantly higher in Chinese. Herein, we performed genomic profiling of 89 Chinese surgically resected primary melanomas, including acral (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;54), cutaneous (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;22), and mucosal (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;13), by hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing. We show that mucosal melanomas tended to harbor more pathogenic mutations than other types of melanoma, though the biological significance of this finding remains uncertain. Chromosomal arm-level alterations including 6q, 9p, and 10p/q loss were highly recurrent in all subtypes, but mucosal melanoma was significantly associated with increased genomic instability. Importantly, 7p gain significantly correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in non-cutaneous melanomas, representing an intriguing prognostic biomarker of those subtypes. Furthermore, focal amplification of 4q12 (KIT, KDR, and PDGFR&#x3b1;) and RAD51 deletion were more abundant in mucosal melanoma, while NOTCH2 amplification was enriched in acral melanoma. Additionally, cutaneous melanomas had higher mutation load than acral melanomas, while mucosal melanomas did not differ from other subtypes in mutation burden. Together, our data revealed important features of acral and mucosal melanomas in Chinese including distinctive driver mutation pattern and increased genomic instability. These findings highlight the possibilities of combination therapies in the clinical management of melanoma.",2021,"combination therapy; concurrent pathogenic mutation; copy number variations; genomic instability; melanoma; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asian People; DNA Mutational Analysis; Disease-Free Survival; Ethnicity; Female; Gene Dosage; Genomics; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Melanoma; Middle Aged; Mucous Membrane; Mutation; Young Adult",52

The World Health Organization classifies these tumors into three histopathological grades. Because of tumor recurrence, treating meningiomas may be challenging even in well-differentiated grade I (GI) neoplasms. Indeed, around 5% of completely resected GI meningiomas relapse within 5 years. Therefore, identifying driver mutations in GI meningiomas through next generation sequencing (NGS) assays is paramount. The aim of this study was to validate the use of the 50-gene AmpliSeq Hotspot Cancer Panel v2 to identify the mutational status of 23 GI meningioma, namely, 12 non recurrent and 11 recurrent. In 18 out of the 23 GI meningiomas analyzed, we identified at least one gene mutation (78.2%). The most frequently mutated genes were c-kit (39.1%), ATM (26.1%), TP53 (26.1%), EGFR (26.1%), STK11 (21.7%), NRAS (17.4%), SMAD4 (13%), FGFR3 (13%), and PTPN11 (13%); less frequent mutations were SMARCB1 (8.7%), FLT3 (8.7%), KRAS (8.7%), FBWX7 (8.7%), ABL1 (8.7%), ERBB2 (8.7%), IDH1 (8.7%), BRAF (8.7%), MET (8.7%), HRAS (4.3%), RB1 (4.3%), CTNNB1 (4.3%), PIK3CA (4.3%), VHL (4.3%), KDR (4.3%), APC (4.3%), NOTCH1 (4.3%), JAK3 (4.3%), and SRC (4.3%). To our knowledge, mutations in all of these genes, except for TP53, STK11, SMARCB1, PIK3CA, VHL, and BRAF, have never been described before in meningiomas. Hence, these findings demonstrate the viability of NGS to detect new genetic alterations in GI meningiomas. Equally important, this technology enabled us to detect possible novel actionable mutations not previously associated with GI and for which selective inhibitors already exist.",2021,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers, Tumor; DNA Mutational Analysis; Female; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Male; Meningeal Neoplasms; Meningioma; Middle Aged; Mutation; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Young Adult",52

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and/or RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed in 64 cases of DT to investigate the molecular profiles in combination with the clinicopathological characteristics. CTNNB1 mutations with specific hotspots were identified in 56 cases (87.5%). A copy number loss in chromosome 6 (chr6) was identified in 14 cases (21.9%). Clustering based on the mRNA expression profiles was predictive of the patients' prognoses. The risk score generated by the expression of a three-gene set (IFI6, LGMN, and CKLF) was a strong prognostic marker for recurrence-free survival (RFS) in our cohort. In risk groups stratified by the expression of IFI6, the hazard ratio for recurrence-free survival in the high-risk group relative to the low-risk group was 12.12 (95% confidence interval: 1.56-94.2; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;8.0&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;10<sup>6</sup>). In conclusion, CTNNB1 mutations and a chr6 copy number loss are likely the causative mutations underlying the tumorigenesis of DT while the gene expression profiles may help to differentiate patients who would be good candidates for wait-and-see management and those who might benefit from additional systemic or radiation therapies.",2021,"Desmoid tumours; Driver mutation; Molecular profiling; RNA-seq; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Chemokines; Child, Preschool; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6; Cysteine Endopeptidases; DNA Mutational Analysis; Female; Fibromatosis, Aggressive; Gene Dosage; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; MARVEL Domain-Containing Proteins; Male; Middle Aged; Mitochondrial Proteins; Mutation; Prognosis; RNA-Seq; Tokyo; Transcriptome; Exome Sequencing; Young Adult; beta Catenin",1

This study's objective was to characterise the mutational landscape of Indian prostate cancer using whole-exome sequencing to identify population-specific polymorphisms. Whole-exome sequencing was performed of 58 treatment-naive primary prostate tumors of Indian origin. Multiple computational and statistical analyses were used to profile the known common mutations, other deleterious mutations, driver genes, prognostic biomarkers, and gene signatures unique to each clinical parameter. Cox analysis was performed to validate survival-associated genes. McNemar test identified genes significant to recurrence and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to determine its accuracy. OncodriveCLUSTL algorithm was used to deduce driver genes. The druggable target identified was modeled with its known inhibitor using Autodock. TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene in our cohort. Three novel deleterious variants unique to the Indian prostate cancer subtype were identified: POLQ, FTHL17, and OR8G1. COX regression analysis identified ACSM5, a mitochondrial gene responsible for survival. CYLC1 gene, which encodes for sperm head cytoskeletal protein, was identified as an unfavorable prognostic biomarker indicative of recurrence. The novel POLQ mutant, also identified as a driver gene, was evaluated as the druggable target in this study. POLQ, a DNA repair enzyme implicated in various cancer types, is overexpressed and is associated with a poor prognosis. The mutant POLQ was subjected to structural analysis and modeled with its known inhibitor novobiocin resulting in decreased binding efficiency necessitating the development of a better drug. In this pilot study, the molecular profiling using multiple computational and statistical analyses revealed distinct polymorphisms in the Indian prostate cancer cohort. The mutational signatures identified provide a valuable resource for prognostic stratification and targeted treatment strategies for Indian prostate cancer patients. The DNA repair enzyme, POLQ, was identified as the druggable target in this study.",2023,Driver mutations; Indian prostate cancer; POLQ mutation; Targeted therapy; Whole-exome sequencing; Humans; Male; DNA Repair Enzymes; Exome Sequencing; Mutation; Pilot Projects; Prostatic Neoplasms; Semen; DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase,1

Cancer cell lines and animal models are indispensable for investigating the molecular mechanisms of organ specific tropism. However, till now, little is known about the drivers in HCC metastatic tropism, and also no effective way has been developed to block the process of tropistic metastasis. In this study, we established several monoclonal HCC cell lines from HCCLM3-RFP together with their xenograft models, and then analyzed their metastatic potentials and tropisms using in-vitro and in-vivo assays, and finally elucidated the driving forces of HCC tropistic metastases. Six monoclonal cell lines with different organ site-specific tropism were established successfully. SPARC, VCAM1 and ANGPTL4 were found positively correlated with the potentials of lung metastasis, while ITGA1 had a positive relation to lymph node metastasis of enterocoelia. By our powerful platforms, HCC metastatic tropisms in clinic could be easily mimicked and recapitulated for exploring the bilateral interactions between tumor and its microenvironment, elucidating the drivers of HCC metastatic tropisms, and testing anti-cancer effects of newly developed agent in pre-clinical stage.",2016,"Animals; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Clone Cells; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Profiling; Heterografts; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Neoplasm Metastasis",2

Identification of the ""driver"" gene(s) within cancer-derived amplicons is, however, hampered by the fact that most amplicons contain many gene products. Amplification of 1q21-1q23 is strongly associated with liposarcomas and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization narrowed down the likely candidate oncogenes to two: the activating transcription factor 6 (atf6) and the dual specificity phosphatase 12 (dusp12). While atf6 is an established transcriptional regulator of the unfolded protein response, the potential role of dusp12 in cancer remains uncharacterized. To evaluate the oncogenic potential of dusp12, we established stable cell lines that ectopically over-express dusp12 in isolation and determined whether this cell line acquired properties frequently associated with transformed cells. Here, we demonstrate that cells over-expressing dusp12 display increased cell motility and resistance to apoptosis. Additionally, over-expression of dusp12 promoted increased expression of the c-met proto-oncogene and the collagen and laminin receptor intergrin alpha 1 (itga1) which is implicated in metastasis. Collectively, these results suggest that dusp12 is oncologically relevant and exposes a potential association between dusp12 and established oncogenes that could be therapeutically targeted.",2011,"Apoptosis; Cell Line; Cell Movement; Dual-Specificity Phosphatases; Humans; Microscopy, Electron; Oncogenes; Proto-Oncogene Mas; RNA, Messenger",2

The acute phase reaction is cytokine-driven and includes a wide range of inflammatory mediators. This overall profile of the response depends on the inducing event and can also differ between patients. We investigated an extended acute phase cytokine profile for 97 renal cancer patients. Initial studies showed that the serum CRP levels had an expected prognostic association together with tumor size, stage, nuclear grading, and Leibovich score. Interleukin (IL)6 family cytokines, IL1 subfamily mediators, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)&#x3b1; can all be drivers of the acute phase response. Initial studies suggested that serum IL33R&#x3b1; (the soluble IL33 receptor &#x3b1; chain) levels were also associated with prognosis, although the impact of IL33R&#x3b1; is dependent on the overall cytokine profile, including seven IL6 family members (IL6, IL6R&#x3b1;, gp130, IL27, IL31, CNTF, and OSM), two IL1 subfamily members (IL1RA and IL33R&#x3b1;), and TNF&#x3b1;. We identified a patient subset characterized by particularly high levels of IL6, IL33R&#x3b1;, and TNF&#x3b1; alongside an adverse prognosis.

31472403,IL27,10.1016/j.cyto.2019.154817,Pancreatic cancer-associated inflammation drives dynamic regulation of p35 and Ebi3.,"B cells are important modulators of immune responses both in autoimmunity and cancer. We have previously shown that B regulatory (Breg) cells promote pancreatic cancer via production of IL35, a heterodimeric cytokine comprised of the subunits p35 (Il12a) and Ebi3. However, it is not known how production of IL35 is regulated in vivo in the context of cancer-associated inflammation. To begin addressing this question, we have generated a knock-in mouse model, Il12a<sup>GFP</sup>, where an IRES-emGFP gene was inserted within the 3' UTR of the Il12a locus. EmGFP signal in B cells from the Il12a<sup>GFP</sup> mice correlated with expression of p35 mRNA and protein. Using this model, we observed that in addition to Bregs, expression of GFP (p35) is upregulated in several other B cell subtypes in response to cancer. We assessed the expression of the other IL35 subunit, Ebi3, using a published tdTomato reporter model. We determined that Ebi3 expression was more tightly regulated in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that stimuli affecting Ebi3 upregulation are more likely to result in production of full IL35 heterodimer. We were also able to detect GFP and Tomato signal in myeloid &amp; T cell lineages suggesting that these reporter models could also be used for tracking IL12-, IL27- and IL35-producing cells. Furthermore, using primary B cells isolated from reporter mice, we identified BCR, CD40 and TLR pathways as potential drivers of IL35 expression. These findings highlight the importance of pancreatic cancer-associated inflammatory processes as drivers of cytokine expression and provide a tool to dissect both disease-associated regulation of IL12- and IL35-competent lineage cells as well as establish assays for pharmacological targeting of individual subunits of heterodimeric IL12 family cytokines.",2021,"IL35 cytokine; Pancreatic cancer; Regulatory B cell; Reporter model; Animals; B-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; CD40 Antigens; Cell Line, Tumor; Flow Cytometry; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Inflammation; Interleukin-12 Subunit p35; Interleukins; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Minor Histocompatibility Antigens; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr; Receptors, Cytokine; Toll-Like Receptors; Up-Regulation",4

Dysregulated expression of co-inhibitory receptors on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells promotes autoimmunity, whereas sustained overexpression on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells promotes T cell dysfunction or exhaustion, leading to impaired ability to clear chronic viral infections and diseases such as cancer<sup>1,2</sup>. Here, using RNA and protein expression profiling at single-cell resolution in mouse cells, we identify a module of co-inhibitory receptors that includes not only several known co-inhibitory receptors (PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3 and TIGIT) but also many new surface receptors. We functionally validated two new co-inhibitory receptors, activated protein C receptor (PROCR) and podoplanin (PDPN). The module of co-inhibitory receptors is co-expressed in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and is part of a larger co-inhibitory gene program that is shared by non-responsive T cells in several physiological contexts and is driven by the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-27. Computational analysis identified the transcription factors PRDM1 and c-MAF as cooperative regulators of the co-inhibitory module, and this was validated experimentally.

Autocrine and microenvironmental signals dictate PCSLC behavior and patient outcome. In prostate cancer patients, IL30/IL27p28 has been linked with tumor progression, but the mechanisms underlying this link remain mostly elusive. Here, we asked whether IL30 may favor prostate cancer progression by conditioning PCSLCs and assessed the value of blocking IL30 to suppress tumor growth. IL30 was produced by PCSLCs in human and murine prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and displayed significant autocrine and paracrine effects. PCSLC-derived IL30 supported PCSLC viability, self-renewal and tumorigenicity, expression of inflammatory mediators and growth factors, tumor immune evasion, and regulated chemokine and chemokine receptor genes, primarily via STAT1/STAT3 signaling. IL30 overproduction by PCSLCs promoted tumor onset and development associated with increased proliferation, vascularization, and myeloid cell recruitment. Furthermore, it promoted PCSLC dissemination to lymph nodes and bone marrow by upregulating the CXCR5/CXCL13 axis, and drove metastasis to lungs through the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis. These mechanisms were drastically hindered by IL30 knockdown or knockout in PCSLCs. Collectively, these results mark IL30 as a key driver of PCSLC behavior. Targeting IL30 signaling may be a potential therapeutic strategy against prostate cancer progression and recurrence.<b>Significance:</b> IL30 plays an important role in regulating prostate cancer stem-like cell behavior and metastatic potential, therefore targeting this cytokine could hamper prostate cancer progression or recurrence. <i>Cancer Res; 78(10); 2654-68. &#xa9;2018 AACR</i>.",2019,"Animals; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Chemokine CXCL13; Interleukins; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Prostate; Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia; Prostatic Neoplasms; Receptors, CXCR5; STAT1 Transcription Factor; STAT3 Transcription Factor",4

CRC tumorigenesis is also driven by multiple epi-mutational modifiers, such as transcriptional regulators. We describe the common (and near-universal) activation of the zinc finger transcription factor and Let-7 target PLAGL2 in CRC and find that it is a key driver of intestinal epithelial transformation. PLAGL2 drives proliferation, cell cycle progression, and anchorage-independent growth in CRC cell lines and non-transformed intestinal cells. Investigating effects of PLAGL2 on downstream pathways revealed very modest effects on canonical Wnt signaling. Alternatively, we find pronounced effects on the direct PLAGL2 target genes IGF2, a fetal growth factor, and ASCL2, an intestinal stem cell-specific bHLH transcription factor. Inactivation of PLAGL2 in CRC cell lines has pronounced effects on ASCL2 reporter activity. Furthermore, ASCL2 expression can partially rescue deficits of proliferation and cell cycle progression caused by depletion of PLAGL2 in CRC cell lines. Thus, the oncogenic effects of PLAGL2 appear to be mediated via core stem cell and onco-fetal pathways, with minimal effects on downstream Wnt signaling.",2023,Colorectal Cancer; IGF2; PLAGL2; Tumorigenesis; Wnt,16

Parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHLH) is potentially a critical factor in cancer-associated cachexia. We previously showed that streptonigrin - an aminoquinone with antitumor effects - inhibited the interaction between TCF4 and TWIST1. This study aimed to determine the anti-cachectic performance of streptonigrin in lung cancer. We assessed the effect of streptonigrin on the interaction of TCF4 and TWIST1 using co-immunoprecipitation and a mammalian-two hybrid luciferase assay, which was confirmed by an in vitro GST pull-down assay using recombinant bHLH domain-containing TCF4 and TWIST1. We assessed the anti-cachectic effect of streptonigrin in vivo using an LLC1 cell-induced tumour-bearing mouse model. Changes in the degree of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue wasting were determined by measuring the weights of gastrocnemius and epidydimal white adipose tissue. Streptonigrin was found to inhibit the interaction of TCF4 with TWIST1 in a dose-dependent manner. The in vitro GST pull-down assay revealed that streptonigrin directly inhibited the interaction between TCF4 and TWIST1. The expression of PTHLH mRNA, which is transcriptionally regulated by the TCF4/TWIST1 complex in response to TGF-&#x3b2;1 signalling, was decreased in streptonigrin-treated lung cancer cells. Streptonigrin significantly decreased the expression of proteolysis-related genes in skeletal muscle and browning-related genes in white adipose tissues of LLC1-induced tumour-bearing mice.

In this report, we provide evidence that OBD9 suppresses colorectal cancer growth by interfering with the Wnt signaling pathway, a main driver of cell growth in colorectal cancer. Specifically, we find that OBD9 induces autophagic degradation of TNIK (traf2 and Nck-interacting kinase), which promotes T-cell factor-4 (TCF4)/beta-catenin-mediated gene expression. Thus, OBD9 as a TNIK inhibitor blocks Wnt/beta-catenin signaling at the final step of transcriptional activation.

The development of FLC is associated with creation of a fusion oncoprotein DNAJB1-PKAc kinase, which activates multiple cancer-associated pathways. The aim of this study was to examine the role of human genomic regions, called cancer-enhancing genomic regions or aggressive liver cancer domains (CEGRs/ALCDs), in the development of FLC. Previous studies revealed that CEGRs/ALCDs are located in multiple oncogenes and cancer-associated genes, regularly silenced in normal tissues. Using the regulatory element locus intersection (RELI) algorithm, we searched a large compendium of chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP) data sets and found that CEGRs/ALCDs contain regulatory elements in several human cancers outside of pediatric hepatic neoplasms. The RELI algorithm further identified components of the &#x3b2;-catenin-TCF7L2/TCF4 pathway, which interacts with CEGRs/ALCDs in several human cancers. Particularly, the RELI algorithm found interactions of transcription factors and chromatin remodelers with many genes that are activated in patients with FLC. We found that these FLC-specific genes contain CEGRs/ALCDs, and that the driver of FLC, fusion oncoprotein DNAJB1-PKAc, phosphorylates &#x3b2;-catenin at Ser675, resulting in an increase of &#x3b2;-catenin-TCF7L2/TCF4 complexes. These complexes increase a large family of CEGR/ALCD-dependent collagens and oncogenes. The DNAJB1-PKAc-&#x3b2;-catenin-CEGR/ALCD pathway is preserved in lung metastasis. The inhibition of &#x3b2;-catenin in FLC organoids inhibited the expression of CEGRs/ALCDs-dependent collagens and oncogenes, preventing the formation of the organoid's structure. Conclusion: This study provides a rationale for the development of &#x3b2;-catenin-based therapy for patients with FLC.",2022,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Chromatin; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genome, Human; Genomics; HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Transcription Factors; beta Catenin",16

Mechanistically, TRAF2 positively regulates Wnt signaling by interacting with the N-terminal of &#x3b2;-catenin via its TRAF-C domain; this interaction is disrupted in presence of LDA. Particularly, a TRAF2/&#x3b2;-catenin/TCF4/TNIK complex is present in colon cancer cells, where TRAF2 is indispensable for the complex formation, and TRAF2/&#x3b2;-catenin and &#x3b2;-catenin/TCF4 interactions are disrupted upon LDA treatment.

The signature driver of canonical Wnt pathway, &#x3b2;-catenin, and its co-activator RNA helicase p68, are also overexpressed in colorectal carcinoma. In this study, we describe a novel mechanism of Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin and p68 mediated transcriptional activation of CHIP gene leading to enhanced proliferation of colorectal carcinoma cells. Bioinformatic analyses reconfirmed an elevated CHIP expression level in colorectal carcinoma datasets. Wnt3A treatment and pharmacological activation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway resulted in increased nuclear translocation of &#x3b2;-catenin, augmenting CHIP expression. Likewise, immunoblotting and Real time PCR following overexpression and knockdown of &#x3b2;-catenin and p68 demonstrated upregulated and downregulated CHIP expression, respectively, at both mRNA and protein levels. p68 along with &#x3b2;-catenin were found to occupy Transcription Factor 4 (TCF4) binding sites on endogenous CHIP promoter and regulate its transcription. After cloning CHIP promoter, the increased and decreased promoter activities of CHIP induced by overexpression and knockdown of either &#x3b2;-catenin or p68 further confirmed transcriptional regulation of CHIP gene by Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin signaling cascade. Finally, enhanced cellular propagation and migration of colorectal carcinoma cells induced by 'Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin-p68-CHIP' axis established the significance of this pathway in oncogenesis.

33080033,TCF4,10.1093/nar/gkaa901,EWS-FLI1 regulates and cooperates with core regulatory circuitry in Ewing sarcoma.,"Core regulatory circuitry (CRC)-dependent transcriptional network is critical for developmental tumors in children and adolescents carrying few gene mutations. However, whether and how CRC contributes to transcription regulation in Ewing sarcoma is unknown. Here, we identify and functionally validate a CRC 'trio' constituted by three transcription factors (TFs): KLF15, TCF4 and NKX2-2, in Ewing sarcoma cells. Epigenomic analyses demonstrate that EWS-FLI1, the primary fusion driver for this cancer, directly establishes super-enhancers of each of these three TFs to activate their transcription. In turn, KLF15, TCF4 and NKX2-2 co-bind to their own and each other's super-enhancers and promoters, forming an inter-connected auto-regulatory loop. Functionally, CRC factors contribute significantly to cell proliferation of Ewing sarcoma both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CRC factors exhibit prominent capacity of co-regulating the epigenome in cooperation with EWS-FLI1, occupying 77.2% of promoters and 55.6% of enhancers genome-wide. Downstream, CRC TFs coordinately regulate gene expression networks in Ewing sarcoma, controlling important signaling pathways for cancer, such as lipid metabolism pathway, PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. Together, molecular characterization of the oncogenic CRC model advances our understanding of the biology of Ewing sarcoma. Moreover, CRC-downstream genes and signaling pathways may contain potential therapeutic targets for this malignancy.",2021,"Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Regulatory Networks; Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.2; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors; Lipid Metabolism; Mice, Nude; Nuclear Proteins; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1; RNA-Binding Protein EWS; Sarcoma, Ewing; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factor 4; Transcription Factors; Zebrafish Proteins",16

However, non-coding cancer driver mutations are less well-characterized and only a handful of recurrent non-coding mutations, most notably TERT promoter mutations, have been reported. Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, which aggregated whole genome sequencing data from 2658 cancer across 38 tumor types, we perform multi-faceted pathway and network analyses of non-coding mutations across 2583 whole cancer genomes from 27 tumor types compiled by the ICGC/TCGA PCAWG project that was motivated by the success of pathway and network analyses in prioritizing rare mutations in protein-coding genes. While few non-coding genomic elements are recurrently mutated in this cohort, we identify 93 genes harboring non-coding mutations that cluster into several modules of interacting proteins. Among these are promoter mutations associated with reduced mRNA expression in TP53, TLE4, and TCF4. We find that biological processes had variable proportions of coding and non-coding mutations, with chromatin remodeling and proliferation pathways altered primarily by coding mutations, while developmental pathways, including Wnt and Notch, altered by both coding and non-coding mutations. RNA splicing is primarily altered by non-coding mutations in this cohort, and samples containing non-coding mutations in well-known RNA splicing factors exhibit similar gene expression signatures as samples with coding mutations in these genes. These analyses contribute a new repertoire of possible cancer genes and mechanisms that are altered by non-coding mutations and offer insights into additional cancer vulnerabilities that can be investigated for potential therapeutic treatments.",2020,"Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genome, Human; Humans; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Mutation; Neoplasms; Promoter Regions, Genetic; RNA Splicing",16

In this study, we comprehensively delineated the genomic basis of BL through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 101 tumors representing all 3 subtypes of BL to identify 72 driver genes. These data were additionally informed by CRISPR screens in BL cell lines to functionally annotate the role of oncogenic drivers. Nearly every driver gene was found to have both coding and non-coding mutations, highlighting the importance of WGS for identifying driver events. Our data implicate coding and non-coding mutations in IGLL5, BACH2, SIN3A, and DNMT1. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was associated with higher mutation load, with type 1 EBV showing a higher mutational burden than type 2 EBV. Although sporadic and immunodeficiency-associated BLs had similar genetic profiles, endemic BLs manifested more frequent mutations in BCL7A and BCL6 and fewer genetic alterations in DNMT1, SNTB2, and CTCF. Silencing mutations in ID3 were a common feature of all 3 subtypes of BL. In vitro, mass spectrometry-based proteomics demonstrated that the ID3 protein binds primarily to TCF3 and TCF4. In vivo knockout of ID3 potentiated the effects of MYC, leading to rapid tumorigenesis and tumor phenotypes consistent with those observed in the human disease.",2020,Animals; Burkitt Lymphoma; Humans; Mice; Whole Genome Sequencing,16

HBP1 activates or represses the expression of different cell cycle genes (such as CDKN2A, CDKN1A, and CCND1) through direct DNA binding, cofactor recruitment, chromatin remodeling, or neutralization of other transcription factors. Among these are LEF1, TCF4, and MYC in the WNT/beta-catenin pathway. HBP1 also contributes to oncogenic RAS-induced senescence and terminal cell differentiation. Collectively, these activities suggest a tumor suppressor function. However, HBP1 is not listed among frequently mutated cancer driver genes. Nevertheless, HBP1 expression is lower in several tumor types relative to matched normal tissues. Several micro-RNAs, such as miR-155, miR-17-92, and miR-29a, dampen HBP1 expression in cancer cells of various origins. The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway also inhibits HBP1 transcription by preventing FOXO binding to the HBP1 promoter. In addition, AKT directly phosphorylates HBP1, thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity. Taken together, these findings place HBP1 at the center of a network of micro-RNAs and oncoproteins that control cell proliferation.

In this study, we demonstrate a critical role of &#x3b2;-catenin signaling in stabilization of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and control of EZH2-mediated gene repression in oncogenesis. &#x3b2;-Catenin/TCF4 activated the transcription of the deubiquitinase USP1, which then interacted with and deubiquitinated EZH2 directly. USP1-mediated stabilization of EZH2 promoted its recruitment to the promoters of CDKN1B, RUNX3, and HOXA5, resulting in enhanced enrichment of histone H3K27me3 and repression of target gene expression. In human glioma specimens, expression levels of nuclear &#x3b2;-catenin, USP1, and EZH2 correlated with one another. Depletion of &#x3b2;-catenin/USP1/EZH2 repressed glioma cell proliferation <i>in vitro</i> and tumor formation <i>in vivo</i>. Our findings indicate that a &#x3b2;-catenin-USP1-EZH2 axis orchestrates the interplay between dysregulated &#x3b2;-catenin signaling and EZH2-mediated gene epigenetic silencing during glioma tumorigenesis.

It is involved in many physiological processes, as well as in cancer. This study addresses mechanisms of crosstalk between EMN-driven cancer-related cellular responses and the canonical Wnt-pathway in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. Genetic knockdown of EMN in MCF-7 resulted in characteristic changes in cellular shape, organization of the actin cytoskeleton and malignancy profile, indicating that EMN expression represses cell motility, but, in contrast, exerts a stimulatory effect on cell proliferation and invasive properties. Increased invasiveness coincided with elevated expression of Wnt-target genes and established invasion driver matrix metalloproteinase MMP14. Activation of the downstream Wnt-pathway by means of heterologous &#x3b2;-catenin and/or TCF-4 expression, through inhibition of GSK-3&#x3b2; by LiCl treatment, or by cell stimulation with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) resulted in increased EMN expression. EMN over-expression raised the ratio of the two opposing Wnt pathway-driven transcription factors Sp1 and Sp5, leading to stimulation of the EMN promoter. Furthermore, the EMN promoter was activated by a feed-forward circuit involving an EMN-dependent drop in expression of the repressive signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Taken together, we show that the influence of EMMPRIN on malignancy-related properties of breast cancer cells is functionally connected to both Wnt- and JAK/STAT pathways.",2019,"Breast cancer; EMN; Feed-forward regulation; STAT1; Sp5; Wnt pathway; Apoptosis; Basigin; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Female; Humans; Janus Kinase 1; Neoplasm Invasiveness; STAT1 Transcription Factor; Signal Transduction; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Wnt1 Protein",16

We sought to define the repertoire of genetic alterations in breast cancer patients with <i>de novo</i> metastatic disease who had not received local or systemic therapy.<b>Experimental Design:</b> Up to two anatomically distinct core biopsies of primary breast cancers and synchronous distant metastases from nine patients who presented with metastatic disease were subjected to high-depth whole-exome sequencing. Mutations, copy number alterations and their cancer cell fractions, and mutation signatures were defined using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods. All mutations identified were validated with orthogonal methods.<b>Results:</b> Genomic differences were observed between primary and metastatic deposits, with a median of 60% (range 6%-95%) of shared somatic mutations. Although mutations in known driver genes including <i>TP53, PIK3CA</i>, and <i>GATA3</i> were preferentially clonal in both sites, primary breast cancers and their synchronous metastases displayed spatial intratumor heterogeneity. Likely pathogenic mutations affecting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-related genes, including <i>SMAD4, TCF7L2</i>, and <i>TCF4</i> (<i>ITF2</i>), were found to be restricted to or enriched in the metastatic lesions. Mutational signatures of trunk mutations differed from those of mutations enriched in the primary tumor or the metastasis in six cases.<b>Conclusions:</b> Synchronous primary breast cancers and metastases differ in their repertoire of somatic genetic alterations even in the absence of systemic therapy. Mutational signature shifts might contribute to spatial intratumor genetic heterogeneity. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(15); 4402-15. &#xa9;2017 AACR</i>.",2018,Adult; Bone Neoplasms; Breast Neoplasms; Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Clonal Evolution; DNA Copy Number Variations; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Exome; Female; GATA3 Transcription Factor; Genetic Heterogeneity; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Mutation; Neoplasm Metastasis; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53,16

Dysregulation of cell signaling pathways is a common denominator in tumorigenesis, including hepatocarcinogenesis. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling system is commonly activated in HCC, and is currently being evaluated as a therapeutic target in combination therapies. We and others have identified a central role for the EGFR ligand amphiregulin (AR) in the proliferation, survival and drug resistance of HCC cells. AR expression is frequently up-regulated in HCC tissues and cells through mechanisms not completely known. Here we identify the &#x3b2;-catenin signaling pathway as a novel mechanism leading to transcriptional activation of the AR gene in human HCC cells. Activation of &#x3b2;-catenin signaling, or expression of the T41A &#x3b2;-catenin active mutant, led to the induction of AR expression involving three specific &#x3b2;-catenin-Tcf responsive elements in its proximal promoter. We demonstrate that HCC cells expressing the T41A &#x3b2;-catenin active mutant show enhanced proliferation that is dependent in part on AR expression and EGFR signaling. We also demonstrate here a novel cross-talk of the EGFR system with fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19). FGF19 is a recently identified driver gene in hepatocarcinogenesis and an activator of &#x3b2;-catenin signaling in HCC and colon cancer cells. We show that FGF19 induced AR gene expression through the &#x3b2;-catenin pathway in human HCC cells. Importantly, AR up-regulation and EGFR signaling participated in the induction of cyclin D1 and cell proliferation elicited by FGF19. Finally, we demonstrate a positive correlation between FGF19 and AR expression in human HCC tissues, therefore supporting in clinical samples our experimental observations. These findings identify the AR/EGFR system as a key mediator of FGF19 responses in HCC cells involving &#x3b2;-catenin signaling, and suggest that combined targeting of FGF19 and AR/EGFR may enhance therapeutic efficacy.",2013,"Amphiregulin; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cyclin D1; EGF Family of Proteins; ErbB Receptors; Fibroblast Growth Factors; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glycoproteins; Humans; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Liver Neoplasms; Mutation; Prognosis; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factor 4; Transcription Factors; beta Catenin",16

The follow-up of PTC patients is based on the monitoring of serum thyroglobulin levels which is regulated by the thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1): a tissue-specific transcription factor essential for the differentiation of the thyroid. We investigated whether the Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin pathway might regulate TTF-1 expression in a human PTC model and examined the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation. Immunofluorescence analysis, real time RT-PCR and Western blot studies revealed that TTF-1 as well as the major Wnt pathway components are co-expressed in TPC-1 cells and human PTC tumours. Knocking-down the Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin components by siRNAs inhibited both TTF-1 transcript and protein expression, while mimicking the activation of Wnt signaling by lithium chloride induced TTF-1 gene and protein expression. Functional promoter studies and ChIP analysis showed that the Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin pathway exerts its effect by means of the binding of &#x3b2;-catenin to TCF/LEF transcription factors on the level of an active TCF/LEF response element at [-798, -792 bp] in TTF-1 promoter. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin pathway is a direct and forward driver of the TTF-1 expression.

The Cre-Lox system consists of methodology for enhancing targeted expression from tissue-specific or cancer-specific promoters. We analyzed the efficiency of Wnt-specific promoters as drivers of the Cre-mediated activity of a luciferase reporter gene or cell death effector gene in CRC cell lines in the presence and absence of two modulators of Wnt activity, sodium butyrate and lithium chloride. Butyrate is present in the colonic lumen after digestion of fiber-rich foods, whereas the colonic lumen is readily accessible to lithium chloride. In both SW620 and HCT-116 CRC cells, a physiologically relevant concentration of butyrate upregulated reporter and effector activity and altered the Wnt-specific expression pattern. Lithium chloride markedly enhanced Cre-Lox-mediated Wnt-specific reporter expression only in APC wild-type CRC cells. Possibilities for genetic modulation of the proposed CRC therapy included Wnt-specific expression of a floxed Lef1-VP16 fusion that enhanced Wnt-specific cell death and of a floxed dominant-negative Tcf4 that specifically downregulated endogenous Wnt activity. These findings demonstrated that the Cre-Lox system, in combination with pharmacological and genetic modulators, represents effective methodology for enhancing Wnt-targeted gene therapy.",2004,"Apoptosis; Butyrates; Cell Line, Tumor; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cytomegalovirus; DNA-Binding Proteins; Diphtheria Toxin; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Reporter; Genetic Therapy; Genetic Vectors; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65; Humans; Integrases; Isobutyrates; Lithium Chloride; Luciferases; Luminescent Proteins; Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1; Peptide Fragments; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Transcription Factors; Viral Proteins; Wnt Proteins; Zebrafish Proteins",16

To fill this gap, we collected various B-cell fractions from bone marrow (BM) and tonsil donors, performed RNA sequencing, and examined transcript variants. We identified 150 genes that harbor local splicing variations in all pairwise comparisons. One of them encodes FBXW7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated as a driver in several blood cancers. Surprisingly, we discovered that in normal human pro-B cells, the predominant transcript used an alternative first exon to produce the poorly characterized FBXW7&#x3b2; isoform, previously thought to be restricted to neural tissues. The FBXW7&#x3b2; transcript was also abundant in cell lines and primary samples of pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), which originates in the BM. When overexpressed in a heterologous cell system, this transcript yielded the expected protein product, as judged by anti-FLAG immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. Furthermore, in REH B-ALL cells, FBXW7&#x3b2; mRNA was the only FBXW7 isoform enriched in the polyribosome fraction. To shed light on possible functions of&#xa0;FBXW7&#x3b2;, we used gain- and loss-of-function approaches and identified an FBXW7-dependent inflammatory gene signature, apparent in a subset of B-ALL with high FBXW7&#x3b2; expression. This signature contained several members of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, including those comprising the HLA Class III cluster (LTB, LST1, NCR3, LTA, and NFKBIL1).

Knowledge on underlying oncogenic mechanisms remains scarce. Here, we analysed and compared the mutational landscape of RCDII and EATL in order to identify genetic drivers of CeD-associated lymphomagenesis. Pure populations of RCDII-cells derived from intestinal biopsies (n=9) or sorted from blood (n=2) were analysed by whole exome sequencing, comparative genomic hybridisation and RNA sequencing. Biopsies from RCDII (n=50), EATL (n=19), type I refractory CeD (n=7) and uncomplicated CeD (n=18) were analysed by targeted next-generation sequencing. Moreover, functional in vitro studies and drug testing were performed in RCDII-derived cell lines. 80% of RCDII and 90% of EATL displayed somatic gain-of-functions mutations in the JAK1-STAT3 pathway, including a remarkable p.G1097 hotspot mutation in the JAK1 kinase domain in approximately 50% of cases. Other recurrent somatic events were deleterious mutations in nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-&#x3ba;B) regulators TNFAIP3 and TNIP3 and potentially oncogenic mutations in TET2, KMT2D and DDX3X. JAK1 inhibitors, and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib could block survival and proliferation of malignant RCDII-cell lines. Mutations activating the JAK1-STAT3 pathway appear to be the main drivers of CeD-associated lymphomagenesis.

Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) is an important mutagenic driver that has seldom been investigated in PDAC. Therefore, this study investigated the significance of APOBEC3C in PDAC. First, cytosine deamination-associated mutation signatures were identified in the PDAC cohorts from TCGA and Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) datasets, and C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;X-enriched kataegis regions were identified in the FUSCC cohort (12 to 27 counts per sample). Patients were stratified according to APOBEC3C expression, and high APOBEC3C expression was found to correlate with a higher motif enrichment score of 5'-CC-3' and an elevated kataegis count within PCSK5 and NES genes. Second, we compared APOBEC expression in PDAC and normal pancreatic tissues and found that APOBEC3C was substantially upregulated in PDAC. APOBEC3C-overexpressing cell lines were generated to substantiate the effects of APOBEC3C on PDAC genome, including alterations in single-nucleotide variant (SNV) classes (higher proportion of C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T conversions) and the formation of kataegis regions (newly occurring kataegis regions detected in ACHE and MUC6 genes). Three different PDAC cohorts (FUSCC, TCGA, and QCMG) were analysed to evaluate the prognostic value of APOBEC3C, and APOBEC3C overexpression predicted shorter survival. Finally, the APOBEC3C overexpression correalted with the PDAC tumour microenvironment (TME) remodelling, APOBEC3C expression was associated with the invasion of CD4&#x2009;+&#x2009;T lymphocytes and CD8&#x2009;+&#x2009;T lymphocytes (cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CTLs), indicating enhanced immune activity and validating the practicality of APOBEC3C for guiding immunotherapy.",2022,NA,2

However, comprehensive analysis of AS and its clinical significance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) is urgently required. <b>Methods:</b> Genome-wide profiling of AS events using RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program was performed in a cohort of 464 patients with HNSC. Cancer-associated AS events (CASEs) were identified between paired HNSC and adjacent normal tissues and evaluated in functional enrichment analysis. Splicing networks and prognostic models were constructed using bioinformatics tools. Unsupervised clustering of the CASEs identified was conducted and associations with clinical, molecular and immune features were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> We detected a total of 32,309 AS events and identified 473 CASEs in HNSC; among these, 91 were validated in an independent cohort (n = 15). Functional protein domains were frequently altered, especially by CASEs affecting cancer drivers, such as PCSK5. CASE parent genes were significantly enriched in pathways related to HNSC and the tumor immune microenvironment, such as the viral carcinogenesis (FDR &lt; 0.001), Human Papillomavirus infection (FDR &lt; 0.001), chemokine (FDR &lt; 0.001) and T cell receptor (FDR&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.001) signaling pathways. CASEs enriched in immune-related pathways were closely associated with immune cell infiltration and cytolytic activity. AS regulatory networks suggested a significant association between splicing factor (SF) expression and CASEs and might be regulated by SF methylation. Eighteen CASEs were identified as independent prognostic factors for overall and disease-free survival. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed distinct correlations between AS-based clusters and prognosis, molecular characteristics and immune features. Immunogenic features and immune subgroups cooperatively depict the immune features of AS-based clusters. <b>Conclusion:</b> This comprehensive genome-wide analysis of the AS landscape in HNSC revealed novel AS events related to carcinogenesis and immune microenvironment, with implications for prognosis and therapeutic responses.",2020,"alternative splicing; genome-wide analysis; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; immune microenvironment.; tumorigenesis; Alternative Splicing; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinogenesis; Cohort Studies; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Papillomavirus Infections; Prognosis; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; Tumor Microenvironment",2

In these tumors, NSD1 inactivation is a driver of T cell exclusion from the tumor microenvironment (TME). A better understanding of the NSD1-mediated mechanism regulating infiltration of T cells into the TME could help identify approaches to overcome immununosuppression. Here, we demonstrated that NSD1 inactivation results in lower levels of H3K36 di-methylation and higher levels of H3K27 tri-methylation, the latter being a known repressive histone mark enriched on the promoters of key T cell chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10. HNSCC with NSD1 mutations had lower levels of these chemokines and lacked responses to PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. Inhibition of KDM2A, the primary lysine demethylase that is selective for H3K36, reversed the altered histone marks induced by NSD1 loss and restored T cell infiltration into the TME. Importantly, KDM2A suppression decreased growth of NSD1-deficient tumors in immunocompetent, but not in immunodeficient, mice. Together, these data indicate that KDM2A is an immunotherapeutic target for overcoming immune exclusion in HNSCC.",2023,NA,22

Unlike other HIV-associated cancers, the risk of cervical cancer development does not change when HPV/HIV coinfected women begin antiretroviral therapy, suggesting HIV-associated immune suppression is not a key driver of cervical cancer development in coinfected women. Here, we investigated whether the persistent secretion of inflammatory factors in HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy could enhance cancer signaling in HPV-infected cervical cells <i>via</i> endocrine mechanisms. We integrated previously reported HIV-induced secreted inflammatory factors (Hi-SIFs), HIV and HPV virus-human protein interactions, and cervical cancer patient genomic data using network propagation to understand the pathways underlying disease development in HPV/HIV coinfection. Our results pinpointed the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway to be enriched at the interface between Hi-SIFs and HPV-host molecular networks, in alignment with PI3K pathway mutations being prominent drivers of HPV-associated, but HIV independent, cervical cancer development. Furthermore, we experimentally stimulated cervical cells with 14 Hi-SIFs to assess their ability to activate PI3K-AKT signaling. Strikingly, we found 8 factors (CD14, CXCL11, CXCL9, CXCL13, CXCL17, AHSG, CCL18, and MMP-1) to significantly upregulate AKT phosphorylation (pAKT-S473) relative to a phosphate buffered saline control. Our findings suggest that Hi-SIFs cooperate with HPV infection in cervical cells to over-activate PI3K-AKT signaling, effectively phenocopying PI3K-AKT pathway mutations, resulting in enhanced cervical cancer development in coinfected women. Our insights could support the design of therapeutic interventions targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway or neutralizing Hi-SIFs in HPV/HIV coinfected cervical cancer patients.",2023,NA,22
36356191,CXCL9,10.1111/bph.15984,Characterization of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced cardiotoxicity reveals interleukin-17A as a driver of cardiac dysfunction after anti-PD-1 treatment.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, have revolutionized cancer therapy by enhancing the cytotoxic effects of T-cells against tumours. However, enhanced T-cell activity also may cause myocarditis and cardiotoxicity. Our understanding of the mechanisms of ICI-induced cardiotoxicity is limited. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of PD-1 inhibition on cardiac function and explore the molecular mechanisms of ICI-induced cardiotoxicity. C57BL6/J and BALB/c mice were treated with isotype control or anti-PD-1 antibody. Echocardiography was used to assess cardiac function. Cardiac transcriptomic changes were investigated by bulk RNA sequencing. Inflammatory changes were assessed by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in heart, thymus, and spleen of the animals. In follow-up experiments, anti-CD4 and anti-IL-17A antibodies were used along with PD-1 blockade in C57BL/6J mice. Anti-PD-1 treatment led to cardiac dysfunction and left ventricular dilation in C57BL/6J mice, with increased nitrosative stress. Only mild inflammation was observed in the heart. However, PD-1 inhibition resulted in enhanced thymic inflammatory signalling, where Il17a increased most prominently. In BALB/c mice, cardiac dysfunction was not evident, and thymic inflammatory activation was more balanced. Inhibition of IL-17A prevented anti-PD-1-induced cardiac dysfunction in C57BL6/J mice. Comparing myocardial transcriptomic changes in C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice, differentially regulated genes (Dmd, Ass1, Chrm2, Nfkbia, Stat3, Gsk3b, Cxcl9, Fxyd2, and Ldb3) were revealed, related to cardiac structure, signalling, and inflammation. PD-1 blockade induces cardiac dysfunction in mice with increased IL-17 signalling in the thymus.

The chemokines and their receptors influence migration and functions of both tumor and immune cells. Also, molecular characteristics are associated with the efficacy of melanoma therapy. However, there lacked exploration of immune characteristics and the association with molecular characteristics. We collected the currently available 569 melanoma samples that had both the genomic and transcriptional data from TCGA and SRA databases. We first identified TME subtypes based on the developed immune signatures, and then divided the samples into two immune cohorts based on the immune score. Next, we estimated the compositions of the immune cells of the two cohorts, and performed differential expression genes (DEGs) and functional enrichments. In addition, we investigated the interactions of chemokines and their receptors under immune cells. Finally, we explored the genomic characteristics under different immune subtypes. TME type D had a better prognosis among the four subtypes. The high-immunity cohort had significantly high 16 immune cells. The 63 upregulated and 384 downregulated genes in the high-immunity cohort were enriched in immune-related biological processes, and keratin, pigmentation and epithelial cells, respectively. The correlations of chemokines and their receptors with immune cell infiltration, such as CCR5-CCL4/CCL5 and CXCR3-CXCL9/CXCL10/CXCL11/CXCL13 axis, showed that the recruitments of 11 immune cells, such as CD4T cells and CD8T cells, were modulated by chemokines and their receptors. The proportions of the four TME subtypes in each molecular subtype were comparable. The two driver genes, CDKN2A and PRB2, had significantly different MAFs between the high-immunity and low-immunity. We dissected the characteristics of immune infiltration, the interactions of chemokines and their receptors under immune cells, and the correlation of molecular and immune characteristics. Our work will enable the reasonable selection of anti-melanoma treatments and accelerate the development of new therapeutic strategies for melanoma.",2022,chemokines and their receptors; melanoma; molecular characteristics; survival outcome; tumor microenvironment,22

Germline and somatic whole-exome DNA and RNA sequencing, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) IHC, and stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte scoring were performed on 57 patients. We validated our results using 162 patients from the GeparNuevo randomized trial. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that pathways involved in immunity (adaptive, humoral, innate), JAK-STAT signaling, cancer drivers, cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair were enriched in cases with pathologic complete response (pCR), whereas epithelial-mesenchymal transition, extracellular matrix, and TGF&#x3b2; pathways were enriched in cases with residual disease (RD). Immune-rich bTNBC with RD was enriched in CCL-3, -4, -5, -8, -23, CXCL-1, -3, -6, -10, and IL1, -23, -27, -34, and had higher expression of macrophage markers compared with immune-rich cancers with pCR that were enriched in IFN&#x3b3;, IL2, -12, -21, chemokines CXCL-9, -13, CXCR5, and activated T- and B-cell markers (GZMB, CD79A). In the validation cohort, an immune-rich five-gene signature showed higher expression in pCR cases in the durvalumab arm (P = 0.040) but not in the placebo arm (P = 0.923) or in immune-poor cancers. Independent of immune markers, tumor mutation burden was higher, and PI3K, DNA damage repair, MAPK, and WNT/&#x3b2;-catenin signaling pathways were enriched in germline and somatic mutations in cases with pCR. The TGF&#x3b2; pathway is associated with immune-poor phenotype and RD in bTNBC.

Several studies have identified the chemokine CXCL9 as a robust prognosticator of improved survival in ovarian cancer and a characteristic of the immunoreactive subtype, which predicts ICB response. However, the function of CXCL9 in ovarian cancer has been poorly studied. Impact of Cxcl9 overexpression in the murine ID8-Trp53<sup>-/-</sup> and ID8-Trp53<sup>-/-</sup>Brca2<sup>-/-</sup> ovarian cancer models on survival, cellular immune composition, PD-L1 expression and anti-PD-L1 therapy. CXCL9 expression analysis in ovarian cancer subtypes and correlation to reported ICB response. CXCL9 overexpression resulted in T-cell accumulation, delayed ascites formation and improved survival, which was dependent on adaptive immune function. In the ICB-resistant mouse model, the chemokine was sufficient to enable a successful anti-PD-L1 therapy. In contrast, these effects were abrogated in Brca2-deficient tumours, most likely due to an already high intrinsic chemokine expression. Finally, in ovarian cancer patients, the clear-cell subtype, known to respond best to ICB, displayed a significantly higher proportion of CXCL9<sup>high</sup> tumours than the other subtypes. CXCL9 is a driver of successful ICB in preclinical ovarian cancer. Besides being a feasible predictive biomarker, CXCL9-inducing agents thus represent attractive combination partners to improve ICB in this cancer entity.",2022,Animals; B7-H1 Antigen; Chemokine CXCL9; Female; Humans; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors; Mice; Ovarian Neoplasms,22
34951647,CXCL9,10.1093/neuonc/noab292,ATRX loss promotes immunosuppressive mechanisms in IDH1 mutant glioma.,"ATRX inactivation occurs with IDH1R132H and p53 mutations in over 80% of Grades II/III astrocytomas. It is believed that ATRX loss contributes to oncogenesis by dysregulating epigenetic and telomere mechanisms but effects on anti-glioma immunity have not been explored. This paper examines how ATRX loss contributes to the malignant and immunosuppressive phenotypes of IDH1R132H/p53mut glioma cells and xenografts. Isogenic astrocytoma cells (+/-IDH1R132H/+/-ATRXloss) were established in p53mut astrocytoma cell lines using lentivirus encoding doxycycline-inducible IDH1R132H, ATRX shRNA, or Lenti-CRISPR/Cas9 ATRX. Effects of IDH1R132H+/-ATRXloss on cell migration, growth, DNA repair, and tumorigenicity were evaluated by clonal growth, transwell and scratch assays, MTT, immunofluorence and immunoblotting assays, and xenograft growth. Effects on the expression and function of modulators of the immune microenvironment were quantified by qRT-PCR, immunoblot, T-cell function, macrophage polarization, and flow cytometry assays. Pharmacologic inhibitors were used to examine epigenetic drivers of the immunosuppressive transcriptome of IDH1R132H/p53mut/ATRXloss cells. Adding ATRX loss to the IDH1R132H/p53mut background promoted astrocytoma cell aggressiveness, induced expression of BET proteins BRD3/4 and an immune-suppressive transcriptome consisting of up-regulated immune checkpoints (e.g., PD-L1, PD-L2) and altered cytokine/chemokine profiles (e.g., IL33, CXCL8, CSF2, IL6, CXCL9). ATRX loss enhanced the capacity of IDH1R132H/p53mut cells to induce T-cell apoptosis, tumorigenic/anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization and Treg infiltration. The transcriptional and biological immune-suppressive responses to ATRX loss were enhanced by temozolomide and radiation and abrogated by pharmacologic BET inhibition. ATRX loss activates a BRD-dependent immune-suppressive transcriptome and immune escape mechanism in IDH1R132H/p53mut astrocytoma cells.",2022,ATRX loss; BRD-dependent immune-suppressive transcriptome; IDH1 mutant astrocytoma; glioma immune microenvironment; Astrocytoma; Brain Neoplasms; Carcinogenesis; Glioma; Humans; Isocitrate Dehydrogenase; Mutation; Tumor Microenvironment; X-linked Nuclear Protein,22

Starting with mAb to cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors in metastatic melanoma and continuing with blockers of the interactions between program cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand program cell death ligand 1 (PDL-1) or program cell death ligand 2 (PDL-2), that have been approved for about 20 different indications. Yet for many cancers, ICI shows limited success. Several lines of evidence imply that the limited success in cancer immunotherapy is associated with attempts to treat patients with ""cold tumors"" that either lack effector T cells, or in which these cells are markedly suppressed by regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>). Chemokines are a well-defined group of proteins that were so named due to their chemotactic properties. The current review focuses on key chemokines that not only attract leukocytes but also shape their biological properties. CXCR3 is a chemokine receptor with 3 ligands. We suggest using Ig-based fusion proteins of two of them: CXL9 and CXCL10, to enhance anti-tumor immunity and perhaps transform cold tumors into hot tumors. Potential differences between CXCL9 and CXCL10 regarding ICI are discussed. We also discuss the possibility of targeting the function or deleting a key subset of T<sub>regs</sub> that are CCR8<sup>+</sup> by monoclonal antibodies to CCR8. These cells are preferentially abundant in several tumors and are likely to be the key drivers in suppressing anti-cancer immune reactivity.",2021,CCL1; CCR8; CXCL10; CXCL9; cancer immunotherapy; chemokine receptors; chemokines; immune checkpoint inhibitors; regulatory T cells,22

Thus, identification of genomic drivers and delineation of the underlying mechanisms are urgently needed. Here, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening in liver-specific Smad4/Pten knockout mice (<i>Smad4<sup>co/co</sup>;Pten<sup>co/co</sup>;Alb-Cre,</i> abbreviated as SPC), and identified 15 putative tumor suppressor genes, including Cullin3 (Cul3), whose deficiency increases protein levels of Nrf2 and Cyclin D1 that accelerate cholangiocytes expansion leading to the initiation of CC. Meanwhile, Cul3 deficiency also increases the secretion of Cxcl9 in stromal cells to attract T cells infiltration, and increases the production of Amphiregulin (Areg) mediated by Nrf2, which paracrinely induces inflammation in the liver, and promotes accumulation of exhausted PD1<sup>high</sup> CD8 T cells at the expenses of their cytotoxic activity, allowing CC progression. We demonstrate that the anti-PD1/PD-L1 blockade inhibits CC growth, and the effect is enhanced by combining with sorafenib selected from organoid mediated drug sensitive test.

A driver of fibrosis is the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway, and Kyn metabolism patterns and cytokines may influence cGVHD severity and manifestation (fibrosing versus gastrointestinal [GI] cGVHD). Using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach on sera obtained from 425 patients with allografts, we identified high CXCL9, high indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity, and an activated Kyn pathway as common characteristics in all cGVHD subtypes. Specific Kyn metabolism patterns could be identified for non-severe cGVHD, severe GI cGVHD, and fibrosing cGVHD, respectively. Specifically, fibrosing cGVHD was associated with a distinct pathway shift toward anthranilic and kynurenic acid, correlating with reduced activity of the vitamin-B2-dependent kynurenine monooxygenase, low vitamin B6, and increased interleukin-18.

However, the biomarkers for response and prognosis stratification of HCC first-line combined immunotherapy have not been clarified. Here, we obtained the genomic alteration data from pre-therapeutic samples of 103 HCC patients using a 605-gene NGS test, and obtained the transcriptional and T cell receptor (TCR) diversity data from 18 patients who underwent the first-line combined immunotherapy using RNAseq and TCR sequencing, respectively. Patients received sorafenib/sintilimab or lenvatinib/sintilimab combined first-line therapy and the response was assessed at 3-6 cycles of therapy. No stratification of response was found in high-frequency key driver gene mutations, including TP53 and TERT. However, significantly higher ratio of progression (PD) was found in patients carrying MDM4 amplification. Similarly, FGF/3/4/19 amplifications could also result in high ratio of PD. The mRNA and lncRNA levels of eight genes related to hepatic metabolism and immune microenvironment exhibited significant differences between PR/SD and PD group, including DGKI, TNFSF14, CHST4, ACTIN1, PFKP, SLC51B, LCK and ERN1, suggesting stratification of response. Furthermore, moderate correlation was identified between the stratification genes (CHST4, SLC51B and ERN1) and immune factors (TIGIT, CD34, ICAM1, CCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL10), suggesting potential roles of these factors in immunoregulation. Strong linear correlation was found between any two of the three indexes for TCR CDR3 diversity, including Shannon-Wiener Index, Simpson index and evenness. However, no significant difference was found in the three indexes between the PR/SD and PD group, suggesting no stratification of response by these indexes. We identified several potential biomarkers for response stratification in the first-line combined immunotherapy.

34016720,CXCL9,10.1136/jitc-2020-001335,Druggable epigenetic suppression of interferon-induced chemokine expression linked to <i>MYCN</i> amplification in neuroblastoma.,"Amplification of the <i>MYCN</i> oncogene is a molecular hallmark of aggressive neuroblastoma (NB), a childhood cancer of the sympathetic nervous system. There is evidence that <i>MYCN</i> promotes a non-inflamed and T-cell infiltration-poor ('cold') tumor microenvironment (TME) by suppressing interferon signaling. This may explain, at least in part, why patients with NB seem to have little benefit from single-agent immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Targeting MYCN or its effectors could be a strategy to convert a cold TME into a 'hot' (inflamed) TME and improve the efficacy of ICB therapy. NB transcriptome analyses were used to identify epigenetic drivers of a T-cell infiltration-poor TME. Biological and molecular responses of NB cells to epigenetic drugs and interferon (IFN)-&#x3b3; exposure were assessed by proliferation assays, immunoblotting, ELISA, qRT-PCR, RNA-seq and ChIP-qPCR as well as co-culture assays with T cells. We identified H3K9 euchromatic histone-lysine methyltransferases EHMT2 and EHMT1, also known as G9a and GLP, as epigenetic effectors of the <i>MYCN</i>-driven malignant phenotype and repressors of IFN-&#x3b3; transcriptional responses in NB cells. EHMT inhibitors enhanced IFN-&#x3b3;-induced expression of the Th1-type chemokines <i>CXCL9</i> and <i>CXCL10</i>, key factors of T-cell recruitment into the TME. In <i>MYCN</i>-amplified NB cells, co-inhibition of EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homologue 2), a H3K27 histone methyltransferase cooperating with EHMTs, was needed for strong transcriptional responses to IFN-&#x3b3;, in line with histone mark changes at <i>CXCL9</i> and <i>CXCL10</i> chemokine gene loci. EHMT and EZH2 inhibitor response gene signatures from NB cells were established as surrogate measures and revealed high EHMT and EZH2 activity in <i>MYCN</i>-amplified high-risk NBs with a cold immune phenotype. Our results delineate a strategy for targeted epigenetic immunomodulation of high-risk NBs, whereby EHMT inhibitors alone or in combination with EZH2 inhibitors (in particular, <i>MYCN</i>-amplified NBs) could promote a T-cell-infiltrated TME via enhanced Th1-type chemokine expression.",2022,"immunomodulation; immunotherapy; inflammation; neuroblastoma; tumor microenvironment; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Line, Tumor; Chemokines; Coculture Techniques; Enzyme Inhibitors; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Amplification; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Histocompatibility Antigens; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Humans; Interferon-gamma; Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating; Molecular Targeted Therapy; N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein; Neuroblastoma; Signal Transduction; T-Lymphocytes; Transcriptome; Tumor Microenvironment",22

We present evidence from patient samples and cell lines that alterations in chromosome dosage contribute to an immune hot-to-cold switch during human papillomavirus-negative (HPV<sup>-</sup>) head and neck tumorigenesis. Overall SCNA (aneuploidy) level was associated with increased CD3<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell microenvironments in precancer (mostly CD3<sup>+</sup>, linked to trisomy and aneuploidy), but with T cell-deficient tumors. Early lesions with 9p21.3 loss were associated with depletion of cytotoxic T cell infiltration in <i>TP53</i> mutant tumors; and with aneuploidy were associated with increased NK-cell infiltration. The strongest driver of cytotoxic T cell and Immune Score depletion in oral cancer was 9p-arm level loss, promoting profound decreases of pivotal IFN-&#x3b3;-related chemokines (e.g., CXCL9) and pathway genes. Chromosome 9p21.3 deletion contributed mainly to cell-intrinsic senescence suppression, but deletion of the entire arm was necessary to diminish levels of cytokine, JAK-STAT, and Hallmark NF-&#x3ba;B pathways. Finally, 9p arm-level loss and <i>JAK2</i>-<i>PD-L1</i> codeletion (at 9p24) were predictive markers of poor survival in recurrent HPV<sup>-</sup> HNSC after anti-PD-1 therapy; likely amplified by independent aneuploidy-induced immune-cold microenvironments observed here. We hypothesize that 9p21.3 arm-loss expansion and epistatic interactions allow oral precancer cells to acquire properties to overcome a proimmunogenic aneuploid checkpoint, transform and invade.

Baseline and week-12 plasma samples from the PIONEER studies were used to assess the levels of circulating proteins by multiplex and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Analyses revealed significantly higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 16 (HCC-4) levels in nonresponders at baseline and identified a multivariate response signature of calprotectin, fractalkine and HCC-4, reaching an 86% predictive accuracy rate for adalimumab response. Additionally, post-treatment reduction of plasma C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)9, CXCL8 (interleukin-8) and CCL19 (macrophage inflammatory protein 3&#x3b2;) were greater in adalimumab super-responders than in nonresponders (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;026, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;044 and P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;026, respectively). These cytokines are involved in the recruitment of innate and adaptive inflammatory cells, and/or stimulation of certain inflammatory responses, suggesting that these pathways could be disease drivers in adalimumab nonresponders. These initial results suggest HCC-4, calprotectin and fractalkine could be potential predictive biomarkers of adalimumab response in HS and identified possible tumour necrosis factor-independent disease pathways.",2021,"Adalimumab; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Biomarkers; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Hidradenitis Suppurativa; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome",22

Treatments based on modifying the immune cell infiltrate of the tumor microenvironment are thus gaining momentum. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the effects of gene therapy with two proinflammatory chemokines CCL5 and CCL17 on inflammatory cytokine expression profile and immune cell infiltrate in two murine breast tumor models, 4T1 and E0771, and two murine colon tumor models, CT26 and MC38. In vitro, lipofection of plasmid DNA encoding CCL5 or CCL17 resulted in changes in the cytokine expression profile similar to control plasmid DNA, implying that the main driver of these changes was the entry of foreign DNA into the cell's cytosol. In vivo, gene electrotransfer resulted in high expression levels of both Ccl5 and Ccl17 transgenes in the 4T1 and CT26 tumor models. Besides a minor increase in the survival of the treated mice, the therapy also resulted in increased expression of Cxcl9 and Ifn&#x3b3;, potent activators of the immune system, in CT26 tumors. However, this was not recapitulated in changes of TME, implying that a further refinement of the dosing schedule is needed.",2021,"CCL17; CCL5; Chemokines; Cytokine expression; Gene electrotransfer; Murine tumors; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Chemokine CCL17; Chemokine CCL5; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genetic Therapy; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Neoplasms; Transcriptome; Tumor Microenvironment",22

CXCL11 binds CXCR3 with a higher affinity than the other ligands leading to receptor internalization. Long ago we reported that one of these chemokines, CXCL10, not only attracts CXCR3+ CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells to sites of inflammation, but also direct their polarization into highly potent effector T cells. Later we showed that CXCL11 directs the linage development of T-regulatory-1 cells (Tr1). We also observed that CXCL11 and CXCL10 induce different signaling cascades via CXCR3. Collectively this suggests that CXCR3 ligands differentially regulate the biological function of T cells via biased signaling. It is generally accepted that tumor cells evolved to express several chemokine receptors and secrete their ligands. Vast majority of these chemokines support tumor growth by different mechanisms that are discussed. We suggest that CXCL10 and possibly CXCL9 differ from other chemokines by their ability to restrain tumor growth and enhance anti-tumor immunity. Along with this an accumulating number of studies showed in various human cancers a clear association between poor prognosis and low expression of CXCL10 at tumor sites, and vice versa. Finally, we discuss the possibility that CXCL9 and CXCL10 may differ in their biological function via biased signaling and its possible relevance to cancer immunotherapy. The current mini review focuses on exploring the role of CXCR3 ligands in directing the biological properties of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the context of cancer and autoimmunity. We believe that the combined role of these chemokines in attracting T cells and also directing their biological properties makes them key drivers of immune function.",2021,"CXCL10; CXCL9; CXCR3; EAE; cancer; chemokines; tolerance; Animals; Autoimmunity; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Chemokine CXCL10; Chemokine CXCL11; Chemokine CXCL9; Chemotaxis, Leukocyte; Humans; Immune Tolerance; Ligands; Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating; Neoplasms; Receptors, CXCR3; Signal Transduction; Tumor Microenvironment",22

Here, we explore the association of chemokine expression with effector T-cell infiltration in PDAC. Discovery cohorts comprised 113 primary resected PDAC and 107 PDAC liver metastases. Validation cohorts comprised 182 PDAC from The Cancer Genome Atlas and 92 PDACs from the Australian International Cancer Genome Consortium. We explored associations between immune cell counts by immunohistochemistry, chemokine expression, and transcriptional hallmarks of antitumor immunity by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and mutational burden by whole-genome sequencing. Among all known human chemokines, a coregulated set of four (<i>CCL4, CCL5, CXCL9</i>, and <i>CXCL10</i>) was strongly associated with CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Expression of this ""4-chemokine signature"" positively correlated with transcriptional metrics of T-cell activation (<i>ZAP70, ITK</i>, and <i>IL2RB</i>), cytolytic activity (<i>GZMA</i> and <i>PRF1</i>), and immunosuppression (<i>PDL1, PD1, CTLA4, TIM3, TIGIT, LAG3, FASLG</i>, and <i>IDO1</i>). Furthermore, the 4-chemokine signature marked tumors with increased T-cell activation scores (MHC I presentation, T-cell/APC costimulation) and elevated expression of innate immune sensing pathways involved in T-cell priming (STING and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways, BATF3-driven dendritic cells). Importantly, expression of this 4-chemokine signature was consistently indicative of a T-cell-inflamed phenotype across primary PDAC and PDAC liver metastases. A conserved 4-chemokine signature marks resectable and metastatic PDAC tumors with an active antitumor phenotype. This could have implications for the appropriate selection of PDAC patients in immunotherapy trials.",2021,"Biomarkers, Tumor; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Chemokine CCL4; Chemokine CCL5; Chemokine CXCL10; Chemokine CXCL9; Cohort Studies; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Humans; Immune Checkpoint Proteins; Immunotherapy; Liver Neoplasms; Mutation; Pancreatic Neoplasms; RNA-Seq",22

However, the association of with OX-40 protein expression with clinical outcomes and pathological features in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are largely unknown. Surgically-resected stage I-III NSCLC specimens (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;100) were stained by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the following immune markers: OX-40, PD-L1, PD-1, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, CD57, CD68, FOXP3, granzyme B, and ICOS. Immune-related markers mRNA expression were also assessed. We evaluated the association of OX-40 levels with major clinicopathologic variables, including molecular driver mutations. OX-40 IHC expression was observed in all tested tumors, predominantly localized in the membrane of the tumor immune infiltrate, and was not associated with a specific clinicopathologic or molecular subtype. High OX-40 expression levels measured by IHC median score were associated with better overall survival (OS) (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), independent of CD3/CD8, PD-L1, and ICOS expression. High OX-40 IHC score was associated with increased expression of immune-related genes such as CD3, IFN-gamma, ICOS, CD8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL5, granzyme K. High OX-40 IHC expression in the tumor immune infiltrate is associated with favorable prognosis and increased levels of immune-related genes including IFN-gamma in patients with surgically resected stage I-III NSCLC. Its prognostic utility is independent of PD-L1 and other common markers of immune activation.

We and others have shown that IL-17 mainly signals to tumor cells to promote CRC, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. IL-17 also dampens Th1-armed anti-tumor immunity, in part by attracting myeloid cells to tumor. Whether IL-17 controls the activity of adaptive immune cells in a more direct manner, however, is unknown. Using mouse models of sporadic or inducible colorectal cancers, we ablated IL-17RA in the whole body or specifically in colorectal tumor cells. We also performed adoptive bone marrow reconstitution to knockout CXCR3 in hematopoietic cells. Histological and immunological experimental methods were used to reveal the link among IL-17, chemokine production, and CRC development. Loss of IL-17 signaling in mouse CRC resulted in marked increase in the recruitment of CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), starting from early stage CRC lesions. This is accompanied by the increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-&#x3b2;. IL-17 signaling also inhibits the production of T cell attracting chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 by tumor cells. Conversely, the inability of hematopoietic cells to respond to CXCL9/10 resulted in decreased tumor infiltration by CTLs and Tregs, decreased levels of IL-10 and TGF-&#x3b2;, and increased numbers of tumor lesions. Blockade of IL-17 signaling resulted in increased expression of immune checkpoint markers. On the other hand, treatment of mouse CRC with anti-CTLA-4 antibody led to increased expression of pro-tumor IL-17. IL-17 signals to colorectal tumor cells and inhibits their production of CXCL9/10 chemokines. By doing so, IL-17 inhibits the infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs and Tregs to CRC, thus promoting CRC development. Cancer immunotherapy may be benefited by the use of anti-IL-17 agents as adjuvant therapies, which serve to block both IL-17-mediated tumor promotion and T cell exclusion.",2020,"And colorectal cancer; CXCL10; CXCL9; Interleukin-17; Regulatory T cell; Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Line, Tumor; Chemokine CXCL10; Chemokine CXCL9; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cytokines; Gene Expression; Humans; Interleukin-17; Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Models, Biological; Neoplasm Staging; Signal Transduction; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory",22

However, little is known about the downstream effectors of type I IFN signaling that amplify autoimmune responses. Here, we have used a chemokine reporter mouse to determine the CXCR3 ligand responses in DCs subsets. Following TLR7 stimulation, conventional type 1 and type 2 DCs (cDC1 and cDC2, respectively) uniformly upregulate CXCL10. By contrast, the proportion of chemokine positive pDCs was significantly less, and stable CXCL10<sup>+</sup> and CXCL10<sup>-</sup> populations could be distinguished. CXCL9 expression was induced in all cDC1s, in half of the cDC2 but not by pDCs. The requirement for IFNAR signaling for chemokine reporter expression was interrogated by receptor blocking and deficiency and shown to be critical for CXCR3 ligand expression in Flt3-ligand-derived DCs. Chemokine-producing potential was not concordant with the previously identified markers of pDC heterogeneity. Finally, we show that CXCL10<sup>+</sup> and CXCL10<sup>-</sup> populations are transcriptionally distinct, expressing unique transcriptional regulators, IFN signaling molecules, chemokines, cytokines, and cell surface markers. This work highlights CXCL10 as a downstream effector of type I IFN signaling and suggests a division of labor in pDCs subtypes that likely impacts their function as effectors of viral responses and as drivers of inflammation.",2019,"CXCR3; Chemokine; IFNAR1; IMQ; SLE; TLR7; conventional DC; plasmacytoid DC; type 1 IFN; Animals; B-Lymphocytes; Biomarkers; Cells, Cultured; Chemokine CXCL10; Cytokines; Dendritic Cells; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Immunophenotyping; Interferon Type I; Mice; Receptors, CXCR3; Signal Transduction; Toll-Like Receptor 7",22
36092893,TIGIT,10.3389/fgene.2022.921447,Evolutionary selection identifies critical immune-relevant genes in lung cancer subtypes.,"In an evolving population, proliferation is dependent on fitness so that a numerically dominant population typically possesses the most well adapted phenotype. In contrast, the evolutionary ""losers"" typically disappear from the population so that their genetic record is lost. Historically, cancer research has focused on observed genetic mutations in the dominant tumor cell populations which presumably increase fitness. Negative selection, i.e., removal of deleterious mutations from a population, is not observable but can provide critical information regarding genes involved in essential cellular processes. Similar to immunoediting, ""evolutionary triage"" eliminates mutations in tumor cells that increase susceptibility to the host immune response while mutations that shield them from immune attack increase proliferation and are readily observable (e.g., B2M mutations). These dynamics permit an ""inverse problem"" analysis linking the fitness consequences of a mutation to its prevalence in a tumor cohort. This is evident in ""driver mutations"" but, equally important, can identify essential genes in which mutations are seen significantly less than expected by chance. Here we utilized this new approach to investigate evolutionary triage in immune-related genes from TCGA lung adenocarcinoma cohorts. Negative selection differs between the two cohorts and is observed in endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase genes, ERAP1 and ERAP2 genes, and DNAM-1/TIGIT ligands. Targeting genes or molecular pathways under positive or negative evolutionary selection may permit new treatment options and increase the efficacy of current immunotherapy.",2022,cancer evolution; cancer immunology; evolutionary triage; gene conservation; immune evasion,12

High levels of immunosuppressive Tregs predict inferior response to chemotherapy, leukemia relapse, and shorter survival. However, mechanisms that promote Tregs in myeloid leukemias remain largely unexplored. Here, we identify leukemic extracellular vesicles (EVs) as drivers of effector proleukemic Tregs. Using mouse model of leukemia-like disease, we found that Rab27a-dependent secretion of leukemic EVs promoted leukemia engraftment, which was associated with higher abundance of activated, immunosuppressive Tregs. Leukemic EVs attenuated mTOR-S6 and activated STAT5 signaling, as well as evoked significant transcriptomic changes in Tregs. We further identified specific effector signature of Tregs promoted by leukemic EVs. Leukemic EVs-driven Tregs were characterized by elevated expression of effector/tumor Treg markers CD39, CCR8, CD30, TNFR2, CCR4, TIGIT, and IL21R and included 2 distinct effector Treg (eTreg) subsets: CD30+CCR8hiTNFR2hi eTreg1 and CD39+TIGIThi eTreg2. Finally, we showed that costimulatory ligand 4-1BBL/CD137L, shuttled by leukemic EVs, promoted suppressive activity and effector phenotype of Tregs by regulating expression of receptors such as CD30 and TNFR2. Collectively, our work highlights the role of leukemic extracellular vesicles in stimulation of immunosuppressive Tregs and leukemia growth.

However, the biomarkers for response and prognosis stratification of HCC first-line combined immunotherapy have not been clarified. Here, we obtained the genomic alteration data from pre-therapeutic samples of 103 HCC patients using a 605-gene NGS test, and obtained the transcriptional and T cell receptor (TCR) diversity data from 18 patients who underwent the first-line combined immunotherapy using RNAseq and TCR sequencing, respectively. Patients received sorafenib/sintilimab or lenvatinib/sintilimab combined first-line therapy and the response was assessed at 3-6 cycles of therapy. No stratification of response was found in high-frequency key driver gene mutations, including TP53 and TERT. However, significantly higher ratio of progression (PD) was found in patients carrying MDM4 amplification. Similarly, FGF/3/4/19 amplifications could also result in high ratio of PD. The mRNA and lncRNA levels of eight genes related to hepatic metabolism and immune microenvironment exhibited significant differences between PR/SD and PD group, including DGKI, TNFSF14, CHST4, ACTIN1, PFKP, SLC51B, LCK and ERN1, suggesting stratification of response. Furthermore, moderate correlation was identified between the stratification genes (CHST4, SLC51B and ERN1) and immune factors (TIGIT, CD34, ICAM1, CCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL10), suggesting potential roles of these factors in immunoregulation. Strong linear correlation was found between any two of the three indexes for TCR CDR3 diversity, including Shannon-Wiener Index, Simpson index and evenness. However, no significant difference was found in the three indexes between the PR/SD and PD group, suggesting no stratification of response by these indexes.

Although the pathogenesis of AIH remains unclear, impaired regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been considered a driver of AIH development. Unlike autoreactive T cells, Tregs mainly utilize oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) as their energy supply. Elevated glycolysis has been reported to limit the suppressive functions of Tregs. However, whether glucose metabolism reprogramming in Tregs is involved in AIH etiology remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine alternations in Treg numbers and functions in AIH patients and concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis, while exploring associations between impaired Tregs and glucose metabolism. The frequency of Tregs was decreased in the peripheral blood but increased in liver biopsies of AIH patients. Moreover, immunosuppressive therapy rescued circulating Tregs in AIH. In Con A-induced immune hepatitis, enhanced intrahepatic Treg accumulation was observed over time, accompanied by reduced splenic Treg numbers. To investigate whether functional impairment of Tregs occurs in AIH, Tregs were isolated from experimental AIH (EAH) model mice and normal controls and the former displayed downregulated mRNA levels of FOXP3, CTLA4, CD103, TIGIT, CD39, and CD73. EAH model-derived Tregs also produced fewer anti-inflammatory mediators (TGF-&#x3b2; and IL-35) than control Tregs. Moreover, enhanced glycolysis and reduced OXPHOS were found in Tregs from EAH model mice, as reflected by elevated levels of key glycolytic enzymes (HK2, PK-M2, and LDH-A) and a decreased ATP concentration. This study revealed a decreased peripheral Treg frequency and abnormal intrahepatic Treg infiltration in AIH. It is first reported that glucose metabolism reprogramming is associated with decreases and functional impairments in the Treg population, promoting AIH development.

Oncogenic driver alterations such as <i>EGFR</i> mutation, <i>ALK</i> translocation, <i>ROS1</i> translocation, and <i>BRAF</i> mutation predict response to treatment for LUAD. Since oncogenic driver alterations may modulate immune response in tumor microenvironment that may influence prognosis in LUAD, the effects of <i>EGFR</i>, <i>ALK</i>, <i>ROS1</i>, and <i>BRAF</i> alterations on tumor microenvironment remain unclear. Immune-related prognostic model associated with oncogenic driver alterations is needed. In this study, we performed the Cox-proportional Hazards Analysis based on the L1-penalized (LASSO) Analysis to establish an immune-related prognostic model (IPM) in stage I-II LUAD patients, which was based on 3 immune-related genes (<i>PDE4B</i>, <i>RIPK2</i>, and <i>IFITM1</i>) significantly enriched in patients without <i>EGFR</i>, <i>ALK</i>, <i>ROS1</i>, and <i>BRAF</i> alterations in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.

Here, we explore the association of chemokine expression with effector T-cell infiltration in PDAC. Discovery cohorts comprised 113 primary resected PDAC and 107 PDAC liver metastases. Validation cohorts comprised 182 PDAC from The Cancer Genome Atlas and 92 PDACs from the Australian International Cancer Genome Consortium. We explored associations between immune cell counts by immunohistochemistry, chemokine expression, and transcriptional hallmarks of antitumor immunity by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and mutational burden by whole-genome sequencing. Among all known human chemokines, a coregulated set of four (<i>CCL4, CCL5, CXCL9</i>, and <i>CXCL10</i>) was strongly associated with CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Expression of this ""4-chemokine signature"" positively correlated with transcriptional metrics of T-cell activation (<i>ZAP70, ITK</i>, and <i>IL2RB</i>), cytolytic activity (<i>GZMA</i> and <i>PRF1</i>), and immunosuppression (<i>PDL1, PD1, CTLA4, TIM3, TIGIT, LAG3, FASLG</i>, and <i>IDO1</i>). Furthermore, the 4-chemokine signature marked tumors with increased T-cell activation scores (MHC I presentation, T-cell/APC costimulation) and elevated expression of innate immune sensing pathways involved in T-cell priming (STING and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways, BATF3-driven dendritic cells). Importantly, expression of this 4-chemokine signature was consistently indicative of a T-cell-inflamed phenotype across primary PDAC and PDAC liver metastases. A conserved 4-chemokine signature marks resectable and metastatic PDAC tumors with an active antitumor phenotype. This could have implications for the appropriate selection of PDAC patients in immunotherapy trials.",2021,"Biomarkers, Tumor; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Chemokine CCL4; Chemokine CCL5; Chemokine CXCL10; Chemokine CXCL9; Cohort Studies; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Humans; Immune Checkpoint Proteins; Immunotherapy; Liver Neoplasms; Mutation; Pancreatic Neoplasms; RNA-Seq",12

Our aim was to examine how the immune landscape relates to different aspects of the CRC's biology, including neoepitope burden. We used TCGA data to stratify patients based on a cytolytic T-cell activity expression index and correlated immune cytolytic activity (CYT) with mutational, structural, and neoepitope features of each tumor sample. The expression of several immune checkpoints was verified in an independent cohort of 72 CRC patients, relative to their MSI status, using immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR. CRC exhibits a range of intertumoral cytolytic T-cell activity, with lower cytolytic levels in the tumor, compared to the normal tissue. We separated CRC patients into CYT-high and CYT-low subgroups. High cytolytic activity correlated with increased mutational load in colon tumors, the count of MHC-I/-II classically defined and alternatively defined neoepitopes, high microsatellite instability and deregulated expression of several inhibitory immune checkpoints (VISTA, TIGIT, PD-1, IDO1, CTLA-4, and PD-L1, among others). Many immune checkpoint molecules (IDO1, LAG3, TIGIT, VISTA, PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4) expressed significantly higher in MSI+ CRCs compared to MSS tumors. The expression of Treg markers was also significantly higher in CYT-high tumors. Both individual and simultaneous high levels of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 had a positive effect on the patients' overall survival. On the reverse, simultaneous low expression of both genes led to a significant shift towards negative effect. Assessed globally, CYT-low CRCs contained more recurrent somatic copy number alterations. PD-L1 protein was absent in most samples in the independent cohort and stained lowly in 33% of MSI CRCs. PD-L1+ CRCs stained moderately for CD8 and weakly for FOXP3. CYT-high colon tumors had higher TIL load, whereas CYT-high rectum tumors had higher TAN load compared to their CYT-low counterparts. Overall, we highlight the link between different genetic events and the immune microenvironment in CRC, taking into consideration the status of microsatellite instability.

Here, using RNA and protein expression profiling at single-cell resolution in mouse cells, we identify a module of co-inhibitory receptors that includes not only several known co-inhibitory receptors (PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3 and TIGIT) but also many new surface receptors. We functionally validated two new co-inhibitory receptors, activated protein C receptor (PROCR) and podoplanin (PDPN). The module of co-inhibitory receptors is co-expressed in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and is part of a larger co-inhibitory gene program that is shared by non-responsive T cells in several physiological contexts and is driven by the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-27. Computational analysis identified the transcription factors PRDM1 and c-MAF as cooperative regulators of the co-inhibitory module, and this was validated experimentally.

However, only in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) has the connection to tumorigenesis been established. Previously, eccrine porocarcinoma samples were shown to express MCPyV in the majority of samples. We aimed to examine MCPyV in porocarcinoma and poroma samples using MCC as the reference material. We analyzed 17 porocarcinoma and 50 poroma samples for the presence of MCPyV using LT antigen immunostaining and DNA detection methods. In addition, 180 MCC samples served as controls. MCPyV LT antigen immunostaining was detected in 10% of poroma and 18% of porocarcinoma samples; on the other hand, it was present in 65% of MCC samples. MCPyV DNA was detected in only 10% of poroma and porocarcinoma samples compared with 96% of MCC samples. The viral DNA copy number in all MCPyV DNA-positive MCCs was at least 25 times higher than that in porocarcinoma or poroma samples with the highest MCPyV DNA-to-PTPRG ratio. The low number of viral DNA copies in poroma and porocarcinoma samples, together with the negative LT expression of MCPyV DNA-positive tumors, indicates that MCPyV is simply a passenger virus rather than an oncogenic driver of porocarcinoma.",2022,"Merkel cell polyomavirus; eccrine porocarcinoma; poroma; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Merkel Cell; Child; Eccrine Porocarcinoma; Female; Humans; Male; Merkel cell polyomavirus; Middle Aged; Polyomavirus Infections; Sweat Gland Neoplasms; Tumor Virus Infections",4

Notwithstanding development of several novel therapeutic interventions including poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors, this family of malignancies remain deadly. The human microbiome project demonstrated that dysbiosis of health resident microflora is associated with several pathologies including malignancies of the female reproductive tract and detailed characterization of species variation and host-microbe interaction could provide clues for identification of early diagnostic biomarker, preventive and therapeutic interventions. Emerging evidence suggests that several microbial signatures are significantly associated with gynecological cancers. An increased population of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes followed by significantly reduced Lactobacilli are associated with lethal epithelial ovarian cancer. Similarly, a constant association of elevated level of Atopobium vaginae, Porphyromonas somerae, Micrococci and Gardnerella vaginalis are observed in endometrial and cervical cancers. Moreover, human papilloma virus infection significantly augments colonization of pathogenic microbes including Sneathia sanguinegens, Anaerococcus tetradius, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and drives carcinoma of the cervix. Interestingly, microbial dysbiosis in female reproductive tract modulates expression of several microbial and immune-responsive genes such as TLR-4, TLR-5, TLR-6 and NOD-1. Therefore, stringent investigation into the microbial dysbiosis and its underlying mechanism could provide valuable cues for identification of early diagnostic biomarker, preventive and therapeutic interventions against rogue gynecological malignancies.",2022,"Cancer therapeutics; Gynecological cancers; Human microbiome; Microbial dysbiosis; Tumor biomarker; Biomarkers; Dysbiosis; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Humans; Lactobacillus; Microbiota",1

Unlike canonical oncogenes, NUAK1 is rarely mutated in cancer and appears to function as an obligate facilitator rather than a cancer driver per se. Although numerous groups have developed small-molecule NUAK inhibitors, the circumstances that would trigger their use and the unwanted toxicities that may arise as a consequence of on-target activity are thus undetermined. Reasoning that MYC is a key effector of RAS pathway signalling and the GTPase KRAS is almost uniformly mutated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we investigated whether this cancer type exhibits a functional requirement for NUAK1. Here, we show that high NUAK1 expression is associated with reduced overall survival in PDAC and that inhibition or depletion of NUAK1 suppresses growth of PDAC cells in culture. We identify a previously unknown role for NUAK1 in regulating accurate centrosome duplication and show that loss of NUAK1 triggers genomic instability. The latter activity is conserved in primary fibroblasts, raising the possibility of undesirable genotoxic effects of NUAK1 inhibition.",2023,GSK3&#x3b2;; MYPT1; NUAK1; PDAC; centrosome replication; genomic instability,1

Our previous work indicates that NK cells migrate to EAC omentum, where they undergo phenotypic and functional alterations and apoptosis. In this study, we investigate whether such erroneous chemotaxis to omentum is paralleled by compromised NK cell infiltration of EAC patient tumor and examine the role of the inflammatory chemokine fractalkine in shaping the NK cell-mediated response. Our data show diminished NK cell frequencies in EAC tumor compared with those in the circulation and reveal that intratumoral NK cell frequencies decline as visceral obesity increases in EAC patients. Our in vitro findings demonstrate that antagonism of fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 significantly reduces NK cell migration to EAC patient-derived, omental adipose tissue-conditioned media, but not toward tumor-conditioned media. These data suggest fractalkine is a key driver of NK cell chemotaxis to omentum but has a lesser role in NK cell homing to tumor in EAC. We propose that this may offer a novel therapeutic strategy to limit NK cell depletion in the omentum of obese EAC patients, and our data suggest the optimal timing for CX3CR1 antagonism is after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

Importantly, T-regulatory cell expansion was preceded by a 12-fold spike in lamina propria CD11b<sup>+</sup> cell numbers between days 0-4; suggesting a link between the myeloid compartment and the T-regulatory cells.

More recently, others have established that subsets of memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can be classified based on their surface expression of CX3CR1; the specific receptor for the inflammatory chemokine fractalkine. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing intermediate levels (CX3CR1<sup>INT</sup>) are defined as peripheral memory, those expressing the highest levels (CX3CR1<sup>HI</sup>) are effector memory/terminally differentiated and those lacking CX3CR1 (CX3CR1<sup>NEG</sup>) are classified as central memory. To date, the fractalkine:CX3CR1 axis has not been examined in the context of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell enrichment in the omentum and here we examine this chemokines involvement in the accumulation of memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the omentum of EAC patients. Our data show that fractalkine is significantly enriched in the omentum of EAC patients and drives migration of T cells derived from EAC patient blood. Furthermore, CX3CR1 is endocytosed specifically by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells upon encountering fractalkine, which is consistent with the significantly diminished frequencies of CX3CR1<sup>INT</sup> and CX3CR1<sup>HI</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the fractalkine-rich environment of omentum in EAC, relative to matched blood. Fractalkine-mediated endocytosis of CX3CR1 by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is sustained and is followed by enhanced surface expression of L-selectin (CD62L). These novel data align with our findings that circulating CX3CR1<sup>NEG</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells express higher levels of L-selectin than CX3CR1<sup>INT</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This is consistent with previous reports and implicates fractalkine in the conversion of CX3CR1<sup>INT</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to a CX3CR1<sup>NEG</sup> phenotype characterized by alterations in the migratory capacity of these T cells.

In studies on M&#x3a6; and DC development, OC development is generally not addressed. Furthermore, findings on DC development are confusing, because monocytes can also differentiate into DC-like cells. To resolve these issues, we have examined the development of monocytes/M&#x3a6;s, OCs, and DCs from common progenitors, using the homeostatic driver cytokines macrophage colony-stimulating factor, RANK ligand (L), and Flt3L. In mouse bone marrow, B220<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>low/-</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup>c-Fms<sup>+</sup> cells could be dissected into a CD27<sup>+</sup>Flt3<sup>+</sup> population that proved oligopotent for M&#x3a6;/OC/DC development (MODP) and a CD27<sup>low/-</sup>Flt3<sup>-</sup> population that proved bipotent for M&#x3a6;/OC development (MOP).

Though studies have gradually revealed the protumorigenic functions of MDSCs, the molecular mechanisms guiding MDSC recruitment remain largely elusive. Hypoxia, O2 deprivation, is an important factor in the tumor microenvironment of solid cancers, whose growth often exceeds the growth of functional blood vessels. Here, using hepatocellular carcinoma as the cancer model, we show that hypoxia is an important driver of MDSC recruitment. We observed that MDSCs preferentially infiltrate into hypoxic regions in human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and that hypoxia-induced MDSC infiltration is dependent on hypoxia-inducible factors. We further found that hypoxia-inducible factors activate the transcription of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 26 in cancer cells to recruit chemokine (C-X3-C motif) receptor 1-expressing MDSCs to the primary tumor. Knockdown of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 26 in cancer cells profoundly reduces MDSC recruitment, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. Therapeutically, blockade of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 26 production in cancer cells by the hypoxia-inducible factor inhibitor digoxin or blockade of chemokine (C-X3-C motif) receptor 1 in MDSCs by chemokine (C-X3-C motif) receptor 1 neutralizing antibody could substantially suppress MDSC recruitment and tumor growth. This study unprecedentedly reveals a novel molecular mechanism by which cancer cells direct MDSC homing to primary tumor and suggests that targeting MDSC recruitment represents an attractive therapeutic approach against solid cancers.

Previous studies from our laboratory have used Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) genetically engineered mice to characterize the role of stromal cells and signals to optic glioma formation and growth. Previously, we have shown that Nf1+/- microglia in the tumor microenvironment are critical cellular determinants of optic glioma proliferation. To define the role of microglia in tumor formation and maintenance further, we used CD11b-TK mice, in which resident brain microglia (CD11b+, CD68+, Iba1+, CD45low cells) can be ablated at specific times after ganciclovir administration. Ganciclovir-mediated microglia reduction reduced Nf1 optic glioma proliferation during both tumor maintenance and tumor development. We identified the developmental window during which microglia are increased in the Nf1+/- optic nerve and demonstrated that this accumulation reflected delayed microglia dispersion. The increase in microglia in the Nf1+/- optic nerve was associated with reduced expression of the chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, such that reduced Cx3cr1 expression in Cx3cr1-GFP heterozygous knockout mice led to a similar increase in optic nerve microglia. These results establish a critical role for microglia in the development and maintenance of Nf1 optic glioma.",2011,"Animals; CD11 Antigens; CX3C Chemokine Receptor 1; Cell Proliferation; Down-Regulation; Genetic Carrier Screening; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Transgenic; Microglia; Neurofibromatosis 1; Optic Nerve Glioma; Receptors, Chemokine; Time Factors; Up-Regulation",7

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of metastatic disease are yet to be determined. Differentially expressed in FDCP 6 homolog (DEF6) has been demonstrated to be correlated with the metastatic behavior of several cancers, such as breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers. However, the role of DEF6 in OS remains unknown. Accordingly, the current study aimed to investigate the relationship between DEF6 expression and the malignant behavior of OS. The results revealed that high levels of DEF6 in OS tissues were associated with advanced clinical stage and metastases. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry results predicted a poor prognosis in 58 human OS specimens. Additionally, DEF6 expression was reported to be upregulated in human OS cell lines compared with a normal osteoblast cell line. small interfering RNA transfection, cell proliferation and colony formation assays, wound healing assays and Transwell assays were performed. DEF6 was not identified to be a major driver of OS cell proliferation, but it significantly contributed to metastatic potential <i>in vitro</i>. In addition, bioinformatics, western blotting and immunohistochemistry results indicated that MMP9 expression was positively correlated with DEF6 expression in human OS. To summarize, the results revealed that increased levels of DEF6 were associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in human OS and that DEF6 expression is positively correlated with MMP9 expression. The results indicated that DEF6 may serve as a potential antimetastatic target for OS.",2020,differentially expressed in FDCP 6 homolog; matrix metallopeptidase P9; metastasis; osteosarcoma,1

We aimed to build a prognostic signature by exploring the expression pattern of macrophage phenotypic switch related genes (MRGs) in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)-Pancreas, and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. We identified the differentially expressed genes between the PAAD and normal tissues. We used single factor Cox proportional risk regression analysis, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) analysis, and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis to establish the prognosis risk score by the MRGs. The relationships between the risk score and immune landscape, ""key driver"" mutations and clinicopathological factors were also analyzed. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analysis was also performed. We detected 198 differentially expressed MRGs. The risk score was constructed based on 9 genes (KIF23, BIN1, LAPTM4A, ERAP2, ATP8B2, FAM118A, RGS16, ELMO1, RAPGEFL1). The median overall survival time of patients in the low-risk group was significantly longer than that of patients in the high-risk group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). The prognostic value of the risk score was validated in GSE62452 dataset. The prognostic performance of nomogram based on risk score was superior to that of TNM stage. And GSEA analysis also showed that the risk score was closely related with P53 signaling pathway, pancreatic cancer and T cell receptor signaling pathway. qRT-PCR assay showed that the expressions of the 9 MRGs in PDAC cell lines were higher than those in human pancreatic ductal epithelium cell line. The nine gene risk score could be used as an independent prognostic index for PAAD patients.

Analyzing the transcriptome of MAPK inhibitor sensitive- and resistant-melanoma, we discovered that APAF-1 is negatively regulated by MITF in resistant tumors. This study identifies the MITF/APAF-1 axis as a molecular driver of MAPK inhibitor resistance. A drug-repositioning screen identified quinacrine and methylbenzethonium as potent activators of apoptosis in a context that mimics drug resistance mediated by APAF-1 inactivation. The compounds showed anti-tumor activity in in&#xa0;vitro and in&#xa0;vivo models, linked to suppression of MITF function. Both drugs profoundly sensitize melanoma cells to MAPK inhibitors, regulating key signaling networks in melanoma, including the MITF/APAF-1 axis. Significant activity of the two compounds in inhibiting specific epigenetic modulators of MITF/APAF-1 expression, such as histone deacetylases, was observed. In summary, we demonstrate that targeting the MITF/APAF-1 axis may overcome resistance and could be exploited as a potential therapeutic approach to treat resistant melanoma.",2022,"CP: Cancer; melanoma drug resistance, MAPK inhibitors, drug repositioning, MITF, APAF-1, epigenetic drugs, apoptosome, drug repositioning, apoptosome-independent cell death; Humans; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Melanoma; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Salvage Therapy",49

Despite their relevance in GIST oncogenesis, critical intermediates mediating the KIT/PDGFRA transforming program remain mostly unknown. Previously, we found that the adaptor molecule SH3BP2 was involved in GIST cell survival, likely due to the co-regulation of the expression of KIT and Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Remarkably, MITF reconstitution restored KIT expression levels in SH3BP2 silenced cells and restored cell viability. This study aimed to analyze MITF as a novel driver of KIT transforming program in GIST. Firstly, MITF isoforms were characterized in GIST cell lines and GIST patients' samples. MITF silencing decreases cell viability and increases apoptosis in GIST cell lines irrespective of the type of KIT primary or secondary mutation. Additionally, MITF silencing leads to cell cycle arrest and impaired tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, MITF silencing also affects ETV1 expression, a linage survival factor in GIST that promotes tumorigenesis and is directly regulated by KIT signaling. Altogether, these results point to MITF as a key target of KIT/PDGFRA oncogenic signaling for GIST survival and tumor growth.",2023,"Humans; Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Signal Transduction; Mutation; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit",49

The landscapes of their genomic alterations remain to be fully characterized. We compiled sequencing data of 240 human acral and mucosal melanoma samples from 11 previously published studies and applied a uniform pipeline to call tumor cell content, ploidy, somatic and germline mutations, as well as CNVs, LOH, and SVs. We identified genes that are significantly mutated or recurrently affected by CNVs and implicated in oncogenesis. We further examined the difference in the frequency of recurrent pathogenic alterations between the two melanoma subtypes, correlation between pathogenic alterations, and their association with clinical features. We nominated PTPRJ, mutated and homozygously deleted in 3.8% (9/240) and 0.8% (2/240) of samples, respectively, as a probable tumor suppressor gene, and FER and SKP2, amplified in 3.8% and 11.7% of samples, respectively, as probable oncogenes. We further identified a long tail of infrequent pathogenic alterations, involving genes such as CIC and LZTR1. Pathogenic germline mutations were observed on MITF, PTEN, ATM, and PRKN. We found BRAF V600E mutations in acral melanomas with fewer structural variations, suggesting that they are distinct and related to cutaneous melanomas. Amplifications of PAK1 and GAB2 were more commonly observed in acral melanomas, whereas SF3B1 R625 codon mutations were unique to mucosal melanomas (12.9%). Amplifications at 11q13-14 were frequently accompanied by fusion to a region on chromosome 6q12, revealing a recurrent novel structural rearrangement whose role remains to be elucidated.

The lack of representative mucosal melanoma models, especially cell lines, has hindered translational research on this melanoma subtype. In this study, we aimed to establish and provide the biological properties, genomic features and the pharmacological profiles of a mucosal melanoma cell line that would contribute to the understanding and treatment optimization of molecularly-defined mucosal melanoma subtype. The sample was collected from a 67-year-old mucosal melanoma patient and processed into pieces for the establishment of cell line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. The proliferation and tumorigenic property of cancer cells from different passages were evaluated, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on the original tumor, PDX, established cell line, and the matched blood to confirm the establishment and define the genomic features of this cell line. AmpliconArchitect was conducted to depict the architecture of amplified regions detected by WGS. High-throughput drug screening (HTDS) assay including a total of 103 therapeutic agents was implemented on the established cell line, and selected candidate agents were validated in the corresponding PDX model. A mucosal melanoma cell line, MM9H-1, was established which exhibited robust proliferation and tumorigenicity after more than 100 serial passages. Genomic analysis of MM9H-1, corresponding PDX, and the original tumor showed genetic fidelity across genomes, and MM9H-1 was defined as a triple wild-type (TWT) melanoma subtype lacking well-characterized ""driver mutations"". Instead, the amplification of several oncogenes, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), melanocyte Inducing transcription factor (MITF) and INO80 complex ATPase subunit (INO80), via large-scale genomic rearrangement potentially contributed to oncogenesis of MM9H-1. Moreover, HTDS identified proteasome inhibitors, especially bortezomib, as promising therapeutic candidates for MM9H-1, which was verified in the corresponding PDX model in vivo. We established and characterized a new mucosal melanoma cell line, MM9H-1, and defined this cell line as a TWT melanoma subtype lacking well-characterized ""driver mutations"".

The melanocytic master transcriptional regulator, MITF, is essential for both CM development and maintenance, but its role in UM is largely unexplored. Here, we use zebrafish models to dissect the key UM oncogenic signaling events and establish the role of MITF in UM tumors. Using a melanocytic lineage expression system, we showed that patient-derived mutations of GNAQ (GNAQQ209L) or its upstream CYSLTR2 receptor (CYSLTR2L129Q) both drive UM when combined with a cooperating mutation, tp53M214K/M214K. The tumor-initiating potential of the major GNAQ/11 effector pathways, YAP, and phospholipase C-&#x3b2; (PLC&#x3b2;)&#x2013;ERK was also investigated in this system and thus showed that while activated YAP (YAPAA) induced UM with high potency, the patient-derived PLC&#x3b2;4 mutation (PLCB4D630Y) very rarely yielded UM tumors in the tp53M214K/M214K context. Remarkably, mitfa deficiency was profoundly UM promoting, dramatically accelerating the onset and progression of tumors induced by Tg(mitfa:GNAQQ209L);tp53M214K/M214K or Tg(mitfa:CYSLTR2L129Q);tp53M214K/M214K. Moreover, mitfa loss was sufficient to cooperate with GNAQQ209L to drive tp53&#x2013;wild type UM development and allowed Tg(mitfa:PLCB4D630Y);tp53M214K/M214K melanocyte lineage cells to readily form tumors.

In melanoma, a regulatory axis between the MITF and BRN2 transcription factors has been reported to promote tumor heterogeneity by mediating switching between proliferative and invasive phenotypes, respectively. Despite strong evidence that subpopulations of cells that exhibit a BRN2<sup>high</sup>/MITF<sup>low</sup> expression profile switch to a predominantly invasive phenotype, the mechanisms by which this switch is propagated and promotes invasion remain poorly defined. We have found that a reciprocal relationship between BRN2 and NOTCH1/2 signaling exists in melanoma cells in&#xa0;vitro, within patient datasets, and in in&#xa0;vivo primary and metastatic human tumors that bolsters acquisition of invasiveness. Working through the epigenetic modulator EZH2, the BRN2&#x2012;NOTCH1/2 axis is potentially a key mechanism by which the invasive phenotype is maintained. Given the emergence of agents targeting both EZH2 and NOTCH, understanding the mechanism through which BRN2 promotes heterogeneity may provide crucial biomarkers to predict treatment response to prevent metastasis.",2022,"Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Melanoma; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Neoplasm Invasiveness; POU Domain Factors; Receptor, Notch1; Receptor, Notch2",49

The POU domain transcription factor BRN2 is a key regulator of melanoma invasion, yet its role in melanoma initiation remains unknown. Here, in a Braf<sup>V600E</sup> Pten<sup>F/+</sup> context, we show that BRN2 haplo-insufficiency promotes melanoma initiation and metastasis. However, metastatic colonization is less efficient in the absence of Brn2. Mechanistically, BRN2 directly induces PTEN expression and in consequence represses PI3K signaling. Moreover, MITF, a BRN2 target, represses PTEN transcription.

In this study, we applied machine learning algorithms to infer the trajectories of cellular changes and identify their transcriptional programs. Our study generated cellular trajectories that show the COVID-19 pathogenesis of healthy-to-moderate and healthy-to-severe on macrophages and T cells, and we observed more diverse trajectories in macrophages compared to T cells. Furthermore, our deep-learning algorithm DrivAER identified several pathways (e.g., xenobiotic pathway and complement pathway) and transcription factors (e.g., MITF and GATA3) that could be potential drivers of the transcriptomic changes for COVID-19 pathogenesis and the markers of the COVID-19 severity.

An emerging approach in cancer immunology involves the conditional induction of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), which are non-encapsulated ectopic lymphoid structures forming at sites of chronic, pathologic inflammation. Cutaneous melanoma (CM), a highly-immunogenic form of solid cancer, continues to rise in both incidence and mortality rate, with recent reports supporting a positive correlation between the presence of TLS in melanoma and beneficial treatment outcomes amongst advanced-stage patients. In this context, TLS in CM are postulated to serve as dynamic centers for the initiation of robust anti-tumor responses within affected regions of active disease. Given their potential importance to patient outcome, significant effort has been recently devoted to gaining a better understanding of TLS neogenesis and the influence these lymphoid organs exert within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we briefly review TLS structure, function, and response to treatment in the setting of CM. To uncover potential tumor-intrinsic mechanisms that regulate TLS formation, we have taken the novel perspective of evaluating TLS induction in melanomas impacted by common driver mutations in BRAF, PTEN, NRAS, KIT, PRDM1, and MITF. Through analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we show expression of DNA repair proteins (DRPs) including BRCA1, PAXIP, ERCC1, ERCC2, ERCC3, MSH2, and PMS2 to be negatively correlated with expression of pro-TLS genes, suggesting DRP loss may favor TLS development in support of improved patient outcome and patient response to interventional immunotherapy.",2021,"DNA repair proteins; cutaneous melanoma; driver mutations; tertiary lymphoid structures; tumor mutational burden; Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; Humans; Immunotherapy; Melanoma; Mutation; Prognosis; Skin Neoplasms; Tertiary Lymphoid Structures; Tumor Microenvironment",49

To date, there has been no comprehensive systematic collation and statistical analysis of the aberrations and aggregated frequency of driver events across multiple studies. Published studies using whole genome, whole exome, targeted gene panel, or individual gene sequencing were identified. Datasets from these studies were collated to summarize mutations, structural variants, and regions of copy-number alteration. Studies using next-generation sequencing were divided into the ""main"" cohort (<i>n</i> = 173; fresh-frozen samples), ""validation"" cohort (<i>n</i> = 48; formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples) and a second ""validation"" cohort comprised 104 tumors sequenced using a targeted panel. Studies assessing mutations in <i>BRAF, KIT</i>, and <i>NRAS</i> were summarized to assess hotspot mutations. Statistical analysis of the main cohort variant data revealed <i>KIT, NF1, BRAF, NRAS, SF3B1</i>, and <i>SPRED1</i> as significantly mutated genes. <i>ATRX</i> and <i>SF3B1</i> mutations occurred more commonly in lower anatomy melanomas and <i>CTNNB1</i> in the upper anatomy. <i>NF1, PTEN, CDKN2A, SPRED1, ATM, CHEK2</i>, and <i>ARID1B</i> were commonly affected by chromosomal copy loss, while <i>TERT, KIT, BRAF, YAP1, CDK4, CCND1, GAB2, MDM2, SKP2</i>, and <i>MITF</i> were commonly amplified.

To test whether transcriptional adaptation can drive melanoma progression, we made use of a zebrafish mitfa:<i>BRAFV600E</i>;<i>tp53-/-</i> model, in which malignant progression is characterized by minimal genetic evolution. We undertook an overexpression-screen of 80 epigenetic/transcriptional regulators and found neural crest-mesenchyme developmental regulator SATB2 to accelerate aggressive melanoma development. Its overexpression induces invadopodia formation and invasion in zebrafish tumors and human melanoma cell lines. SATB2 binds and activates neural crest-regulators, including <i>pdgfab</i> and <i>snai2</i>. The transcriptional program induced by SATB2 overlaps with known MITF<sup>low</sup>AXL<sup>high</sup> and AQP1<sup>+</sup>NGFR1<sup>high</sup> drug-resistant states and functionally drives enhanced tumor propagation and resistance to Vemurafenib in vivo.

Here, we tested the impact of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) on melanoma progression in association with melanocyte inducing transcription factor (MITF) expression levels. We established a mouse melanoma model for deleting Stat3 in melanocytes with specific expression of human hyperactive NRAS<sup>Q61K</sup> in an Ink4a-deficient background, two frequent driver mutations in human melanoma. Mice devoid of Stat3 showed early disease onset with higher proliferation in primary tumors, but displayed significantly diminished lung, brain, and liver metastases. Whole-genome expression profiling of tumor-derived cells also showed a reduced invasion phenotype, which was further corroborated by 3D melanoma model analysis. Notably, loss or knockdown of STAT3 in mouse or human cells resulted in the upregulation of MITF and induction of cell proliferation. Mechanistically we show that STAT3-induced CAAT Box Enhancer Binding Protein (CEBP) expression was sufficient to suppress MITF transcription. Epigenetic analysis by ATAC-seq confirmed that CEBPa/b binding to the MITF enhancer region silenced the MITF locus. Finally, by classification of patient-derived melanoma samples, we show that STAT3 and MITF act antagonistically and hence contribute differentially to melanoma progression. We conclude that STAT3 is a driver of the metastatic process in melanoma and able to antagonize MITF via direct induction of CEBP family member transcription.",2021,"Animals; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Melanocytes; Melanoma; Mice; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Neoplasm Metastasis; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Signal Transduction",49

Cytogenetic translocations involving TFE3 and TFEB are now well described in multiple tumor types, but there has been little evidence to suggest similar regulation of MITF. Here we describe a series of 7 clear cell cutaneous neoplasms with melanocytic differentiation that are characterized by ACTIN-MITF gene fusions, either ACTB-MITF or ACTG1-MITF. The chromosomal breakpoints preserve MITF's dimerization and transcriptional activation domains, suggesting that these fusion proteins likely result in hyperactive MITF function, analogously to the previously reported TFE3 and TFEB fusions.

Biallelic loss of TSC1 or TSC2 is a known genetic driver of angiomyolipoma development, however, whether an altered transcriptional repertoire contributes to TSC-associated tumorigenesis is unknown. RNA-seq analyses showed that MITF A isoform (MITF-A) was consistently highly expressed in angiomyolipoma, immunohistochemistry showed microphthalmia-associated transcription factor nuclear localization, and Chromatin immuno-Precipitation Sequencing analysis showed that the MITF-A transcriptional start site was highly enriched with H3K27ac marks. Using the angiomyolipoma cell line 621-101, MITF knockout (MITF.KO) and MITF-A overexpressing (MITF.OE) cell lines were generated. MITF.KO cells showed markedly reduced growth and invasion in vitro, and were unable to form xenografted tumors. In contrast, MITF.OE cells grew faster in vitro and as xenografted tumors compared to control cells. RNA-Seq analysis showed that both ID2 and Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61) expression levels were increased in the MITF.OE cells and reduced in the MITF.KO cells, and luciferase assays showed this was due to transcriptional effects. Importantly, CYR61 overexpression rescued MITF.KO cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.

32796736,MITF,10.3390/cancers12082248,Intrinsic Balance between ZEB Family Members Is Important for Melanocyte Homeostasis and Melanoma Progression.,"It has become clear that cellular plasticity is a main driver of cancer therapy resistance. Consequently, there is a need to mechanistically identify the factors driving this process. The transcription factors of the zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox family, consisting of ZEB1 and ZEB2, are notorious for their roles in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, in melanoma, an intrinsic balance between ZEB1 and ZEB2 seems to determine the cellular state by modulating the expression of the master regulator of melanocyte homeostasis, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). ZEB2 drives MITF expression and is associated with a differentiated/proliferative melanoma cell state. On the other hand, ZEB1 is correlated with low MITF expression and a more invasive, stem cell-like and therapy-resistant cell state. This intrinsic balance between ZEB1 and ZEB2 could prove to be a promising therapeutic target for melanoma patients. In this review, we will summarise what is known on the functional mechanisms of these transcription factors. Moreover, we will look specifically at their roles during melanocyte-lineage development and homeostasis. Finally, we will overview the current literature on ZEB1 and ZEB2 in the melanoma context and link this to the 'phenotype-switching' model of melanoma cellular plasticity.",2020,ZEB transcription factors; cellular plasticity; melanocyte development and homeostasis; melanoma; phenotype switching; tumour heterogeneity,49
32092380,MITF,10.1016/j.addr.2020.02.002,Topical treatment strategies to manipulate human skin pigmentation.,"Skin pigmentation is a result of melanin produced by melanocytes in the epidermis. Melanocyte activity, along with the type and distribution of melanins, is the main driver for diversity of skin pigmentation. Dark melanin acts to protect against the deleterious effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, including photo-aging and skin cancer formation. In turn, UV radiation activates skin melanocytes to induce further pigmentation (i.e., ""tanning pathway""). The well-characterized MSH/MC1R-cAMP-MITF pathway regulates UV-induced melanization. Pharmacologic activation of this pathway (""sunless tanning"") represents a potential strategy for skin cancer prevention, particularly in those with light skin or the ""red hair"" phenotype who tan poorly after UV exposure due to MC1R inactivating polymorphisms. Skin hyperpigmentation can also occur as a result of inflammatory processes and dermatological disorders such as melasma. While primarily of cosmetic concern, these conditions can dramatically impact quality of life of affected patients. Several topical agents are utilized to treat skin pigmentation disorders. Here, we review melanogenesis induced by UV exposure and the agents that target this pathway.",2021,"MITF; Melanocytes; Pigmentation; cAMP; Administration, Cutaneous; Cyclic AMP; Dermatologic Agents; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Melanins; Pigmentation Disorders; Protein Kinases; Skin Pigmentation; Ultraviolet Rays",49

How metabolism is implicated in specific phenotypes and whether lineage-restricted mechanisms control key metabolic vulnerabilities remain poorly understood. In melanoma, downregulation of the lineage addiction oncogene microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a hallmark of the proliferative-to-invasive phenotype switch, although how MITF promotes proliferation and suppresses invasion is poorly defined. Here, we show that MITF is a lineage-restricted activator of the key lipogenic enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and that SCD is required for MITF<sup>High</sup> melanoma cell proliferation. By contrast MITF<sup>Low</sup> cells are insensitive to SCD inhibition. Significantly, the MITF-SCD axis suppresses metastasis, inflammatory signaling, and an ATF4-mediated feedback loop that maintains de-differentiation. Our results reveal that MITF is a lineage-specific regulator of metabolic reprogramming, whereby fatty acid composition is a driver of melanoma phenotype switching, and highlight that cell phenotype dictates the response to drugs targeting lipid metabolism.",2020,"ATF4; MITF; fatty acid saturation; melanoma; metastatic dissemination; phenotype switching; stearoyl CoA desaturase; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Down-Regulation; Fatty Acids; Humans; Melanoma; Mice; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Phenotype; Signal Transduction; Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase",49

Like other non-epithelial melanocytic lesions, they bear frequent oncogenic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits, GNAQ or GNA11. In this study, we used Plp1-creERT to force the expression of oncogenic GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> in the multipotent neural crest cells of the ventro-medial developmental pathway, beginning prior to melanocyte cell differentiation. We found that this produces leptomeningeal melanocytic neoplasms, including cranial melanocytomas, spinal melanocytomas, and spinal melanomas, in addition to blue nevus-like lesions in the dermis. GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> drove different phenotypes depending upon when during embryogenesis (E9.5, E10.5, or E11.5) it was induced by tamoxifen and which Cre driver (Plp1-creERT, Tyr-creERT<sup>2</sup> , or Mitf-cre) was used. Given these differences, we propose that melanocytes go through temporary phases where they become sensitive to the oncogenic effects of GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> .

When malignant tumours develop distant metastatic lesions the new local tissue niche is known to impact on the biology of the cancer cells. However, little is known about how different metastatic tissue sites impact on frontline targeted therapies. Intriguingly, melanoma bone lesions have significantly lower response to BRAF or MEK inhibitor therapies. Here, we have investigated how the cellular niche of the bone can support melanoma cells by stimulating growth and survival via paracrine signalling between osteoblasts and cancer cells. Melanoma cells can enhance the differentiation of osteoblasts leading to increased production of secreted ligands, including RANKL. Differentiated osteoblasts in turn can support melanoma cell proliferation and survival via the secretion of RANKL that elevates the levels of the transcription factor MITF, even in the presence of BRAF inhibitor. By blocking RANKL signalling, either via neutralizing antibodies, genetic alterations or the RANKL receptor inhibitor SPD304, the survival advantage provided by osteoblasts could be overcome.",2020,"BRAF; MITF; Osteoblasts; RANKL; melanoma; resistance; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Melanoma; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Osteoblasts; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; RANK Ligand; Signal Transduction",49

Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine a possible association between the C-KIT immunohistochemical expression with the presence of somatic driver mutations in NRAS, BRAF, KIT, MITF and PTEN on POSNM. A retrospective study included 62 tumour samples of an oncological reference centre in Mexico City (17-year period). Immunohistochemistry stain of C-KIT was carried out. Genomic DNA was obtained and used to assess hotspot mutations of KIT, NRAS, BRAF, MITF and PTEN through qPCR. Chi-square, Fisher's exact and the Mann-Whitney U tests were applied when necessary. The significance was set at P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05. Sixty-two cases were included, 74% were positive for C-KIT immunoexpression, all exhibited moderate/strong intensity.

In this NGS analysis of the HBL tumor, 67 variants of 41 genes were identified.&#xa0;Of these, 64 were single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), two were&#xa0;exonic insertions and deletions (INDEL), and one was an intronic INDEL. In total, 15 were missense exonic&#xa0;variants, including an insertion variant in the <i>NRAS</i> gene, c.1_2insA, and a deletion variant,&#xa0;c.745delT, in the&#xa0;<i>HNF1A</i> gene, both of these mutations&#xa0;produced a termination codon. Other exonic missense variants found in&#xa0;the tumor were <i>CTNNB1</i>, <i>FGFR3</i>, <i>KDR</i>, <i>SMO</i>, <i>HRAS</i>, <i>RAI1</i>, and a <i>TP53</i> variant (c.430C&gt;G). Moreover, the&#xa0;results of the present study revealed a novel variant, c.430C&gt;G, in <i>TP53</i> and two missense variants of <i>SND1&#xa0;</i>(c.1810G&gt;C and c.1814G&gt;C), which were also novel. <i>ALK</i> (rs760315884) and <i>FGFR2</i> (rs1042522) missense&#xa0;variants were reported previously. Notably, a total of 10 previously reported single-nucleotide&#xa0;polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in this tumor in genes including&#xa0;<i>MLH1&#xa0;</i>(rs769364808), <i>FGFR3&#xa0;</i>(rs769364808), two variants (rs1873778 and rs2228230) in <i>PDGFRA</i>, <i>KIT</i> (rs55986963), <i>APC&#xa0;</i>(rs41115), and&#xa0;<i>RET</i> (rs1800861).

The TGCT histopathology is diverse, and the frequency of genomic alterations, along with their prognostic role, remains largely unexplored. Herein, we evaluate the mutation profile of a 15-driver gene panel and copy number variation of <i>KRAS</i> in a large series of TGCT from a single reference cancer center. A cohort of 97 patients with TGCT, diagnosed at the Barretos Cancer Hospital, was evaluated. Real-time PCR was used to assess copy number variation (CNV) of the <i>KRAS</i> gene in 51 cases, and the mutation analysis was performed using the TruSight Tumor 15 (Illumina) panel (TST15) in 65 patients. Univariate analysis was used to compare sample categories in relation to mutational frequencies. Survival analysis was conducted by the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. <i>KRAS</i> copy number gain was a very frequent event (80.4%) in TGCT and presented a worse prognosis compared with the group with no <i>KRAS</i> copy gain (10y-OS, 90% <i>vs</i>. 81.5%, p = 0.048). Among the 65 TGCT cases, different variants were identified in 11 of 15 genes of the panel, and the <i>TP53</i> gene was the most recurrently mutated driver gene (27.7%). Variants were also detected in genes such as <i>KIT</i>, <i>KRAS, PDGFRA</i>, <i>EGFR</i>, <i>BRAF</i>, <i>RET</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, <i>PIK3CA</i>, <i>MET</i>, and <i>ERBB2</i>, with some of them potentially targetable.

They are by far the most common soft tissue sarcomas. Clinically, they present as gastrointestinal malignancies, most often with bleeding, pain, or intestinal obstruction. They are identified using characteristic immunohistochemical staining for CD117 and DOG1. Improved understanding of the molecular biology of these tumors and identification of oncogenic drivers have altered the systemic treatment of primarily disseminated disease, which is becoming increasingly complex. Gain-of-function mutations in <i>KIT</i> or <i>PDGFRA</i> genes represent the driving mutations in more than 90% of all GISTs. These patients exhibit good responses to targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Gastrointestinal stromal tumors lacking the <i>KIT/PDGFRA</i> mutations, however, represent distinct clinico-pathological entities with diverse molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis. In these patients, therapy with TKIs is hardly ever as effective as for <i>KIT/PDGFRA</i>-mutated GISTs. This review provides an outline of current diagnostics aimed at identifying clinically relevant driver alterations and a comprehensive summary of current treatments with targeted therapies for patients with GISTs in both adjuvant and metastatic settings. The role of molecular testing and the selection of the optimal targeted therapy according to the identified oncogenic driver are reviewed and some future directions are proposed.",2023,GIST; KIT; PDGFRA; mutations; targeted therapy,147

It remains elusive whether the specific states of neural cell lineages are differentially susceptible to distinct genetic alterations during malignant transformation. Here, an analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas databases revealed that comutations of PTEN and TP53 are most significantly enriched in human high-grade gliomas. Therefore, we selectively ablated Pten and Trp53 in different progenitors to determine which cell lineage states are susceptible to malignant transformation. Mice with PTEN/p53 ablation mediated by multilineage-expressing human GFAP (hGFAP) promoter-driven Cre developed glioma but with incomplete penetrance and long latency. Unexpectedly, ablation of Pten and Trp53 in Nestin+ neural stem cells (NSC) or Pdgfra+/NG2+ committed oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC), two major cells of origin in glioma, did not induce glioma formation in mice. Strikingly, mice lacking Pten and Trp53 in Olig1+/Olig2+ intermediate precursors (pri-OPC) prior to the committed OPCs developed high-grade gliomas with 100% penetrance and short latency. The resulting tumors exhibited distinct tumor phenotypes and drug sensitivities from NSC- or OPC-derived glioma subtypes. Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses revealed that PTEN/p53-loss induced activation of oncogenic pathways, including HIPPO-YAP and PI3K signaling, to promote malignant transformation. Targeting the core regulatory circuitries YAP and PI3K signaling effectively inhibited tumor cell growth. Thus, our multicell state in vivo mutagenesis analyses suggests that transit-amplifying states of Olig1/2 intermediate lineage precursors are predisposed to PTEN/p53-loss-induced transformation and gliomagenesis, pointing to subtype-specific treatment strategies for gliomas with distinct genetic alterations. Multiple progenitor-state mutagenesis reveal that Olig1/2-expressing intermediate precursors are highly susceptible to PTEN/p53-loss-mediated transformation and impart differential drug sensitivity, indicating tumor-initiating cell states and genetic drivers dictate glioma phenotypes and drug responses.

Elderly patients show increased frequencies of IDH mutations with high chemoresistance and relapse rates despite recent therapeutic advances. Besides being associated with global promoter hypermethylation, IDH1 mutation facilitated changes in 3D DNA-conformation by CTCF-anchor methylation and upregulated oncogene expression in glioma, correlating with poor prognosis. Here, we investigated the role of IDH1 p.R132H mutation in altering 3D DNA-architecture and subsequent oncogene activation in AML. Using public RNA-Seq data, we identified upregulation of tyrosine kinase PDGFRA in IDH1-mutant patients, correlating with poor prognosis. DNA methylation analysis identified CpG hypermethylation within a CTCF-anchor upstream of PDGFRA in IDH1-mutant patients. Increased PDGFRA expression, PDGFRA-CTCF methylation and decreased CTCF binding were confirmed in AML CRISPR cells with heterozygous IDH1 p.R132H mutation and upon exogenous 2-HG treatment. IDH1-mutant cells showed higher sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib, which was supported by reduced blast count in a patient with refractory IDH1-mutant AML after dasatinib treatment. Our data illustrate that IDH1 p.R132H mutation leads to CTCF hypermethylation, disrupting DNA-looping and insulation of PDGFRA, resulting in PDGFRA upregulation in IDH1-mutant AML.

Despite their relevance in GIST oncogenesis, critical intermediates mediating the KIT/PDGFRA transforming program remain mostly unknown. Previously, we found that the adaptor molecule SH3BP2 was involved in GIST cell survival, likely due to the co-regulation of the expression of KIT and Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Remarkably, MITF reconstitution restored KIT expression levels in SH3BP2 silenced cells and restored cell viability. This study aimed to analyze MITF as a novel driver of KIT transforming program in GIST. Firstly, MITF isoforms were characterized in GIST cell lines and GIST patients' samples. MITF silencing decreases cell viability and increases apoptosis in GIST cell lines irrespective of the type of KIT primary or secondary mutation. Additionally, MITF silencing leads to cell cycle arrest and impaired tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, MITF silencing also affects ETV1 expression, a linage survival factor in GIST that promotes tumorigenesis and is directly regulated by KIT signaling. Altogether, these results point to MITF as a key target of KIT/PDGFRA oncogenic signaling for GIST survival and tumor growth.",2023,"Humans; Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Signal Transduction; Mutation; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit",147

Prior in situ profiling studies of human CAFs have largely relied on scoring single markers, thus presenting a limited view of their molecular complexity. Our objective was to study the complex spatial tumor microenvironment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with multiple CAF biomarkers, identify novel CAF subsets, and explore their associations with patient outcome. Multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry was employed to spatially profile the CAF landscape in 2 population-based NSCLC cohorts (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;636) using antibodies against 4 fibroblast markers: platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA) and -beta (PDGFRB), fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#x3b1;SMA). The CAF subsets were analyzed for their correlations with mutations, immune characteristics, and clinical variables as well as overall survival. Two CAF subsets, CAF7 (PDGFRA-/PDGFRB+/FAP+/&#x3b1;SMA+) and CAF13 (PDGFRA+/PDGFRB+/FAP-/&#x3b1;SMA+), showed statistically significant but opposite associations with tumor histology, driver mutations (tumor protein p53 [TP53] and epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]), immune features (programmed death-ligand 1 and CD163), and prognosis. In patients with early stage tumors (pathological tumor-node-metastasis IA-IB), CAF7 and CAF13 acted as independent prognostic factors. Multimarker-defined CAF subsets were identified through high-content spatial profiling. The robust associations of CAFs with driver mutations, immune features, and outcome suggest CAFs as essential factors in NSCLC progression and warrant further studies to explore their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.

Despite the clinical success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), more than half of GIST patients develop resistance due to a second mutation. Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is the catalytic subunit of CDK-activating kinase (CAK), and it plays an important role in the regulation of cell cycle transitions and gene transcription. THZ1, a CDK7 inhibitor, exhibits a dose-dependent inhibitory effect in various cancers. Data from the public GEO database and tissue microarray were used to analyse the gene expression levels of CDKs in GISTs. The impact of CDK7 knockdown and the CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 on GIST progression was investigated in vitro using CCK-8, colony formation, and flow cytometry assays and in vivo using a xenograft mouse model. RNA sequencing was performed to investigate the mechanism of GIST cell viability impairment mediated by THZ1 treatment. Our study demonstrated that CDK7 is relatively overexpressed in high-risk GISTs and predicts a poor outcome. A low concentration of THZ1 exhibited a pronounced antineoplastic effect in GIST cells in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, THZ1 exerted synergistic anticancer effects with imatinib. THZ1 treatment resulted in transcriptional modulation by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Ser2, Ser5, and Ser7 within RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). c-KIT, an oncogene driver of GIST, was transcriptionally repressed by THZ1 treatment or CDK7 knockdown. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that OSR1 acts as a downstream target of CDK7 and regulates c-KIT expression.

Accordingly, the fifth edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) CNS tumor classification was published in 2021. We analyzed 303 patients with diffuse glioma using an amplicon-based glioma-tailored gene panel for detecting 1p/19q codeletion and driver gene mutations such as IDH1/2, TERTp, EGFR, and CDKN2A/B on a single platform. Within glioblastomas (GBMs), the most commonly mutated genes were TERTp, TP53, PTEN, NF1, and PDGFRA, which was the most frequently mutated tyrosine kinase receptor in GBM, followed by EGFR. The genes that most commonly showed evidence of loss were PTEN, CDKN2A/B, and RB1, whereas the genes that most commonly showed evidence of gain/amplification were EGFR, PDGFRA, and CDK4. In 22 grade III oligodendroglial tumors, 3 (14%) patients had CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, and 4 (18%) patients had ARID1A mutation. In grade III oligodendroglial tumors, an ARID1A mutation was associated with worse progression-free survival. Reclassification based on the WHO 2021 classification resulted in 62.5% of grade II/III isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) -wildtype astrocytomas being classified as IDH-wildtype GBM and 37.5% as not elsewhere classified. In summary, our glioma-tailored gene panel was applicable for molecular diagnosis in the WHO 2021 classification. In addition, we successfully reclassified the 303 diffuse glioma cases based on the WHO 2021 classification and clarified the genetic profile of diffuse gliomas in the Japanese population.",2022,WHO 2021 classification; gene panel; molecular genetic profile; next-generation sequencing; Astrocytoma; Brain Neoplasms; ErbB Receptors; Genetic Profile; Glioma; Homozygote; Humans; Isocitrate Dehydrogenase; Japan; Molecular Biology; Mutation; Prognosis; Sequence Deletion,147

KIT or PDGFR&#x3b1; mutation plays as an oncogenic driver in the majority of GISTs. Surgical resection is the only curative treatment for localized disease. The discovery of imatinib with promising anti-tumor effect and successive tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), including second-line sunitinib and third-line regorafenib, revolutionized the management of advanced and metastatic GIST over the past two decades. Recently, ripretinib and avapritinib were approved for the fourth line setting and for PDGFRA exon 18-mutant GIST in first-line setting, respectively. Despite multi-line TKIs exerted ability of disease control, drug resistance remained an obstacle for preventing rapid disease progression. Experimental TKIs or novel therapeutic targets may further improve treatment efficacy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD1) and anti-CTL-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) showed moderate response in early phase trials composed of heavily pretreated patients. KIT/PDGFR&#x3b1; wild-type GISTs are generally less sensitive to imatinib and late-line TKIs.

Recent studies have made significant progress in better understanding diversity and conservation of reptile sex chromosomes, with however no reptile master sex determination genes identified. Here we describe an integrated genomics and cytogenetics pipeline, combining probes generated from the microdissected sex chromosomes with transcriptome and genome sequencing to explore the sex chromosome diversity in non-model Australian reptiles. We tested our pipeline on a turtle, two species of geckos, and a monitor lizard. Genes identified on sex chromosomes were compared to the chicken genome to identify homologous regions among the four species. We identified candidate sex determining genes within these regions, including conserved vertebrate sex-determining genes <i>pdgfa, pdgfra</i> <i>amh</i> and <i>wt1</i>, and demonstrated their testis or ovary-specific expression. All four species showed gene-by-gene rather than chromosome-wide dosage compensation. Our results imply that reptile sex chromosomes originated by independent acquisition of sex-determining genes on different autosomes, as well as translocations between different ancestral macro- and microchromosomes. We discuss the evolutionary drivers of the slow differentiation and turnover of reptile sex chromosomes. &#x722c;&#x884c;&#x52a8;&#x7269;&#x7684;&#x6027;&#x522b;&#x51b3;&#x5b9a;&#x4e00;&#x76f4;&#x5907;&#x53d7;&#x5173;&#x6ce8;&#xff0c;&#x5176;&#x6027;&#x522b;&#x51b3;&#x5b9a;&#x548c;&#x5242;&#x91cf;&#x8865;&#x507f;&#x673a;&#x5236;&#x7684;&#x591a;&#x6837;&#x6027;&#x662f;&#x6211;&#x4eec;&#x7406;&#x89e3;&#x590d;&#x6742;&#x7684;&#x6027;&#x67d3;&#x8272;&#x4f53;&#x8f6c;&#x6362;&#x673a;&#x5236;&#x7684;&#x7edd;&#x4f73;&#x6750;&#x6599;&#x3002;&#x8fd1;&#x5e74;&#x6765;&#xff0c;&#x5173;&#x4e8e;&#x722c;&#x884c;&#x52a8;&#x7269;&#x6027;&#x67d3;&#x8272;&#x4f53;&#x591a;&#x6837;&#x6027;&#x548c;&#x4fdd;&#x62a4;&#x7684;&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#x53d6;&#x5f97;&#x4e86;&#x4e00;&#x7cfb;&#x5217;&#x91cd;&#x8981;&#x8fdb;&#x5c55;&#xff0c;&#x4f46;&#x76ee;&#x524d;&#x722c;&#x884c;&#x52a8;&#x7269;&#x7684;&#x4e3b;&#x6548;&#x6027;&#x522b;&#x51b3;&#x5b9a;&#x57fa;&#x56e0;&#x88ab;&#x62a5;&#x9053;&#x548c;&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#x5730;&#x6781;&#x5c11;&#x3002;&#x8be5;&#x6587;&#x53d1;&#x5c55;&#x4e86;&#x4e00;&#x5957;&#x5c06;&#x57fa;&#x56e0;&#x7ec4;&#x5b66;&#x548c;&#x7ec6;&#x80de;&#x9057;&#x4f20;&#x5b66;&#x7ed3;&#x5408;&#x8d77;&#x6765;&#x7684;&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#x6027;&#x67d3;&#x8272;&#x4f53;&#x7684;&#x65b9;&#x6cd5;&#x3002;&#x6211;&#x4eec;&#x9996;&#x5148;&#x901a;&#x8fc7;&#x663e;&#x5fae;&#x89e3;&#x5256;&#x83b7;&#x5f97;&#x6027;&#x67d3;&#x8272;&#x4f53;&#x7279;&#x5f02;&#x7684;&#x63a2;&#x9488;&#xff0c;&#x518d;&#x4e0e;&#x8f6c;&#x5f55;&#x7ec4;&#x548c;&#x57fa;&#x56e0;&#x7ec4;&#x6d4b;&#x5e8f;&#x76f8;&#x7ed3;&#x5408;&#xff0c;&#x4ece;&#x800c;&#x63a2;&#x7d22;&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#x4e86;&#x591a;&#x4e2a;&#x6fb3;&#x5927;&#x5229;&#x4e9a;&#x975e;&#x6a21;&#x5f0f;&#x722c;&#x884c;&#x52a8;&#x7269;&#x7684;&#x6027;&#x67d3;&#x8272;&#x4f53;&#x591a;&#x6837;&#x6027;&#x3002;&#x6211;&#x4eec;&#x5728;&#x4e00;&#x79cd;&#x9f9f;&#x3001;&#x4e24;&#x79cd;&#x58c1;&#x864e;&#x548c;&#x4e00;&#x79cd;&#x5de8;&#x8725;&#x4e2d;&#x6d4b;&#x8bd5;&#x4e86;&#x6211;&#x4eec;&#x7684;&#x6d41;&#x7a0b;&#x3002;&#x901a;&#x8fc7;&#x5c06;&#x6027;&#x67d3;&#x8272;&#x4f53;&#x4e0a;&#x7684;&#x57fa;&#x56e0;&#x4e0e;&#x9e21;&#x7684;&#x57fa;&#x56e0;&#x7ec4;&#x76f8;&#x6bd4;&#x8f83;&#xff0c;&#x6211;&#x4eec;&#x63a8;&#x65ad;&#x4e86;&#x8fd9;&#x56db;&#x4e2a;&#x7269;&#x79cd;&#x4e0e;&#x9e21;&#x7684;&#x540c;&#x6e90;&#x7684;&#x5019;&#x9009;&#x6027;&#x522b;&#x51b3;&#x5b9a;&#x533a;&#x57df;&#x3002;&#x6211;&#x4eec;&#x5728;&#x8fd9;&#x4e9b;&#x533a;&#x57df;&#x4e2d;&#x53d1;&#x73b0;&#x4e86;&#x5019;&#x9009;&#x7684;&#x6027;&#x522b;&#x51b3;&#x5b9a;&#x57fa;&#x56e0;&#xff0c;&#x5305;&#x62ec;&#x5728;&#x810a;&#x690e;&#x52a8;&#x7269;&#x4e2d;&#x6bd4;&#x8f83;&#x4fdd;&#x5b88;&#x7684;&#x6027;&#x522b;&#x51b3;&#x5b9a;&#x57fa;&#x56e0; <i>pdgfa</i>&#x3001; <i>pdgfra&#x3001;</i> <i>amh</i>&#x548c; <i>wt1</i>&#xff0c;&#x5e76;&#x8bc1;&#x660e;&#x4e86;&#x5b83;&#x4eec;&#x5728;&#x777e;&#x4e38;&#x6216;&#x5375;&#x5de2;&#x5185;&#x5177;&#x6709;&#x7ec4;&#x7ec7;&#x7279;&#x5f02;&#x6027;&#x7684;&#x57fa;&#x56e0;&#x8868;&#x8fbe;&#x3002;&#x6240;&#x6709;&#x56db;&#x4e2a;&#x7269;&#x79cd;&#x90fd;&#x8868;&#x73b0;&#x51fa;&#x57fa;&#x56e0;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#x7684;&#x5242;&#x91cf;&#x8865;&#x507f;&#xff0c;&#x800c;&#x4e0d;&#x662f;&#x67d3;&#x8272;&#x4f53;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#x5185;&#x7684;&#x5242;&#x91cf;&#x8865;&#x507f;&#x3002;&#x6211;&#x4eec;&#x7684;&#x7ed3;&#x679c;&#x8868;&#x660e;&#xff0c;&#x722c;&#x884c;&#x52a8;&#x7269;&#x7684;&#x6027;&#x67d3;&#x8272;&#x4f53;&#x8d77;&#x6e90;&#x4e8e;&#x4e0d;&#x540c;&#x5e38;&#x67d3;&#x8272;&#x4f53;&#x4e0a;&#x72ec;&#x7acb;&#x83b7;&#x5f97;&#x7684;&#x6027;&#x522b;&#x51b3;&#x5b9a;&#x57fa;&#x56e0;&#xff0c;&#x4ee5;&#x53ca;&#x6765;&#x6e90;&#x4e8e;&#x7956;&#x5148;&#x4e2d;&#x4e0d;&#x540c;&#x7684;&#x5927;&#x67d3;&#x8272;&#x4f53;&#x548c;&#x5c0f;&#x67d3;&#x8272;&#x4f53;&#x4e4b;&#x95f4;&#x7684;&#x6613;&#x4f4d;&#x3002;&#x6211;&#x4eec;&#x8fdb;&#x4e00;&#x6b65;&#x63a2;&#x8ba8;&#x4e86;&#x722c;&#x884c;&#x52a8;&#x7269;&#x6027;&#x67d3;&#x8272;&#x4f53;&#x7f13;&#x6162;&#x5206;&#x5316;&#x548c;&#x76f8;&#x4e92;&#x4e4b;&#x95f4;&#x53d1;&#x751f;&#x98a0;&#x6362;&#x7684;&#x6f14;&#x5316;&#x9a71;&#x52a8;&#x56e0;&#x7d20;&#x3002;.",2022,"Cytogenetics; Genomics; Reptiles; Sex chromosome turnover; Sex determination; Animals; Australia; Cytogenetic Analysis; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Lizards; Male; Sex Chromosomes",147

Cranial radiation-induced gliomas (RIGs) are aggressive high-grade tumors with a dismal prognosis, for which no standard therapy exists. A definitive molecular signature for RIGs has not yet been established. We sought to address this gap by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of the molecular features of cranial RIGs. A systematic review of the literature was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Articles and case reports that described molecular analyses of cranial radiation-induced high-grade gliomas were identified and evaluated, and data extracted for collation. Of 1727 records identified, 31 were eligible, containing 102 unique RIGs with molecular data. The most frequent genetic alterations in RIGs included <i>PDGFRA</i> or <i>TP53</i> mutations, <i>PDGFRA</i> or <i>CDK4</i> amplifications, and <i>CDKN2A</i> deletion, along with 1q gain, 1p loss and 13q loss.

In addition to the status of KIT and PDGFRA, little is known about other potential GIST-related genes. In this study, we identified the mutation profiles in 49 KIT-mutated GIST tumors using the whole exome sequencing (WES) method. Furthermore, some representative mutations were further validated in an independent GIST cohort using the SNaPshot SNP assay. We identified extensive and diverse mutations of KIT in GIST, including many undescribed variants. In addition, we revealed some new tumor-related gene mutations with unknown pathogenicity. By enrichment analyses of gene function and protein-protein interaction network construction, we showed that these genes were enriched in several important cancer- or metabolism-related signaling pathways, including PI3K-AKT,RTK-RAS, Notch, Wnt, Hippo, mTOR, AMPK, and insulin signaling. In particular, DNA repair-related genes, including <i>MLH1</i>, <i>MSH6</i>, <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>, and <i>POLE</i>, are frequently mutated in GISTs, suggesting that immune checkpoint blockade may have promising clinical applications for these GIST subpopulations.

Antibody-based therapeutics, like antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based therapeutics, have emerged as promising strategies for anticancer drug delivery. The efficacy of these novel therapies is highly dependent on expression of the antibody target. We used RNA sequencing data from Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to analyze expression of target antigens in sarcoma subtypes including dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;50), uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULMS; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;27), leiomyosarcoma (STLMS; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;53), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;44), myxofibrosarcoma (MFS; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;17), synovial sarcoma (SS; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;10), and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;5). We searched published literature and clinicaltrial.gov for ADC targets, bispecific antibodies, immunotoxins, radioimmunoconjugates, SPEAR T-cells, and CAR's that are in clinical trials.

LRRC15 also appeared to be a relevant target, especially in UPS. MSLN expression was relatively low except in SS and MPNST. PDGFRA was also highly expressed in most sarcomas with the exception of ULMS and STLMS. TNFRSF8 seems to be most appropriate in DDLPS, as well as MFS. AXL was expressed especially in MFS and STLMS.

Although targeted inhibition of KIT/PDGFRA provides substantial clinical benefit, GIST cells adapt to KIT/PDGFRA driver suppression and eventually develop resistance. The specific molecular events leading to adaptive resistance in GIST remain unclear. By using clinically representative in vitro and in vivo GIST models and GIST patients' samples, we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Atrogin-1 (FBXO32)-the main effector of muscular atrophy in cachexia-resulted in the most critical gene derepressed in response to KIT inhibition, regardless the type of KIT primary or secondary mutation. Atrogin-1 in GISTs is transcriptionally controlled by the KIT-FOXO3a axis, thus indicating overlap with Atrogin-1 regulation mechanisms in nonneoplastic muscle cells. Further, Atrogin-1 overexpression was a GIST-cell-specific pro-survival mechanism that enabled the adaptation to KIT-targeted inhibition by apoptosis evasion through cell quiescence.

In neuroblastoma, MYCN acts as a major oncogenic driver through pleiotropic effects regulated by multiple protein encoding genes as well as microRNAs (miRNAs). MYCN activity is tightly controlled at the level of transcription and protein stability through various mechanisms. Like most genes, MYCN is further controlled by miRNAs, but the full complement of all miRNAs implicated in this process has not been determined through an unbiased approach. To elucidate the role of miRNAs in regulation of MYCN, we thus explored the MYCN-miRNA interactome to establish miRNAs controlling MYCN expression levels. We combined results from an unbiased and genome-wide high-throughput miRNA target reporter screen with miRNA and mRNA expression data from patients and a murine neuroblastoma progression model. We identified 29 miRNAs targeting MYCN, of which 12 miRNAs are inversely correlated with MYCN expression or activity in neuroblastoma tumor tissue. The majority of MYCN-targeting miRNAs in neuroblastoma showed a decrease in expression during murine MYCN-driven neuroblastoma tumor development. Therefore, we provide evidence that MYCN-targeting miRNAs are preferentially downregulated in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma, suggesting that MYCN negatively controls the expression of these miRNAs, to safeguard its expression.",2016,"MYCN; cross-species; feedback regulation; microRNA; neuroblastoma; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Animals; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; MicroRNAs; N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein; Neuroblastoma; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; RNA, Messenger; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Tumor Cells, Cultured",1
36552758,ZEB2,10.3390/cells11243993,SCAND1 Reverses Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Suppresses Prostate Cancer Growth and Migration.,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a reversible cellular program that transiently places epithelial (E) cells into pseudo-mesenchymal (M) cell states. The malignant progression and resistance of many carcinomas depend on EMT activation, partial EMT, or hybrid E/M status in neoplastic cells. EMT is activated by tumor microenvironmental TGF&#x3b2; signal and EMT-inducing transcription factors, such as ZEB1/2, in tumor cells. However, reverse EMT factors are less studied. We demonstrate that prostate epithelial transcription factor SCAND1 can reverse the cancer cell mesenchymal and hybrid E/M phenotypes to a more epithelial, less invasive status and inhibit their proliferation and migration in DU-145 prostate cancer cells. SCAND1 is a SCAN domain-containing protein and hetero-oligomerizes with SCAN-zinc finger transcription factors, such as MZF1, for accessing DNA and the transcriptional co-repression of target genes. We found that SCAND1 expression correlated with maintaining epithelial features, whereas the loss of SCAND1 was associated with mesenchymal phenotypes of tumor cells. SCAND1 and MZF1 were mutually inducible and coordinately included in chromatin with hetero-chromatin protein HP1&#x3b3;. The overexpression of SCAND1 reversed hybrid E/M status into an epithelial phenotype with E-cadherin and &#x3b2;-catenin relocation. Consistently, the co-expression analysis in TCGA PanCancer Atlas revealed that SCAND1 and MZF1 expression was negatively correlated with EMT driver genes, including CTNNB1, ZEB1, ZEB2 and TGFBRs, in prostate adenocarcinoma specimens. In addition, SCAND1 overexpression suppressed tumor cell proliferation by reducing the MAP3K-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. Of note, in a mouse tumor xenograft model, SCAND1 overexpression significantly reduced Ki-67(+) and Vimentin(+) tumor cells and inhibited migration and lymph node metastasis of prostate cancer. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed high expression of SCAND1 and MZF1 to correlate with better prognoses in pancreatic cancer and head and neck cancers, although with poorer prognosis in kidney cancer. Overall, these data suggest that SCAND1 induces expression and coordinated heterochromatin-binding of MZF1 to reverse the hybrid E/M status into an epithelial phenotype and, inhibits tumor cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis, potentially by repressing the gene expression of EMT drivers and the MAP3K-MEK-ERK signaling pathway.",2023,MZF1; SCAN zinc finger transcription factors; SCAND1; cancer prognosis; collective migration; epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT); gene expression; hybrid E/M; metastasis; partial EMT; Animals; Humans; Male; Mice; Chromatin; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases; Prostatic Neoplasms; Transcription Factors; Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1,27

Therapeutically, ETP-ALL patients frequently relapse after conventional chemotherapy highlighting the need for alternative therapeutic approaches. Using our ZEB2<sup>Tg</sup> ETP-ALL mouse model we previously documented the potential utility of the catalytic LSD1 inhibitor (GSK2879552) for treating mouse/human ETP-ALL. However, this approach proved to be inefficient, especially in killing human LOUCY cell ETP-ALL xenografts in vivo. Here we have revealed the novel involvement of ZEB2/LSD1 complexes in repressing the intrinsic apoptosis pathway by inhibiting the expression of several pro-apoptotic proteins such as BIM (BCL2L11) as a major driver for ETP-ALL survival. Treatment with LSD1i (particularly with the steric inhibitor SP2509) restored the expression of ZEB2/LSD1 pro-apoptotic BIM (BCL2L11) target. In combination with a JAK/STAT pathway inhibitor (JAKi, Ruxolitinib) or with a direct inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 protein (BCL2i, ABT-199) resistance of human and mouse ETP-ALL to LSD1i was reversed. This new combination approach efficiently inhibited the growth of human and mouse ETP-ALL cells in vivo by enhancing their differentiation and triggering an apoptotic response. These results set the stage for novel combination therapies to be used in clinical trials to treat ETP-ALL patients.",2022,Humans; Mice; Animals; Janus Kinases; STAT Transcription Factors; Signal Transduction; Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Bcl-2-Like Protein 11; Janus Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Histone Demethylases,27

However, whether histone modification can aid the classification of patients or influence clinical behavior in patients with colon cancer remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate histone modifier expression patterns using the unsupervised clustering of the transcriptomic expressions of 88 histone acetylation and methylation regulators. In this study, by consensus clustering analysis based on the transcriptome data of 88 histone modification regulators, we identified four distinct expression patterns of histone modifiers associated with different prognoses, intrinsic fluorouracil sensitivities, biological pathways, and tumor microenvironment characteristics among 1372 colon cancer samples. In these four clusters, the HMC4 cluster represented a stroma activation phenotype characterized by both the worst prognosis and lowest response rates to fluorouracil treatment. Then, we established a scoring scheme comprising 155 genes designated as ""HM_score"" by using the Boruta algorithm to distinguish colon cancer patients within the HMC4 cluster. Patients with a high HM_score were considered to have high stromal pathway activation, high stromal fraction, and an unfavorable prognosis. Further analyses indicated that a high HM_score also correlated with reduced therapeutic benefits from fluorouracil chemotherapy. Moreover, through CRISPR library screening, ZEB2 was found to be a critical driver gene that mediates fluorouracil resistance, which is associated with histone modifier expression patterns. This study highlights that characterizing histone modifier expression patterns may help better understand the epigenetic mechanisms underlying tumor heterogeneity in patients with colon cancer and provide more personalized therapeutic strategies.",2022,"CRISPR library screen; Chemotherapy; Colon cancer; Fluorouracil; Histone modifications; Prognosis; ZEB2; Acetylation; Biomarkers, Tumor; Colonic Neoplasms; DNA Methylation; Fluorouracil; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Histones; Humans; Prognosis; Tumor Microenvironment",27

Gene and miRNA expression arrays were performed in 35 MECs and six NSGs. We found 46 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs and 3,162 DE mRNAs. Supervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the DE transcripts revealed two clusters in both miRNA and mRNA profiles, which distinguished MEC from NSG samples. The integrative miRNA-mRNA analysis revealed a network comprising 696 negatively correlated interactions (44 miRNAs and 444 mRNAs) involving cell signaling, cell cycle, and cancer-related pathways. Increased expression levels of miR-205-5p and miR-224-5p and decreased expression levels of miR-139-3p, miR-145-3p, miR-148a-3p, miR-186-5p, miR-338-3p, miR-363-3p, and miR-4324 were significantly related to worse overall survival in MEC patients. Two overexpressed miRNAs in MEC (miR-22 and miR-205) were selected for inhibition by the CRISPR-Cas9 method. Cell viability, migration, and invasion assays were performed using an intermediate grade MEC cell line. Knockout of miR-205 reduced cell viability and enhanced <i>ZEB2</i> expression, while miR-22 knockout reduced cell migration and invasion and enhanced <i>ESR1</i> expression. Our results indicate a distinct transcriptomic profile of MEC compared to NSG, and the integrative analysis highlighted miRNA-mRNA interactions involving cancer-related pathways, including PTEN and PI3K/AKT.

Moreover, expression levels of six miRNAs were significantly decreased in metastatic tumors in comparison with nonmetastatic ones, and downregulation of miR-203a-3p was the most significant. We revealed an inverse relationship between expression levels of miR-203a-3p and those of <i>ZEB1</i> and <i>ZEB2</i> genes, which are EMT drivers. We also identified three miRNA genes (<i>MIR148A</i>, <i>MIR9-1</i>, and <i>MIR193A</i>) that likely regulate EMT-MET reversion in the colonization of PMM.

ALL subtypes are driven by distinct mutational processes with AID mutagenesis being confined to ETV6-RUNX1 tumours. Subclonality is a ubiquitous feature of ALL, consistent with Darwinian evolution driving selection and expansion of tumours.

ZEB1 and ZEB2 drive EMT through transcriptional repression of cell-cell junction proteins and members of the tumor suppressive miR200 family. However, in estrogen receptor positive (ER&#x2009;+) breast cancer, the role of ZEB2 as an independent driver of metastasis has not been fully investigated. In the current study, we induced exogenous expression of ZEB2 in ER&#x2009;+&#x2009;MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell lines and examined EMT gene expression and metastasis using dose-response qRT-PCR, transwell migration assays, proliferation assays with immunofluorescence of Ki-67 staining. We used RNA sequencing to identify pathways and genes affected by ZEB2 overexpression. Finally, we treated ZEB2-overexpressing cells with 17&#x3b2;-estradiol (E2) or ICI 182,780 to evaluate how ZEB2 affects estrogen response. Contrary to expectation, we found that ZEB2 did not increase canonical epithelial nor decrease mesenchymal gene expressions. Furthermore, ZEB2 overexpression did not promote a mesenchymal cell morphology. However, ZEB1 and ZEB2 protein expression induced significant migration of MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells in vitro and MCF-7 xenograft metastasis in vivo. Transcriptomic (RNA sequencing) pathway analysis revealed alterations in estrogen signaling regulators and pathways, suggesting a role for ZEB2 in endocrine sensitivity in luminal A breast cancer. Expression of ZEB2 was negatively correlated with estrogen receptor complex genes in luminal A patient tumors. Furthermore, treatment with 17&#x3b2;-estradiol (E2) or the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 had no effect on growth of ZEB2-overexpressing cells.

To date however, the molecular basis of COSCC remains poorly understood. To identify changes pertinent to cancer cells in COSCC, we specifically analyzed tumor cells and matched normal epithelium from clinical formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens using laser-capture-microdissection coupled with RNA-sequencing (RNAseq). Our results identify strong contributions of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), classical tumor-promoting (such as E2F, KRAS, MYC, mTORC1, and TGFB1 signaling) and immune-related pathways in the tumor epithelium of COSCC. Comparative analyses of COSCC with 43 paired tumor/normal HNSCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed a high homology in transcriptional reprogramming, and identified processes associated with cell cycle progression, immune processes, and loss of cellular differentiation as likely central drivers of the disease. Similar to HNSCC, our analyses suggested a ZEB2-driven partial EMT in COSCC and identified selective upregulation of KRT14 and KRT17 in COSCC. Beyond homology in transcriptional signatures, we also found therapeutic vulnerabilities strongly conserved between the species: these included increased expression of PD-L1 and CTLA-4, coinciding with EMT and revealing the potential for immune checkpoint therapies, and overexpression of CDK4/6 that sensitized COSCC to treatment with palbociclib.

Consequently, there is a need to mechanistically identify the factors driving this process. The transcription factors of the zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox family, consisting of ZEB1 and ZEB2, are notorious for their roles in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, in melanoma, an intrinsic balance between ZEB1 and ZEB2 seems to determine the cellular state by modulating the expression of the master regulator of melanocyte homeostasis, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). ZEB2 drives MITF expression and is associated with a differentiated/proliferative melanoma cell state. On the other hand, ZEB1 is correlated with low MITF expression and a more invasive, stem cell-like and therapy-resistant cell state. This intrinsic balance between ZEB1 and ZEB2 could prove to be a promising therapeutic target for melanoma patients. In this review, we will summarise what is known on the functional mechanisms of these transcription factors. Moreover, we will look specifically at their roles during melanocyte-lineage development and homeostasis.

However, the role of <i>lncRNA H19</i> in human papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) remains controversial. The aim of the study was to investigate the expression and potential function of <i>lncRNA H19</i> in human PTC. The <i>lncRNA H19</i> level was determined by quantitative real-time (RT)-PCR analyses in 58 PTC tissue samples and their paired paracancerous tissue samples. RNA interference, RT-PCR analysis, and Western blot assay were used to determine the impact of <i>lncRNA H19</i> on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in human PTC cells. The migratory and invasive capacities of PTC cells were determined by wound-healing and transwell migration and invasion assays. <i>lncRNA H19</i> expression was 2.417-fold higher in PTC tissues than their paired paracancerous tissue (95% CI: 1.898-2.935, <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001).

Therefore, inflammation-associated metastasis in the development of CRC is currently a topic of considerable interest. In the present study, the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) was identified to promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells. However, the enhancing effect of IL-4 was more evident in HCT116 cells compared with in RKO cells. Accordingly, an increased expression level of STAT6 was observed in HCT116 cells compared with RKO cells. Further investigations identified that E2F1 was required for maintaining the level of signal transducer and activator of transcription&#xa0;6 (STAT6) in HCT116 cells. Mechanistically, E2F1 induced specificity protein&#xa0;3&#xa0;(SP3) directly by binding to the promoter of the STAT6 gene and activating its transcription in CRC cells. As a result, phosphorylation-activated STAT6 increased the expression of several EMT drivers, including zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox&#xa0;(Zeb)1 and Zeb2, which serve a critical function in IL-4-induced EMT. Rescue experiments further confirmed that IL-4-induced EMT relied on an intact E2F1/SP3/STAT6 axis in CRC cells.

Consistently, ectopic over-expression of miR-200 family miRNAs in mesenchymal-like cells reverses the process by converting treated cells to an epithelial phenotype, thereby reducing invasiveness and increasing sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. To better understand the dynamics and molecular processes underlying miRNA-induced mesenchymal-to mesenchymal transition (MET), a time-course study was conducted where miRNA-induced morphological and molecular changes associated with MET were monitored over a period of 144&#x202f;h. Morphological transition from an elongated mesenchymal-like to a cuboidal epithelial-like phenotype is maximized at 48&#x202f;h with cells returning to the elongated phenotype by 144&#x202f;h. Changes in the expression of &gt;3000 genes, including many previously associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), are most pronounced at 48&#x202f;h, and approach starting levels of expression by 144&#x202f;h.

A recently developed tool well suited for this line of investigation is the Pdx-1-Cre;Cdh1<sup>F/+</sup> ;Trp53<sup>F/F</sup> ;Smad4<sup>F/F</sup> (pC<sup>he</sup> PS) mouse model that spontaneously develops metastatic DGC showing nearly complete E-cadherin loss. Here, we performed a proteogenomic analysis to uncover the molecular changes induced by the concurrent targeting of E-cadherin, p53, and Smad4 loss. The gene expression profiles of mouse DGCs and in vivo gastric phenotypes from various combinations of gene knockout demonstrated that these mutations collaborate to activate cancer-associated pathways to generate aggressive DGC. Of note, WNT-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and extracellular matrix (ECM)-cytokine receptor interactions were prominently featured. In particular, the WNT target gene osteopontin (OPN) that functions as an ECM cytokine is highly upregulated. In validation experiments, OPN contributed to DGC stemness by promoting cancer stem cell (CSC) survival and chemoresistance. It was further found that Bcl-xL acts as a targetable downstream effector of OPN in DGC CSC survival. In addition, Zeb2 and thymosin-&#x3b2;4 (T&#x3b2;4) were identified as prime candidates as suppressors of E-cadherin expression from the remaining Cdh1 allele during DGC development. Specifically, T&#x3b2;4 suppressed E-cadherin expression and anoikis while promoting cancer cell growth and migration.

Recent studies have reported key roles for individual miRNA editing events, but a comprehensive picture of miRNA editing in human cancers remains largely unexplored. Here, we systematically characterized the miRNA editing profiles of 8595 samples across 20 cancer types from miRNA sequencing data of The Cancer Genome Atlas and identified 19 adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing hotspots. We independently validated 15 of them by perturbation experiments in several cancer cell lines. These miRNA editing events show extensive correlations with key clinical variables (e.g., tumor subtype, disease stage, and patient survival time) and other molecular drivers. Focusing on the RNA editing hotspot in miR-200b, a key tumor metastasis suppressor, we found that the miR-200b editing level correlates with patient prognosis opposite to the pattern observed for the wild-type miR-200b expression. We further experimentally showed that, in contrast to wild-type miRNA, the edited miR-200b can promote cell invasion and migration through its impaired ability to inhibit <i>ZEB1/ZEB2</i> and acquired concomitant ability to repress new targets, including <i>LIFR</i>, a well-characterized metastasis suppressor.

Tumor growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-&#x3b2;1) is an important factor in EMT induction in tumorigenesis. The targeting of EMT may, therefore, represent a promising approach in anticancer treatment. In this study, we determined the effect of decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, on TGF-&#x3b2;1-induced EMT in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) PC9 and A549 cells. We also assessed the involvement of the miR-200/ZEB axis. Decitabine reversed TGF-&#x3b2;1-induced EMT in PC9 cells, but not in A549 cells. This phenomenon was associated with epigenetic changes in the miR-200 family, which regulated EMT by altering the expression of <i>ZEB1</i> and <i>ZEB2</i>. TGF-&#x3b2;1 induced aberrant methylation in miR-200 promoters, leading to EMT in PC9 cells. Decitabine attenuated this effect and inhibited tumor cell migration in vitro and in vivo. In A549 cells, however, neither TGF-&#x3b2;1 nor decitabine exhibited an effect on miR-200 promoter methylation. Our findings suggest that epigenetic regulation of the miR-200/ZEB axis is responsible for EMT induction by TGF-&#x3b2;1 in PC9 cells.

In prostate cancer, EMP has been associated with both suppression and activation of the androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Here we investigated the effect of the potent AR antagonist enzalutamide on EMP in multiple preclinical models of prostate cancer and patient tissues. Enzalutamide treatment significantly enhanced the expression of EMP drivers (ZEB1, ZEB2, Snail, Twist, and FOXC2) and mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, fibronectin, and vimentin) in prostate cancer cells, enhanced prostate cancer cell migration, and induced prostate cancer transformation to a spindle, fibroblast-like morphology. Enzalutamide-induced EMP required concomitant suppression of AR signaling and activation of the EMP-promoting transcription factor Snail, as evidenced by both knockdown and overexpression studies. Supporting these findings, AR signaling and Snail expression were inversely correlated in C4-2 xenografts, patient-derived castration-resistant metastases, and clinical samples. For the first time, we elucidate a mechanism explaining the inverse relationship between AR and Snail. Specifically, we found that AR directly repressed <i>SNAI1</i> gene expression by binding to specific AR-responsive elements within the <i>SNAI1</i> promoter. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that de-repression of Snail and induction of EMP is an adaptive response to enzalutamide with implications for therapy resistance. <i>Cancer Res; 77(11); 3101-12. &#xa9;2017 AACR</i>.",2017,"Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Humans; Male; Mice; Prostatic Neoplasms; Receptors, Androgen; Signal Transduction; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",27

However, acquired resistance to TKIs invariably develops within approximately 1 year of treatment by various mechanisms, including gatekeeper mutations, alternative pathway activation and histological transformations. Because immunotherapy is an option for patients with drug-resistant cancers, we generated several TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines in vitro, and then evaluated the cytotoxicity of NK92-CD16 cells to these resistant cells. TKI-resistant NSCLC cells (H3122CR1, H3122LR1, H3122CR1LR1, PC-9GR, PC-9ER, EBC-CR1 and EBC-CR2) were established from NCI-H3122 (EML4-ALK fusion), PC-9 (EGFR exon19 deletion) and EBC-1 (MET amplification) after continuous exposure to crizotinib, ceritinib, gefitinib, erlotinib and capmatinib. Expression of ligands for natural killer (NK) cell receptors and total EGFR were analyzed using flow cytometry. NK cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) using anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) cetuximab were measured using NK92-CD16 as effectors and detected using the <sup>51</sup>Chromium-release assay. We found that NK92-CD16 cells preferentially killed TKI-resistant NSCLC cells when compared with their parental NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) was up-regulated in the TKI-resistant NSCLC cells and patients' tumors, and the ICAM-1 up-regulated cancer cells lines were less susceptible to NK cytotoxicity by blocking ICAM-1. Moreover, NK92-CD16 cell-induced cytotoxicity toward TKI-resistant NSCLC cells was enhanced in the presence of cetuximab, an EGFR-targeting mAb. These data suggest that combinational treatment with NK cell-based immunotherapy and cetuximab may be promising for patients with TKI-resistant NSCLC.",2020,"NK92-CD16; acquired resistance; cetuximab; intracellular adhesion molecule 1; non-small cell lung cancer; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Cetuximab; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Humans; Immunotherapy, Adoptive; Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1; Killer Cells, Natural; Lung Neoplasms; Oncogenes; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Receptors, IgG",2

Previously, we demonstrated that aglycosylated human IgG1 Fc variants can engage the human Fc&#x3b3;RII class of the low-affinity hFc&#x3b3;Rs, demonstrating that N-linked glycosylation of the Fc is not a strict requirement for hFc&#x3b3;R engagement. In the present study, we demonstrate that aglycosylated IgG variants can be engineered to productively engage with Fc&#x3b3;RIIIA, as well as the human Fc gamma RII subset. We also assess the biophysical properties and serum half-life of the aglycosylated IgG variants to measure stability. Aglycosylated constructs N297D/S298T (DTT)-K326I/A327Y/L328G (IYG) and N297D/S298A-IYG optimally drove tumor cell phagocytosis. A mathematical model of phagocytosis suggests that hFc&#x3b3;RI and hFc&#x3b3;RIIIA dimers were the main drivers of phagocytosis. In vivo tumor control of B16F10 lung metastases further confirmed the variant DTT-IYG to be the best at restoring wild-type-like properties in prevention of lung metastases. While deuterium incorporation was similar across most of the protein, several peptides within the CH2 domain of DTT-IYG showed differential deuterium uptake in the peptide region of the FG loop as compared to the aglycosylated N297Q. Thus, in this study, we have found an aglycosylated variant that may effectively substitute for wild-type Fc. These aglycosylated variants have the potential to allow therapeutic antibodies to be produced in virtually any expression system and still maintain effector function.",2017,"Fc-gamma receptor; antibody engineering; directed evolution; yeast display; Animals; Biophysical Phenomena; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Models, Animal; Glycosylation; Half-Life; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Immunologic Factors; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Models, Theoretical; Neoplasm Metastasis; Phagocytosis; Protein Binding; Protein Engineering; Receptors, IgG; Recombinant Proteins",2

Identification of driver genes of metastatic progression is essential, as metastases, not primary tumors, are fatal. To gain insight into the mutational concordance between different steps of malignant progression we performed exome sequencing and validation with targeted deep sequencing of successive steps of malignant progression from pre-invasive stages to asynchronous distant metastases in six breast cancer patients. Using the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations, a surprisingly large number of cancer driver genes, ranging between 3 and 145, were estimated to confer a selective advantage in the studied primary tumors. We report a substantial amount of metastasis specific mutations and a number of novel putative metastasis driver genes. Most notable are the DCC, ABCA13, TIAM2, CREBBP, BCL6B and ZNF185 genes, mainly mutated exclusively in metastases and highly likely driver genes of metastatic progression. We find different genes and pathways to be affected at different steps of malignant progression.

However, the role of copper metabolism and cuproptosis on hepatic carcinoma is still unclear. In this study, the TCGA database was used as the test set, and the ICGC database and self-built database were used as the validation set. We screened out a class of copper metabolism and cuproptosis-related genes (CMCRGs) that could influence hepatic carcinoma prognosis by survival analysis and differential comparison. Based on CMCRGs, patients were divided into two subtypes by cluster analysis. The C2 subtype was defined as the high copper related subtype, while the C1 subtype was defied as the low copper related subtype. At the clinical level, compared with the C1 subtype, the C2 subtype had higher grade pathological features, risk scores, and worse survival. In addition, the immune response and metabolic status also differed between C1 and C2. Specifically, C2 subtype had a higher proportion of immune cell composition and highly expressed immune checkpoint genes. C2 subtype had a higher TIDE score with a higher proportion of tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion. At the molecular level, the C2 subtype had a higher frequency of driver gene mutations (TP53 and OBSCN). Mechanistically, the single nucleotide polymorphisms of C2 subtype had a very strong transcriptional strand bias for C&gt;A mutations. Copy number variations in the C2 subtype were characterized by LOXL3 CNV gain, which also showed high association with PDCD1/CTLA4. Finally, drug sensitivity responsiveness was assessed in both subtypes. C2 subtype had lower IC50 values for targeted and chemotherapeutic agents (sorafenib, imatinib and methotrexate, etc.). Thus, CMCRGs related subtypes showed poor response to immunotherapy and better responsiveness to targeted agents, and the results might provide a reference for precision treatment of hepatic carcinoma.",2023,"copper metabolism; cuproptosis; hepatic carcinoma; prognosis; therapy; tumor immune microenvironment; Humans; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Copper; CTLA-4 Antigen; DNA Copy Number Variations; Imatinib Mesylate; Liver Neoplasms; Methotrexate; Prognosis; Sorafenib; Tumor Microenvironment; Apoptosis",78

Transcriptomic quantification was determined by high-throughput RNA sequencing. We investigated the associations of clinical parameters and molecular signatures using RNA sequencing. We validated predictive biomarkers using the Cancer Genome Atlas database. Through a comparison of differentially expressed genes, gene sets, and pathways in papillary thyroid cancer compared to normal tumor-adjacent tissue, we found increased immune signaling associated with cytokines or T cells and decreased thyroid hormone synthetic pathways. In addition, patients with recurrence presented increased CD8+ T-cell and Th1-cell signatures. Interestingly, we found differentially overexpressed genes related to immune-escape signaling such as CTLA4, IDO1, LAG3, and PDCD1 in advanced papillary thyroid cancer with a low thyroid differentiation score. Fusion analysis showed that the PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways were regulated differently according to the RET fusion partner genes (CCDC6 or NCOA4). Finally, we identified HOXD9 as a novel molecular biomarker that predicts the recurrence of thyroid cancer in addition to known risk factors (tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and extrathyroidal extension). We identified a high association with immune-escape signaling in the immune-hot group with aggressive clinical characteristics among Korean thyroid cancer patients.

The results showed that ICI-based therapies could provide a pooled median overall survival (mOS) (POS) of 15.79 (95% CI: 14.85-16.73) months, and there were no significant differences in OS, progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and grade 3 or higher adverse events (&#x2265;3AEs) between DICI-based treatments (POS: 14.81, 12.11-17.52 months) and SICI-based treatments (POS: 16.17, 14.59-17.74 months) in overall patients. However, DICI-based treatments had significantly prolonged the OS over SICI-based treatments in squamous and PD-L1 &lt;1% subgroups.

We present the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic data from patients enrolled in the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expansion cohorts of the phase 1 first-in-human study of budigalimab monotherapy (NCT03000257; registered 15 December 2016). Patients with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC or locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC naive to PD-1/PD-1-ligand inhibitors were enrolled; patients were not selected on the basis of oncogene driver mutations or PD-L1 status. Budigalimab was administered at 250&#xa0;mg intravenously Q2W or 500&#xa0;mg intravenously Q4W until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoints were safety and PK; the secondary endpoint was efficacy. Exploratory endpoints included biomarker assessments.

Targeting the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 showed promising results in breast cancer and especially in TNBC. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) is an important driver of carcinogenesis. Here, the effect of combined PD-1/PD-L1 and ERK1/2 inhibitor treatment is investigated of cell growth and intracellular impact of breast cancer cell lines. The IC<sub>50</sub> values of each inhibitor and the effect of combined treatment were determined in three TNBC cell lines of different subtypes and one non-TNBC cell line. Phospho-specific antibodies were used in western blot analyses to investigate an effect on ERK1/2 activation. Expressions of immune modulatory and cell cycle-associated genes were examined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Both inhibitors PD-1/PD-L1 and ERK1/2 impeded the proliferation of TNBC to a higher extent than of non-TNBC. By combined treatment, cell lines were inhibited either synergistically or additively. ERK1/2 and S6 phosphorylation were reduced and expressions of c-Fos and FosL were diminished after ERK1/2 inhibitor as single and combined treatment. Between genes involved in immune modulation, IL-8 was upregulated in TNBC cells after combined treatment. In conclusion, combination of PD-1/PD-L1 and ERK1/2 inhibitors showed favorable effects for a new therapy strategy, with better results in TNBC cell lines than in non-TNBC cells.

34093873,PDCD1,10.7150/thno.58039,Genomic and transcriptional alterations in first-line chemotherapy exert a potentially unfavorable influence on subsequent immunotherapy in NSCLC.,"<b>Background:</b> Recent studies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have demonstrated that first-line immunotherapy is associated with better therapeutic response than second-line treatment. So far, the mechanisms need to be explored. It prompted us to evaluate the association between first-line chemotherapy and subsequent immunotherapy in NSCLC as well as its underlying mechanisms at the genomic and transcriptomic level. <b>Methods:</b> We launched a prospective, observational clinical study, paired tumor biopsies before and after chemotherapy were collected from NSCLC patients without tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-related driver gene mutations. The analyses included genomic and transcriptional changes performed by next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based whole-exome sequencing (WES) and messager ribonucleic acid (mRNA) sequencing. Characteristic mutational alterations in 1574 genes were investigated based on mutational status, clinicopathological factors, and chemotherapy responses. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, neoantigen prediction and intratumoral heterogeneity evaluation were also performed. <b>Results:</b> Samples and information from 32 NSCLC patients without TKI-related driver gene mutations were obtained. We found that the total number of single nucleotide variants (SNV)/insertion-deletion (INDEL) mutations did not change significantly after chemotherapy. The tumor mutation burden (TMB) decreased significantly after chemotherapy in smoking patients and the decreased TMB correlated with a better survival of smoking patients. The change in copy number variations (CNVs) exhibited a decreasing trend during chemotherapy. Subsequent analysis at mRNA level revealed a significant decrease in the expression levels of genes related to antigen processing and presentation as well as other factors relevant for response to immunotherapy. Pathway enrichment analysis confirmed that the immune-related signaling pathways or biological processes were decreased after first-line chemotherapy. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our study presents an explanation for the unsatisfactory results of immunotherapy when given after chemotherapy, and suggests that first-line chemotherapy is able to influence the tumor microenvironment and decrease the efficacy of subsequent immunotherapy.

34069461,PDCD1,10.3390/nu13051718,Polyphenols Modulating Effects of PD-L1/PD-1 Checkpoint and EMT-Mediated PD-L1 Overexpression in Breast Cancer.,"Investigating dietary polyphenolic compounds as antitumor agents are rising due to the growing evidence of the close association between immunity and cancer. Cancer cells elude immune surveillance for enhancing their progression and metastasis utilizing various mechanisms. These mechanisms include the upregulation of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) cell phenotype activation. In addition to its role in stimulating normal embryonic development, EMT has been identified as a critical driver in various aspects of cancer pathology, including carcinogenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. Furthermore, EMT conversion to another phenotype, Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition (MET), is crucial in developing cancer metastasis. A central mechanism in the upregulation of PD-L1 expression in various cancer types is EMT signaling activation. In breast cancer (BC) cells, the upregulated level of PD-L1 has become a critical target in cancer therapy. Various signal transduction pathways are involved in EMT-mediated PD-L1 checkpoint overexpression. Three main groups are considered potential targets in EMT development; the effectors (E-cadherin and Vimentin), the regulators (Zeb, Twist, and Snail), and the inducers that include members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#x3b2;). Meanwhile, the correlation between consuming flavonoid-rich food and the lower risk of cancers has been demonstrated. In BC, polyphenols were found to downregulate PD-L1 expression. This review highlights the effects of polyphenols on the EMT process by inhibiting mesenchymal proteins and upregulating the epithelial phenotype.

However, recent studies have shown that some patients with driver genes are still benefit from combination immunotherapy after tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) drug resistance. The purpose of this study was to analyze the efficacy of posterior line immunotherapy in NSCLC patients with epidermal growth factor (EGFR) sensitive mutation, and to evaluate the value of immunotherapy in posterior line therapy in patients with advanced EGFR mutation. A total of 27 patients with EGFR mutation diagnosed in Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University from June 2018 to November 2020 were collected. After the progress of targeted therapy, they had received programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitor combined with chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic drug therapy. Of the 27 advanced NSCLC patients, 19 cases (70.4%) did not have T790M mutation. There were 8 cases (29.6%) with T790M point mutation. The total objective response rate (ORR) was 40.7%. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference among different EGFR mutations (&#x3c7;&#xb2;=4.15, P=0.230). But progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer in patients without T790M mutation than in patients with T790M mutation (9.2 mon vs 3.3 mon, &#x3c7;&#xb2;=2.808, P=0.041), and the same trend was observed in patients with overall survival treated with the PD-1 inhibitor (12.2 mon vs 7.3 mon, &#x3c7;&#xb2;=3.22, P=0.062). ORR of patients without T790M was significantly better than that with T790M (52.63% vs 12.5%, P=0.045). Patients with EGFR mutation can benefit from later-line combined immunotherapy. The patients with T790M mutation in the population of EGFR mutation had the worst effect of immunotherapy in the later line. Therefore, the follow-up treatment and whole-course management of these patients need to explore better treatment strategies to improve the benefit. &#x3010;&#x4e2d;&#x6587;&#x9898;&#x76ee;&#xff1a;EGFR&#x7a81;&#x53d8;&#x665a;&#x671f;&#x975e;&#x5c0f;&#x7ec6;&#x80de;&#x80ba;&#x764c;&#x60a3;&#x8005;&#x540e;&#x7ebf;&#x2029;&#x63a5;&#x53d7;&#x514d;&#x75ab;&#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x7684;&#x7597;&#x6548;&#x5206;&#x6790;&#x3011;

Persistent activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling circuitry represents a key oncogenic driver in HNSCC; however, the potential immunosuppressive effects of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors may limit the benefit of their combination with ICB. Here we employ an unbiased kinome-wide siRNA screen to reveal that HER3, is essential for the proliferation of most HNSCC cells that do not harbor PIK3CA mutations. Indeed, we find that persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of HER3 and PI3K recruitment underlies aberrant PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in PIK3CA wild type HNSCCs. Remarkably, antibody-mediated HER3 blockade exerts a potent anti-tumor effect by suppressing HER3-PI3K-AKT-mTOR oncogenic signaling and concomitantly reversing the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. Ultimately, we show that HER3 inhibition and PD-1 blockade may provide a multimodal precision immunotherapeutic approach for PIK3CA wild type HNSCC, aimed at achieving durable cancer remission.",2021,"Animals; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors; Immunotherapy; Mice; Mutation; Precision Medicine; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Receptor, ErbB-3; Signal Transduction; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Tumor Microenvironment; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",78

In a cohort of 72 patients, BRAF mutation subtyping revealed p.V600E mutations in 31 cases (43%), whereas 41 cases (57%) harboured 18 different BRAF&#xa0;mutational subtypes of functional classes II/III. Functionally relevant comutations were observed in 6.4% of class I, and 24.4% of class II/III BRAF&#xa0;mutations. Most patients were treated with chemotherapy. Targeted therapy was administered in 11 patients with a response rate of 72.7%. PD-1/PD-L1-immunotherapy was given in 14 patients with a response rate of 28.6%. Overall survival of patients with BRAF-mutated NSCLC was inferior (HR 1.38, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.048) as compared to patients with BRAF wild-type cancers. Median time-to-treatment-failure with BRAF-targeting agents was shorter as compared to approved targeted therapy of other oncogenic drivers (HR 1.97, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.05). Survival outcomes were not impacted by BRAF&#xa0;mutation subtype functional class. Patients with BRAF-mutated NSCLC have an inferior prognosis, which is not determined by BRAF&#xa0;mutation functional class. In contrast to NSCLC with other tractable driver mutations, BRAF-mutated NSCLC exhibit high susceptibility to immune checkpoint inhibitors.",2021,"BRAF mutation functional class; BRAF mutation subtype; BRAF-Mutated lung cancer; BRAF-Targeted therapy; NSCLC immunotherapy; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; B7-H1 Antigen; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Databases, Factual; Female; Germany; Humans; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Precision Medicine; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",78

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an important driver of HCC. Immunotherapy has been approved for treating HCC, but biomarker-based stratification of patients for optimal response to therapy is an unmet need<sup>6,7</sup>. Here we report the progressive accumulation of exhausted, unconventionally activated CD8<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells in NASH-affected livers. In preclinical models of NASH-induced HCC, therapeutic immunotherapy targeted at programmed death-1 (PD1) expanded activated CD8<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells within tumours but did not lead to tumour regression, which indicates that tumour immune surveillance was impaired. When given prophylactically, anti-PD1 treatment led to an increase in the incidence of NASH-HCC and in the number and size of tumour nodules, which correlated with increased hepatic CD8<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup>CXCR6<sup>+</sup>, TOX<sup>+</sup>, and TNF<sup>+</sup> T cells. The increase in HCC triggered by anti-PD1 treatment was prevented by depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or TNF neutralization, suggesting that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells help to induce NASH-HCC, rather than invigorating or executing immune surveillance. We found similar phenotypic and functional profiles in hepatic CD8<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells from humans with NAFLD or NASH. A meta-analysis of three randomized phase III clinical trials that tested inhibitors of PDL1 (programmed death-ligand 1) or PD1 in more than 1,600 patients with advanced HCC revealed that immune therapy did not improve survival in patients with non-viral HCC. In two additional cohorts, patients with NASH-driven HCC who received anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 treatment showed reduced overall survival compared to patients with other aetiologies. Collectively, these data show that non-viral HCC, and particularly NASH-HCC, might be less responsive to immunotherapy, probably owing to NASH-related aberrant T cell activation causing tissue damage that leads to impaired immune surveillance. Our data provide a rationale for stratification of patients with HCC according to underlying aetiology in studies of immunotherapy as a primary or adjuvant treatment.",2021,"Animals; B7-H1 Antigen; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Carcinogenesis; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Disease Progression; Humans; Immunotherapy; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",78

However, only a small proportion of patients respond to ICI therapy. It is, therefore, essential to understand the mechanisms driving therapy resistance and to develop strategies for increasing response rates. We previously demonstrated that in response to various cancer treatment modalities, the host activates a range of biological processes that promote tumor regrowth and metastasis. Here, we characterize the host-mediated response to ICI therapy, and investigate its contribution to therapy resistance. Tumor cell migration, invasion and motility were assessed in the presence of plasma from ICI-treated mice and patients. Immune cell composition in peripheral blood and tumors of ICI-treated mice was assessed by flow and mass cytometry. Plasma host factors driving tumor aggressiveness were identified by proteomic profiling, followed by bioinformatic analysis. The therapeutic effect of inhibiting host-mediated processes in ICI-treated mice was assessed in a tumor model. Tumor cells exhibit enhanced migratory and invasive properties in vitro on exposure to plasma from anti-PD1-treated mice. Moreover, mice intravenously injected with plasma-exposed tumor cells display increased metastatic burden and mortality rate in comparison to control arms. Furthermore, tumors from anti-PD1-treated mice as well as Matrigel plugs containing plasma from anti-PD1-treated mice are highly infiltrated with immune cell types associated with both antitumor and protumor activity. These collective findings suggest that anti-PD1 treatment induces a systemic host response that potentially counteracts the drug's therapeutic activity. Proteomic profiling of plasma from anti-PD1-treated mice reveals an activation of multiple biological pathways associated with tumor aggressiveness. Consequently, blocking IL-6, one of the key drivers of the identified biological pathways, counteracts ICI-induced metastatic properties in vitro and improves ICI treatment efficacy in vivo. Lastly, plasma samples from ICI-treated non-small cell lung cancer patients differentially affect tumor cell aggressiveness in vitro, with enhanced tumor cell motility correlating with a worse clinical outcome. ICI therapy induces host-mediated processes that contribute to therapy resistance. Identification and analysis of such processes may lead to the discovery of biomarkers for clinical response and strategies for overcoming therapy resistance.",2021,"combination; cytokines; drug therapy; immunomodulation; immunotherapy; A549 Cells; Adaptive Immunity; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Lewis Lung; Cell Movement; Cytokines; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Humans; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors; Melanoma, Experimental; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, SCID; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasms; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; Skin Neoplasms",78

Oncogenic driver alterations such as <i>EGFR</i> mutation, <i>ALK</i> translocation, <i>ROS1</i> translocation, and <i>BRAF</i> mutation predict response to treatment for LUAD. Since oncogenic driver alterations may modulate immune response in tumor microenvironment that may influence prognosis in LUAD, the effects of <i>EGFR</i>, <i>ALK</i>, <i>ROS1</i>, and <i>BRAF</i> alterations on tumor microenvironment remain unclear. Immune-related prognostic model associated with oncogenic driver alterations is needed. In this study, we performed the Cox-proportional Hazards Analysis based on the L1-penalized (LASSO) Analysis to establish an immune-related prognostic model (IPM) in stage I-II LUAD patients, which was based on 3 immune-related genes (<i>PDE4B</i>, <i>RIPK2</i>, and <i>IFITM1</i>) significantly enriched in patients without <i>EGFR</i>, <i>ALK</i>, <i>ROS1</i>, and <i>BRAF</i> alterations in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Then, patients were categorized into high-risk and low-risk groups individually according to the IPM defined risk score. The predicting ability of the IPM was validated in GSE31210 and GSE26939 downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. High-risk was significantly associated with lower overall survival (OS) rates in 3 independent stage I-II LUAD cohorts (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the IPM defined risk independently predicted OS for patients in TCGA stage I-II LUAD cohort (<i>P</i> = 0.011). High-risk group had significantly higher proportions of macrophages M1 and activated mast cells but lower proportions of memory B cells, resting CD4 memory T cells and resting mast cells than low-risk group (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). In addition, the high-risk group had a significantly lower expression of <i>CTLA-4</i>, <i>PDCD1</i>, <i>HAVCR2</i>, and <i>TIGIT</i> than the low-risk group (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). In summary, we established a novel IPM that could provide new biomarkers for risk stratification of stage I-II LUAD patients.",2021,Gene Expression Omnibus; The Cancer Genome Atlas; immune-related prognostic model; lung adenocarcinoma; oncogenic driver alterations; tumor microenvironment,78

Unlike monogenic disorders, a more complicated series of genetic mutations are believed to be responsible for MPN with various degrees of thromboembolic and bleeding complications. Thrombosis is one of the early manifestations in patients with MPN. To date, the driver genes responsible for MPN include <i>JAK2</i>, <i>CALR</i>, <i>MPL</i>, <i>TET2</i>, <i>ASXL1</i>, and <i>MTHFR</i>. Affords have been done to elucidate these mutations and the incidence of thromboembolic events. Several lines of evidence indicate that mutations in <i>JAK2</i>, <i>MPL</i>, <i>TET2</i> and <i>ASXL1</i> gene and polymorphisms in several clotting factors (<i>GPIa</i>, <i>GPIIa</i>, and <i>GPIIIa</i>) are associated with the occurrence and prevalence of thrombosis in MPN patients.

Thus, we performed a phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) combined with anlotinib for multiple brain metastases (BMs) from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without targetable driver mutations. Patients with multiple BMs (&#x2a7e;3) from NSCLC without targetable driver mutations who failed to respond to at least first-line chemotherapy were enrolled. Eligible patients received WBRT (30&#x2009;Gy/10 f, 5 f/week) and anlotinib (12&#x2009;mg/day, day 1-14 of 21&#x2009;days per cycle, 2 cycles) until disease progression or treatment intolerance. The primary endpoint was intracranial objective response rate (iORR) and secondary endpoints included intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and safety. Between April 2019 and March 2021, 21 patients were enrolled in the trial, of which 12 were aged &#x2a7e;60&#x2009;years (57.1%), 13 were men (61.9%), 7 had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status score of 0 to 1 (81.0%), 18 had adenocarcinoma (85.7%), and 11 had &#x2a7e;6 BMs (52.4%). Of the 21 evaluable patients, the iORR was 66.7% (1 complete response&#x2009;+&#x2009;13 partial response [PR]), and 28.6% (7PR) had extracerebral lesions. The DCRs for intracerebral and extracerebral lesions were 90.5% and 81.0%, respectively. The iPFS and OS were 10.3&#x2009;months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0-24.8&#x2009;months) and 13.4&#x2009;months (95% CI: 0-27.9&#x2009;months), respectively. The most frequently observed toxicities were loss of appetite (61.9%), hypertension (52.4%), fatigue (47.6%), diarrhoea (28.6%), vomiting (19.0%), dizziness (42.9%), and headache (33.3%). None of the patients developed grade 4 or higher grade adverse reactions. Anlotinib combined with WBRT is effective and well tolerated in patients with multiple BMs (&#x2a7e;3) from NSCLC without targetable driver mutations. Therefore, further validation studies are required.Clinical trial registration number: ChiCTR 1900027769.",2022,Whole-brain radiotherapy; anlotinib; brain metastasis; intracranial progression-free survival; non-small cell lung cancer,3

Tumor heterogeneity causes the molecular variety that divergently controls responses to chemotherapy, leading to the recurrent problem of cancer reappearance. For many decades, efforts have focused on identifying essential tumoral genes and cancer driver mutations. More recently, prompted by the clinical success of the synthetic lethality (SL)-based therapy of the PARP inhibitors in homologous recombinant deficient tumors, scientists have centered their novel research on SL interactions (SLI). The state of the art to find new genetic interactions are currently large-scale forward genetic CRISPR screens. CRISPR technology has rapidly evolved to be a common tool in the vast majority of laboratories, as tools to implement CRISPR screen protocols are available to all researchers. Taking advantage of SLI, combinatorial therapies have become the ultimate model to treat cancer with lower toxicity, and therefore better efficiency. This review explores the CRISPR screen methodology, integrates the up-to-date published findings on CRISPR screens in the cancer field and proposes future directions to uncover cancer regulation and individual responses to chemotherapy.",2021,CRISPR screen; cancer therapeutic resistance; combinatorial therapy; synthetic lethality,3

Meanwhile, South Korea has the second-highest incidence rate for CRC in the world. To assess the possible influence of ethnicity on the molecular profile of colorectal cancer, we compared genomic and transcriptomic features of South Korean CRCs with European CRCs. We assembled a genomic and transcriptomic dataset of South Korean CRC patients (KOCRC; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;126) from previous studies and European cases (EUCRC; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;245) selected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Then, we compared the two datasets in terms of clinical data, driver genes, mutational signature, gene sets, consensus molecular subtype, and fusion genes. These two cohorts showed similar profiles in driver mutations but differences in the mutation frequencies of some driver genes (including APC, TP53, PABPC1, FAT4, MUC7, HSPG2, GNAS, DENND5B, and BRAF). Analysis of hallmark pathways using genomic data sets revealed further differences between these populations in the WNT, TP53, and NOTCH signaling pathways. In consensus molecular subtype (CMS) analyses of the study cases, no BRAF mutations were found in the CMS1 subtype of KOCRC, which contrasts with previous findings. Fusion gene analysis identified oncogenic fusion of PTPRK-RSPO3 in a subset of KOCRC patients without APC mutations. This study presents insights into the genomic landscape of KOCRCs and reveals some similarities and differences with EUCRCs at the molecular level.",2022,Colorectal cancer; Ethnicity; European; Genomic landscape; South Korea; Asian People; Colorectal Neoplasms; Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; Humans; Transcriptome,2

Both inflammation and angiogenesis are interconnected with each other in the sense that many pro-inflammatory proteins possess proangiogenic properties and vice versa. To elucidate this interplay further, we present a comparative proteome study of inflammatory and angiogenic activated endothelial cells. HUVEC were stimulated with interleukin 1-&#x3b2; and VEGF, respectively. Cultured primary cells were fractionated into secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions and processed for subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis. Obtained protein profiles were filtered for fraction-specific proteins to address potential cross fractional contamination, subjected to comparative computational biology analysis (GO-Term enrichment analysis, weighted gene co-expression analysis) and compared to published mRNA profiles of IL-1&#x3b2; respectively VEGF stimulated HUVEC. GO Term enrichment analysis and comparative pathway analysis revealed features such as NOD and NfkB signaling for inflammatory activated HUVEC and VEGF and ErB signaling for VEGF-activated HUVEC with potential crosstalk via map kinases MAP2K2. Weighted protein co-expression network analysis revealed several potential hub genes so far not associated with driver function in inflammation or angiogenesis such as HSPG2, ANXA3, and GPI. ""Classical"" inflammation or angiogenesis markers such as IL6, CXCL8 or CST1 were found in a less central position within the co-expression networks. In conclusion, this study reports a framework for the computational biology based analysis of proteomics data applied to cytoplasmic, nucleic and extracellular fractions of quiescent, inflammatory and angiogenic activated HUVEC.

We used models of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced B-cell transformation to document the relevance of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) to regulation of epigenetic-repressive marks during lymphomagenesis. EBV(+) lymphomas and transformed cell lines exhibited abundant expression of PRMT5, a type II PRMT enzyme that promotes transcriptional silencing of target genes by methylating arginine residues on histone tails. PRMT5 expression was limited to EBV-transformed cells, not resting or activated B lymphocytes, validating it as an ideal therapeutic target. We developed a first-in-class, small-molecule PRMT5 inhibitor that blocked EBV-driven B-lymphocyte transformation and survival while leaving normal B cells unaffected. Inhibition of PRMT5 led to lost recruitment of a PRMT5/p65/HDAC3-repressive complex on the miR96 promoter, restored miR96 expression, and PRMT5 downregulation. RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments identified several tumor suppressor genes, including the protein tyrosine phosphatase gene PTPROt, which became silenced during EBV-driven B-cell transformation. Enhanced PTPROt expression following PRMT5 inhibition led to dephosphorylation of kinases that regulate B-cell receptor signaling. We conclude that PRMT5 is critical to EBV-driven B-cell transformation and maintenance of the malignant phenotype, and that PRMT5 inhibition shows promise as a novel therapeutic approach for B-cell lymphomas.",2015,"Animals; B-Lymphocytes; Blotting, Western; Cell Line, Transformed; Cell Transformation, Viral; Cells, Cultured; Enzyme Inhibitors; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Histone Deacetylases; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Lymphoma; Mice, SCID; MicroRNAs; Microscopy, Confocal; Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases; RNA Interference; Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Small Molecule Libraries; Transcription Factor RelA; Transcriptome; Tumor Suppressor Proteins",1

Through a potential synergistic effect, autologous cellular immunotherapy (CIT) composed of cytokine-induced killer (CIK), natural killer (NK), and T cells might enhance it. NK cells exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity toward lung cancer cells (A549 cells) following platinum therapy. Using flow cytometry, the expression of MICA, MICB, DR4, DR5, CD112, and CD155 on lung cancer cells was assessed. In this retrospective cohort study, there were included 102 previously untreated stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients ineligible for tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) target therapy who received either chemotherapy alone (n=75) or combination therapy (n=27). The cytotoxicity of NK cells for A549 cells was increased obviously and a time-dependent enhancement of this effect was also observed. After platinum therapy, the levels of MICA, MICB, DR4, DR5, CD112, and CD155 on the surface of A549 cells were increased. In the combination group, the median PFS was 8.3 months, compared to 5.5 months in the control group (p=0.042); the median overall survival was 18.00 months, compared to 13.67 months in the combined group (p=0.003). The combination group had no obvious immune-related adverse effects. The combination of NK cells with platinum showed synergistic anticancer effects. Combining the two strategies increased survival with minor adverse effects. Incorporating CIT into conventional chemotherapy regimens may improve NSCLC treatment.

Mutations in KRAS and TP53 along with some other frequent polymorphisms occur almost universally and are likely to be responsible for tumor initiation. However, these mutations cannot explain the heterogeneity in therapeutic responses observed in PDAC patients, which limits efficiency of current therapeutic strategies. Instead, recent classifications of PDAC tumor samples are based on transcriptomics data and thus include information about epigenetic, transcriptomic, and post-transcriptomic deregulations. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are important post-transcriptional regulators involved in every aspect of the RNA life cycle and thus considerably influence the transcriptome. In this study, we systematically investigated deregulated expression, prognostic value, and essentiality reported for RBPs in PDAC or PDAC cancer models using publicly available data. We identified 44 RBPs with suggested oncogenic potential. These include various proteins, e.g., IGF2 mRNA binding proteins (IGF2BPs), with reported tumor-promoting roles. We further characterized these RBPs and found common patterns regarding their expression, interaction, and regulation by microRNAs.

This study aimed to provide information on the influences of these mutations. The study assessed 36 protein expression profiles of lung adenocarcinoma (Ex19del, nine; L858R, nine; no Ex19del/L858R, 18). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis together with analysis of variance-based screening identified 13 co-expressed modules and their eigen proteins. Pathway enrichment analysis for the Ex19del mutation demonstrated involvement of SUMOylation, epithelial and mesenchymal transition, ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling via phosphorylation and Hippo signalling. Additionally, analysis for the L858R mutation identified various pathways related to cancer cell survival and death. With regard to the Ex19del mutation, ROCK, RPS6KA1, ARF1, IL2RA and several ErbB pathways were upregulated, whereas AURK and GSKIP were downregulated. With regard to the L858R mutation, RB1, TSC22D3 and DOCK1 were downregulated, whereas various networks, including VEGFA, were moderately upregulated.

Great efforts on protein-coding cancer drivers have yielded fruitful discoveries and clinical applications. However, investigations on cancer drivers in non-coding regions, especially long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), are extremely scarce due to the limitation of functional understanding. Thus, to identify driver lncRNAs integrating multi-omics data in human cancers, we proposed a computational framework, DriverLncNet, which dissected the functional impact of somatic copy number alteration (CNA) of lncRNAs on regulatory networks and captured key functional effectors in dys-regulatory networks. Applying it to 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we portrayed the landscape of 117 driver lncRNAs and revealed their associated cancer hallmarks through their functional effectors. Moreover, lncRNA RP11-571M6.8 was detected to be highly associated with immunotherapeutic targets (PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4) and regulatory T&#xa0;cell infiltration level and their markers (IL2RA and FCGR2B) in glioblastoma multiforme, highlighting its immunosuppressive function. Meanwhile, a high expression of RP11-1020A11.1 in bladder carcinoma was predictive of poor survival independent of clinical characteristics, and CTD-2256P15.2 in lung adenocarcinoma responded to the sensitivity of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) inhibitors. In summary, this study provided a framework to decipher the mechanisms of tumorigenesis from driver lncRNA level, established a new landscape of driver lncRNAs in human cancers, and offered potential clinical implications for precision oncology.",2020,cancer drivers; cancer hallmarks; copy number alterations; immunosuppression; long non-coding RNAs,4

T cells proliferate for up to 6 days following a 30 minute incubation with these IL-2 mutants, which may lead to potential applications for cancer and viral immunotherapy. Several alternative mechanisms have been proposed to explain the contrasting effects of IL-2 and IL-15 on T cell proliferation and death. These IL-2 mutants exhibit T cell growth response-receptor occupancy curves indistinguishable from that for IL-15, suggesting that much of the difference between wild-type IL-2 and IL-15 effects arises simply from their 1000-fold differing affinities for their private alpha receptor subunits.",2005,"Amino Acid Substitution; Cell Line; Cell Membrane; Cell Proliferation; Directed Molecular Evolution; Humans; Interleukin-15; Interleukin-2; Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit; Lymphocyte Activation; Mitogens; Protein Binding; Receptors, Interleukin; Receptors, Interleukin-15; Receptors, Interleukin-2; T-Lymphocytes",4

Much of the knowledge of the genetics of BL thus far has originated from the study of pediatric BL (pBL), leaving its relationship to adult BL (aBL) and other adult lymphomas not fully explored. We sought to more thoroughly identify the somatic changes that underlie lymphomagenesis in aBL and any molecular features that associate with clinical disparities within and between pBL and aBL. Through comprehensive whole-genome sequencing of 230 BL and 295 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors, we identified additional significantly mutated genes, including more genetic features that associate with tumor Epstein-Barr virus status, and unraveled new distinct subgroupings within BL and DLBCL with 3 predominantly comprising BLs: DGG-BL (DDX3X, GNA13, and GNAI2), IC-BL (ID3 and CCND3), and Q53-BL (quiet TP53). Each BL subgroup is characterized by combinations of common driver and noncoding mutations caused by aberrant somatic hypermutation. The largest subgroups of BL cases, IC-BL and DGG-BL, are further characterized by distinct biological and gene expression differences. IC-BL and DGG-BL and their prototypical genetic features (ID3 and TP53) had significant associations with patient outcomes that were different among aBL and pBL cohorts. These findings highlight shared pathogenesis between aBL and pBL, and establish genetic subtypes within BL that serve to delineate tumors with distinct molecular features, providing a new framework for epidemiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies.",2023,"Child; Humans; Adult; Burkitt Lymphoma; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse; Mutation",2
24423449,GNAI2,10.1186/1757-2215-7-6,Suppression of GNAI2 message in ovarian cancer.,"Understanding the integration of hormone signaling and how it impacts oncogenesis is critical for improved cancer treatments. Here we elucidate GNAI2 message alterations in ovarian cancer (OvCa). GNAI2 is a heterotrimeric G protein which couples cell surface hormone receptors to intracellular enzymes, and is best characterized for its direct role in regulating cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) function by decreasing intracellular cAMP through inhibiting adenylyl cyclase. We probed the Origene human OvCa array for the presence of polymorphisms and gene expression alterations of GNAI2 using directing sequencing and qPCR. These data were supported by database mining of the [NCBI NIH GSE:6008, GSE:14764, GSE:29450, GDS:4066, GDS:3297, GSE:32474, and GSE:2003] datasets. No significant polymorphisms were found, including an absence of the gip2 oncogene. However, 85.9% of (506 of 589) OvCa patients had decreased GNAI2 message. Further characterization demonstrated that the GNAI2 message was on average decreased 54% and maximally decreased by 2.8 fold in clear cell carcinoma. GNAI2 message decreased in early stage cancer while message was increased compared to normal in advanced cancers. The changes in GNAI2 also correlated to deregulation of CREB, Fos, Myc, cyclins, Arf, the transition from estrogen dependence to independence, and metastatic potential. These data strongly implicate GNAI2 as a critical regulator of oncogenesis and an upstream driver of cancer progression in OvCa.",2015,"Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma; Data Mining; Databases, Genetic; Down-Regulation; Female; GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunit, Gi2; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Neoplasm Staging; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Ovarian Neoplasms; RNA, Messenger; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome",2

32508023,HK3,10.1002/ctm2.6,HK3 is correlated with immune infiltrates and predicts response to immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.,"With the knowledge of tumor immunobiology deepening among researchers, the breakthroughs in the field of tumor immunotherapy in recent years have provided new approaches for cancer therapy. While patients who receive treatment are all at risk of side effects, about one-fifth of them have sustained responses. It is crucial to figure out the underlying mechanism of how the immune system regulates the nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) microenvironment to improve the benefit of immunotherapy. Regarding glucose metabolism, the initial step is to generate glucose-6-phosphate by phosphorylating glucose with hexokinases-3 (HK3). According to a recent study, HK3 has a functional role in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia and colorectal cancer. Here, we studied the co-expression relationship between the glycolytic pathway gene and the immune checkpoint gene and found that the expression of HK3 in tumor tissues may be related to immune status. By analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, we found that the expression of HK3 was closely related to the main clinical features as well as to molecular characteristics. We also predicted that cases with low expression of HK3 were usually malignant entities and were shown to be obvious genomic aberrations of driver oncogenes. At the same time, gene ontology analysis based on significantly related genes in HK3 expression showed that HK3 expression was linked to inflammatory activity and immune response. Additionally, HK3 showed a remarkable trend in predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy for patients receiving Keytruda (PD-1 monoclonal antibody) treatment. This is the first comprehensive study to characterize HK3 expression in NSCLC from molecular and clinical aspects.",2021,HK3; NSCLC; immune infiltrates; immunotherapy,3

Current research strongly supports the notion that inhibition of aberrant tumor metabolism holds promise as a therapeutic strategy when used in combination with radiation and chemotherapy. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) has been shown to be a key driver of altered metabolism in GBM, and presents an attractive therapeutic target. To date, no study has fully assessed the therapeutic value of targeting HK2 as a mechanism to sensitize cells to standard therapy, namely in the form of radiation and temozolomide (TMZ). Using cell lines and primary cultures of GBM, we showed that inducible knockdown of HK2 altered tumor metabolism, which could not be recapitulated by HK1 or HK3 loss. HK2 loss diminished both in vivo tumor vasculature as well as growth within orthotopic intracranial xenograft models of GBMs, and the survival benefit was additive with radiation and TMZ. Radio-sensitization following inhibition of HK2 was mediated by increased DNA damage, and could be rescued through constitutive activation of ERK signaling.

Our goal was to evaluate the correlation between mutation in the commonly mutated tumor suppressor gene TP53 and metabolism. We established a database comprising mutation and RNA-seq expression data of the TCGA repository and performed receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to compare expression of each gene between TP53 mutated and wild type samples. All together 762 breast cancer samples were evaluated of which 215 had TP53 mutation. Top up-regulated metabolic genes include glycolytic enzymes (e.g. HK3, GPI, GAPDH, PGK1, ENO1), glycolysis regulator (PDK1) and pentose phosphate pathway enzymes (PGD, TKT, RPIA). Gluconeogenesis enzymes (G6PC3, FBP1) were down-regulated. Oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates were measured in TP53 wild type and mutant breast cell lines with a microfluorimetric analyzer. Applying metabolic inhibitors in the presence and absence of D-glucose and L-glutamine in cell culture experiments resulted in higher glycolytic and mitochondrial activity in TP53 mutant breast cancer cell lines. In summary, TP53 mutation influences energy metabolism at multiple levels. Our results provide evidence for the synergistic activation of multiple hallmarks linking to these the mutation status of a key driver gene.",2018,"Warburg effect; breast cancer; glycolytic efficiency; next generation sequencing; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Energy Metabolism; Female; Humans; Mutation; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53",3

36897988,SIGLEC7,10.1073/pnas.2215376120,MYC-driven synthesis of Siglec ligands is a glycoimmune checkpoint.,"The Siglecs (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins) are glycoimmune checkpoint receptors that suppress immune cell activation upon engagement of cognate sialoglycan ligands. The cellular drivers underlying Siglec ligand production on cancer cells are poorly understood. We find the <i>MYC</i> oncogene causally regulates Siglec ligand production to enable tumor immune evasion. A combination of glycomics and RNA-sequencing of mouse tumors revealed the <i>MYC</i> oncogene controls expression of the sialyltransferase <i>St6galnac4</i> and induces a glycan known as disialyl-T. Using in&#xa0;vivo models and primary human leukemias, we find that disialyl-T functions as a ""don't eat me"" signal by engaging macrophage Siglec-E in mice or the human ortholog Siglec-7, thereby preventing cancer cell clearance. Combined high expression of <i>MYC</i> and <i>ST6GALNAC4</i> identifies patients with high-risk cancers and reduced tumor myeloid infiltration. MYC therefore regulates glycosylation to enable tumor immune evasion. We conclude that disialyl-T is a glycoimmune checkpoint ligand. Thus, disialyl-T is a candidate for antibody-based checkpoint blockade, and the disialyl-T synthase ST6GALNAC4 is a potential enzyme target for small molecule-mediated immune therapy.",2023,"MYC; Siglec; glycosylation; oncogene; Animals; Humans; Mice; Antigens, CD; Ligands; Macrophages; Neoplasms; Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc",1

Its initial presentation as primary disease (pGBM) has been subject to exhaustive molecular and cellular profiling. By contrast, our understanding of how GBM evolves to evade the selective pressure of therapy is starkly limited. The proteomic landscape of recurrent GBM (rGBM), which is refractory to most treatments used for pGBM, are poorly known. We, therefore, quantified the transcriptome and proteome of 134 patient-derived pGBM and rGBM samples, including 40 matched pGBM-rGBM pairs. GBM subtypes transition from pGBM to rGBM towards a preferentially mesenchymal state at recurrence, consistent with the increasingly invasive nature of rGBM. We identified immune regulatory/suppressive genes as important drivers of rGBM and in particular 2-5-oligoadenylate synthase 2 (OAS2) as an essential gene in recurrent disease. Our data identify a new class of therapeutic targets that emerge from the adaptive response of pGBM to therapy, emerging specifically in recurrent disease and may provide new therapeutic opportunities absent at pGBM diagnosis.",2022,"Glioblastoma; Immunosuppression; OAS2; Proteomics; Humans; Glioblastoma; Brain Neoplasms; Proteomics; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Transcriptome",1

We developed a LSD1/HDAC6 multitargeting inhibitor (iDual), a hydroxamic acid analogue of the clinical candidate LSD1 inhibitor GSK2879552. iDual inhibits both targets with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 540, 110, and 290 nM, respectively, against LSD1, HDAC6, and HDAC8. We compared its activity to structurally similar control probes that act by HDAC or LSD1 inhibition alone, as well as an inactive null compound. iDual inhibited the growth of leukemia cell lines at a higher level than GSK2879552 with micromolar IC<sub>50</sub> values. Dual engagement with LSD1 and HDAC6 was supported by dose dependent increases in substrate levels, biomarkers, and cellular thermal shift assay. Both histone methylation and acetylation of tubulin were increased, while acetylated histone levels were only mildly affected, indicating selectivity for HDAC6. Downstream gene expression (CD11b, CD86, p21) was also elevated in response to iDual treatment. Remarkably, iDual synergized with doxorubicin, triggering significant levels of apoptosis with a sublethal concentration of the drug. While mechanistic studies did not reveal changes in DNA repair or drug efflux pathways, the expression of AGPAT9, ALOX5, BTG1, HIPK2, IFI44L, and LRP1, previously implicated in doxorubicin sensitivity, was significantly elevated.",2022,acute myeloid leukemia; combination therapy; epigenetics; histone deacetylases (HDACs); lysine demethylases (KMDs); multitargeting,9

Whereas the metastatic melanoma was responsive to ICB, the CLL rapidly progressed (but responded to ICB cessation and ibrutinib). There were no new genetic mutational drivers to explain the altered clinical course.

To explore the possible involvement of this mechanism in promoting systemic immunosuppression, the pre-treatment levels of soluble co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory immune checkpoint molecules, as well as those of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were measured in 98 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and compared with those of 45 healthy controls using multiplex bead array and ELISA technologies. Plasma concentrations of the co-stimulatory immune checkpoints, GITR, GITRL, CD27, CD28, CD40, CD80, CD86 and ICOS, as well as the co-inhibitory molecules, PD-L1, CTLA-4 and TIM-3, were all significantly lower in early breast cancer patients compared to healthy controls, as were those of HVEM and sTLR-2, whereas the plasma concentrations of CX3CL1 (fractalkine), CCL5 (RANTES) and those of the growth factors, M-CSF, FGF-21 and GDF-15 were significantly increased. However, when analyzed according to the patients' breast cancer characteristics, these being triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) vs. non-TNBC, tumor size, stage, nodal status and age, no significant differences were detected between the plasma levels of the various immune checkpoint molecules, cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Additionally, none of these biomarkers correlated with pathological complete response. This study has identified low plasma levels of soluble co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules in newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer patients compared to healthy controls, which is a novel finding seemingly consistent with a state of systemic immune dysregulation.

This study aimed to provide information on the influences of these mutations. The study assessed 36 protein expression profiles of lung adenocarcinoma (Ex19del, nine; L858R, nine; no Ex19del/L858R, 18). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis together with analysis of variance-based screening identified 13 co-expressed modules and their eigen proteins. Pathway enrichment analysis for the Ex19del mutation demonstrated involvement of SUMOylation, epithelial and mesenchymal transition, ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling via phosphorylation and Hippo signalling. Additionally, analysis for the L858R mutation identified various pathways related to cancer cell survival and death. With regard to the Ex19del mutation, ROCK, RPS6KA1, ARF1, IL2RA and several ErbB pathways were upregulated, whereas AURK and GSKIP were downregulated. With regard to the L858R mutation, RB1, TSC22D3 and DOCK1 were downregulated, whereas various networks, including VEGFA, were moderately upregulated. In all mutation types, CD80/CD86 (B7), MHC, CIITA and IFGN were activated, whereas CD37 and SAFB were inhibited.

Fourty percent of all melanomas harbor a mutation in the signaling adaptor BRAF (V600E) that results in ERK hyperactivity as an oncogenic driver. In these cases, treatment with the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitors Vemurafenib (VEM) or Dabrafenib (DAB) coapplied with the MEK1/2 inhibitors Cobimetinib (COB) or Trametinib (TRA) can result in long-term suppression of tumor growth. Besides direct suppression of ERK activity, these inhibitors have been reported to also modulate tumor immune responses, and exert pro-inflammatory side effects such as fever and rash in some patients. Here we asked for potential effects of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitors on dendritic cells (DC) which are essential for the induction of adaptive anti-tumor responses. Both splenic and bone marrow-derived (BM) mouse dendritic cells (DC) up-regulated costimulator expression (CD80, CD86) in response to DAB but not VEM treatment. Moreover, DAB and to lesser extent VEM enhanced IL-1&#x3b2; (interleukin 1 beta) release by splenic DC, and by LPS-stimulated BMDC. We demonstrate that DAB and VEM activated the NLRC4/Caspase-1 inflammasome. At high concentration, DAB also induced inflammasome activation independent of Caspase-1. TRA and COB elevated MHCII expression on BMDC, and modulated the LPS-induced cytokine pattern. Immunomodulatory activity of DAB and VEM was also observed in human monocyte-derived DC, and DAB induced IL-1&#x3b2; in human primary DC. Altogether, our study shows that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitors upregulate IL-1&#x3b2; release by mouse and human DC which may affect the DC-mediated course of anti-tumor immune responses.",2019,BRAFV600E inhibitor; IL-1beta; Immunology; MEK inhibitor; dendritic cell; inflammasome,9

In this study, we explored the contributions of macrophage-expressed lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) to tumor formation in a K-Ras murine model of lung carcinoma. Myeloid-specific deletion of LDH-A promoted accumulation of macrophages with a CD86<sup>high</sup> and MCP-1<sup>high</sup> M1-like phenotype that suppressed tumor growth. This phenotypic effect was accompanied by reduced VEGF expression and angiogenesis, diminished numbers of PD-L1<sup>+</sup> cancer cells, increased numbers of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, and activation status of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, it was associated with more pronounced antitumor T-cell immunity via induction of IL17 and IFN&#x3b3;-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T (Tc17 and Tc1) cells, likely via suppression of lactate-driven PD-L1 expression. Our results suggest that expressions of LDH-A and lactate by macrophage in the tumor microenvironment are major drivers of T-cell immunosuppression, strongly supporting the concept of targeting stromal LDH-A as an effective strategy to blunt tumoral immune escape. <i>Cancer Res; 77(13); 3632-43. &#xa9;2017 AACR</i>.",2017,"Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Humans; Isoenzymes; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lactate Dehydrogenase 5; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Myeloid Cells; Tumor Microenvironment",9

We still have no understanding on why only some DCIS lesions evolve to invasive cancer whereas others appear not to do so during the life span of the patient. Here, we performed full exome (tumor vs. matching normal), transcriptome, and methylome analysis of 30 pure high-grade DCIS (HG-DCIS) and 10 normal breast epithelial samples. Sixty-two percent of HG-DCIS cases displayed mutations affecting cancer driver genes or potential drivers. Mutations were observed affecting PIK3CA (21% of cases), TP53 (17%), GATA3 (7%), MLL3 (7%) and single cases of mutations affecting CDH1, MAP2K4, TBX3, NF1, ATM, and ARID1A. Significantly, 83% of lesions displayed numerous large chromosomal copy number alterations, suggesting they might precede selection of cancer driver mutations. Integrated pathway-based modeling analysis of RNA-seq data allowed us to identify two DCIS subgroups (DCIS-C1 and DCIS-C2) based on their tumor-intrinsic subtypes, proliferative, immune scores, and in the activity of specific signaling pathways. The more aggressive DCIS-C1 (highly proliferative, basal-like, or ERBB2(+)) displayed signatures characteristic of activated Treg cells (CD4(+)/CD25(+)/FOXP3(+)) and CTLA4(+)/CD86(+) complexes indicative of a tumor-associated immunosuppressive phenotype. Strikingly, all lesions showed evidence of TP53 pathway inactivation. Similarly, ncRNA and methylation profiles reproduce changes observed postinvasion. Among the most significant findings, we observed upregulation of lncRNA HOTAIR in DCIS-C1 lesions and hypermethylation of HOXA5 and SOX genes.

Genetic alterations underlying cancer cell-intrinsic oncogenic signaling are increasingly appreciated for their role in shaping the immune landscape. Recently, we identified Pygopus 2 (<i>PYGO2</i>) as the driver oncogene for the amplicon at 1q21.3 in prostate cancer. Here, using transgenic mouse models of metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma, we found that <i>Pygo2</i> deletion decelerated tumor progression, diminished metastases, and extended survival. Pygo2 loss augmented the activation and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and sensitized tumor cells to T cell killing. Mechanistically, Pygo2 orchestrated a p53/Sp1/Kit/Ido1 signaling network to foster a microenvironment hostile to CTLs. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Pygo2 enhanced the antitumor efficacy of immunotherapies using immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), adoptive cell transfer, or agents inhibiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells. In human prostate cancer samples, Pygo2 expression was inversely correlated with the infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Analysis of the ICB clinical data showed association between high <i>PYGO2</i> level and worse outcome.

The acquisition and selection of genomic alterations may be critical to understanding the initiation and progression of this disease. In this study, we have systematically characterized the clonal architecture of 97 driver genes in 536 colorectal cancer patients from TCGA. A high proportion of clonal mutations in 93 driver genes were observed. 40 genes showed significant associations between their clonality and multiple clinicopathologic factors. Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that the mutation clonality of ANK1, CASP8, SMAD2, and ARID1A had a significant impact on the CRC patients' outcomes. Multivariable analysis revealed that subclonal ANK1 mutations, clonal CASP8 mutations, and clonal SMAD2 mutations independently predicted for shorter overall survival after adjusting for clinicopathological factors. The poor outcome of the subclonal ANK1 mutation may be caused by upregulation of IL4I1, IDO1, IFNG and MAPK12 which showed potential roles in tumor immune evasion through accumulation of immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells. These results suggested that the clonality of driver genes could act as prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets in human colorectal cancer.",2022,Clonal mutation; Colorectal cancer; Driver genes; Immune evasion; Prognostic biomarkers; Subclonal mutation; Colorectal Neoplasms; Genomics; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; L-Amino Acid Oxidase; Mutation,17

A key driver of CRC development is colon inflammatory responses especially in patients with inflammatory bowl disease (IBD). It has been proved that Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-tumor effects. The chemopreventive and immunomodulatory functions of PNS on colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) have not been evaluated.This present study was designed to study the potential protective effects of PNS on AOM/DSS-induced CAC mice to explore the possible mechanism of PNS against CAC. Our study showed that PNS significantly alleviated colitis severity and prevented the occurrence of CAC. Functional assays revealed that PNS relieved immunosuppression of Treg cells in the CAC microenvironment by inhibiting the expression of IDO1 mediated directly by signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) rather than phosphorylated STAT1. Ultimately, Rh1, one of the PNS metabolites, exhibited the best inhibitory effect on IDO1 enzyme activity. Our study showed that PNS exerted significant chemopreventive function and immunomodulatory properties on CAC. It could reduce macrophages accumulation and Treg cells differentiation to reshape the immune microenvironment of CAC. These findings provided a promising approach for CAC intervention.",2022,Chemoprevention; Colitis-associated colorectal cancer; IDO1; Panax notoginseng saponins; Treg cells; Animals; Colitis; Colitis-Associated Neoplasms; Humans; Macrophages; Mice; Panax notoginseng; Saponins; Tumor Microenvironment,17

However, its transcriptomic characteristics associated with immunological signatures, driver fusions, and recurrence markers remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the transcriptomic characteristics of advanced papillary thyroid cancer. This study included 282 papillary thyroid cancer tumor samples and 155 normal samples from Chungnam National University Hospital and Seoul National University Hospital. Transcriptomic quantification was determined by high-throughput RNA sequencing. We investigated the associations of clinical parameters and molecular signatures using RNA sequencing. We validated predictive biomarkers using the Cancer Genome Atlas database. Through a comparison of differentially expressed genes, gene sets, and pathways in papillary thyroid cancer compared to normal tumor-adjacent tissue, we found increased immune signaling associated with cytokines or T cells and decreased thyroid hormone synthetic pathways. In addition, patients with recurrence presented increased CD8+ T-cell and Th1-cell signatures. Interestingly, we found differentially overexpressed genes related to immune-escape signaling such as CTLA4, IDO1, LAG3, and PDCD1 in advanced papillary thyroid cancer with a low thyroid differentiation score. Fusion analysis showed that the PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways were regulated differently according to the RET fusion partner genes (CCDC6 or NCOA4). Finally, we identified HOXD9 as a novel molecular biomarker that predicts the recurrence of thyroid cancer in addition to known risk factors (tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and extrathyroidal extension). We identified a high association with immune-escape signaling in the immune-hot group with aggressive clinical characteristics among Korean thyroid cancer patients. Moreover, RET fusion differentially regulated PI3K and MAPK signaling depending on the partner gene of RET, and HOXD9 was found to be a recurrence marker for advanced papillary thyroid cancer.",2022,Advanced Papillary Thyroid Cancer; Fusion Outlier; Immune Subtyping; Immune-Escape Signaling; Korean Thyroid Cancer; RNA Sequencing; Thyroid Cancer,17

A driver of fibrosis is the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway, and Kyn metabolism patterns and cytokines may influence cGVHD severity and manifestation (fibrosing versus gastrointestinal [GI] cGVHD). Using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach on sera obtained from 425 patients with allografts, we identified high CXCL9, high indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity, and an activated Kyn pathway as common characteristics in all cGVHD subtypes. Specific Kyn metabolism patterns could be identified for non-severe cGVHD, severe GI cGVHD, and fibrosing cGVHD, respectively. Specifically, fibrosing cGVHD was associated with a distinct pathway shift toward anthranilic and kynurenic acid, correlating with reduced activity of the vitamin-B2-dependent kynurenine monooxygenase, low vitamin B6, and increased interleukin-18.

To systematically evaluate the determinants of immune response in CRC, we explored whether patients with diverse levels of immune cytolytic activity (CYT) have different patterns of chromothripsis and kataegis. Analysis of CRC genomic data from the TCGA, indicated an excess of chromothriptic clusters among CYT-low colon adenocarcinomas, affecting known cancer drivers (<i>APC, KRAS, BRAF, TP53</i> and <i>FBXW7</i>), immune checkpoints (<i>CD274, PDCD1LG2, IDO1/2</i> and <i>LAG3</i>) and immune-related genes (<i>ENTPD1, PRF1, NKG7, FAS, GZMA/B/H/K</i> and <i>CD73</i>). CYT-high tumors were characterized by hypermutation, enrichment in APOBEC-associated mutations and kataegis events, as well as APOBEC activation. We also assessed differences in the most prevalent mutational signatures (SBS15, SBS20, SBS54 and DBS2) across cytolytic subgroups. Regarding the composition of immune cells in the tumor milieu, we found enrichment of M1 macrophages, CD8+ T cells and Tregs, as well as higher CD8+ T-cells/Tregs ratio among CYT-high tumors. CYT-high patients had higher immunophenoscores, which is predictive of their responsiveness if they were to be treated with anti-PD-1 alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 drugs.

A hallmark of DM is an increased risk for developing breast, ovarian, and lung cancer. Since autoantibodies against anti-TIF-1-&#x3b3;, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, has a strong association with malignancy, we examined expression of the TRIM gene family to identify pathways that may be contributing to DM pathogenesis. We employed the Search Tag Analyze Resource for GEO platform to search the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus to elucidate TRIM family gene expression as well as oncogenic drivers in DM pathology. We conducted meta-analysis of the data from human skin (60 DM vs 34 healthy) and muscle (71 DM vs 22 healthy). We identified genes involved in innate immunity, antigen presentation, metabolism, and other cellular processes as facilitators of DM disease activity and confirmed previous observations regarding the presence of a robust interferon signature. Moreover, analysis of DM muscle samples revealed upregulation of TRIM14, TRIM22, TRIM25, TRIM27, and TRIM38. Likewise, analysis of DM skin samples showed upregulation of TRIM5, TRIM6, TRIM 14, TRIM21, TRIM34, and TRIM38 and downregulation of TRIM73. Additionally, we noted upregulation of oncogenes IGLC1, IFI44, POSTN, MYC, NPM1, and IDO1 and related this change to interferon signaling. While the clinical data associated with genetic data that was analyzed did not contain clinical data regarding malignancy in these cohorts, the observed genetic changes may be associated with homeostatic and signaling changes that relate to the increased risk in malignancy in DM.

We investigated drivers of cancer-related immunosuppression across NETs of various sites and grades using multi-parameter immunohistochemistry and targeted transcriptomic profiling. Tissue microarrays (n = 102) were stained for PD-L1 and 2 and indoleamine deoxygenase-1 (IDO-1) and evaluated in relationship to functional characteristics of tumour-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs) and biomarkers of hypoxia/angiogenesis.

Here, we explore the association of chemokine expression with effector T-cell infiltration in PDAC. Discovery cohorts comprised 113 primary resected PDAC and 107 PDAC liver metastases. Validation cohorts comprised 182 PDAC from The Cancer Genome Atlas and 92 PDACs from the Australian International Cancer Genome Consortium. We explored associations between immune cell counts by immunohistochemistry, chemokine expression, and transcriptional hallmarks of antitumor immunity by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and mutational burden by whole-genome sequencing.

Furthermore, the 4-chemokine signature marked tumors with increased T-cell activation scores (MHC I presentation, T-cell/APC costimulation) and elevated expression of innate immune sensing pathways involved in T-cell priming (STING and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways, BATF3-driven dendritic cells). Importantly, expression of this 4-chemokine signature was consistently indicative of a T-cell-inflamed phenotype across primary PDAC and PDAC liver metastases.

Our aim was to examine how the immune landscape relates to different aspects of the CRC's biology, including neoepitope burden. We used TCGA data to stratify patients based on a cytolytic T-cell activity expression index and correlated immune cytolytic activity (CYT) with mutational, structural, and neoepitope features of each tumor sample. The expression of several immune checkpoints was verified in an independent cohort of 72 CRC patients, relative to their MSI status, using immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR. CRC exhibits a range of intertumoral cytolytic T-cell activity, with lower cytolytic levels in the tumor, compared to the normal tissue. We separated CRC patients into CYT-high and CYT-low subgroups. High cytolytic activity correlated with increased mutational load in colon tumors, the count of MHC-I/-II classically defined and alternatively defined neoepitopes, high microsatellite instability and deregulated expression of several inhibitory immune checkpoints (VISTA, TIGIT, PD-1, IDO1, CTLA-4, and PD-L1, among others). Many immune checkpoint molecules (IDO1, LAG3, TIGIT, VISTA, PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4) expressed significantly higher in MSI+ CRCs compared to MSS tumors. The expression of Treg markers was also significantly higher in CYT-high tumors. Both individual and simultaneous high levels of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 had a positive effect on the patients' overall survival. On the reverse, simultaneous low expression of both genes led to a significant shift towards negative effect. Assessed globally, CYT-low CRCs contained more recurrent somatic copy number alterations. PD-L1 protein was absent in most samples in the independent cohort and stained lowly in 33% of MSI CRCs. PD-L1+ CRCs stained moderately for CD8 and weakly for FOXP3. CYT-high colon tumors had higher TIL load, whereas CYT-high rectum tumors had higher TAN load compared to their CYT-low counterparts. Overall, we highlight the link between different genetic events and the immune microenvironment in CRC, taking into consideration the status of microsatellite instability.

Unlike cutaneous disease, uveal melanoma does not exhibit RAS mutations but instead contains mutations with ~90% penetrance in either G&#x3b1;<sub>q</sub> or G&#x3b1;<sub>11</sub>. Previously we demonstrated that neratinib caused ERBB1/2/4 and RAS internalization into autolysosomes which resulted in their proteolytic degradation. In PDX isolates of uveal melanoma, neratinib caused the internalization and degradation of G&#x3b1;<sub>q</sub> and G&#x3b1;<sub>11</sub> in parallel with ERBB1 breakdown. These effects were enhanced by the HDAC inhibitor entinostat. Similar data were obtained using GFP/RFP tagged forms of K-RAS V12. Down regulation of G&#x3b1;<sub>q</sub> and G&#x3b1;<sub>11</sub> expression and RAS-GFP/RFP fluorescence required Beclin1 and ATG5. The [neratinib + entinostat] combination engaged multiple pathways to mediate killing. One was from ROS-dependent activation of ATM via AMPK-ULK1-ATG13-Beclin1/ATG5. Another pathway was from CD95 via caspase 8-RIP1/RIP3. A third was from reduced expression of HSP70, HSP90, HDAC6 and phosphorylation of eIF2&#x3b1;. Downstream of the mitochondrion both caspase 9 and AIF played roles in tumor cell execution. Knock down of ATM/AMPK/ULK-1 prevented ATG13 phosphorylation and degradation of RAS and G&#x3b1; proteins. Over-expression of activated mTOR prevented ATG13 phosphorylation and suppressed killing. Knock down of eIF2&#x3b1; maintained BCL-XL and MCL-1 expression. Within 6h, [neratinib + entinostat] reduced the expression of the immunology biomarkers PD-L1, ODC, IDO-1 and enhanced MHCA levels.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression may be a driver of immune suppression in melanoma, but the mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here, we show that COX-2 expression drives constitutive expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in human tumor cells. IDO1 is an immunosuppressive enzyme that degrades tryptophan. In a series of seven human tumor lines, constitutive IDO1 expression depends on COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>), which, upon autocrine signaling through the EP receptor, activates IDO1 via the PKC and PI3K pathways. COX-2 expression itself depends on the MAPK pathway, which therefore indirectly controls IDO1 expression. Most of these tumors carry PI3K or MAPK oncogenic mutations, which may favor constitutive IDO1 expression. Celecoxib treatment promoted immune rejection of IDO1-expressing human tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice reconstituted with human allogeneic lymphocytes. This effect was associated with a reduced expression of IDO1 in those ovarian SKOV3 tumors and an increased infiltration of CD3<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells. Our results highlight the role of COX-2 in constitutive IDO1 expression by human tumors and substantiate the use of COX-2 inhibitors to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, by reducing constitutive IDO1 expression, which contributes to the lack of T-cell infiltration in ""cold"" tumors, which fail to respond to immunotherapy. <i>Cancer Immunol Res; 5(8); 695-709. &#xa9;2017 AACR</i>.",2018,"Animals; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Celecoxib; Cell Line, Tumor; Cyclooxygenase 2; Dinoprostone; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase; Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating; Mice; Ovarian Neoplasms; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",17

However, mechanisms that regulate TI humoral immunity are poorly defined. In this study, we report that B cell-intrinsic induction of the tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme IDO1 is a key mechanism limiting TI Ab responses. When Ido1(-/-) mice were immunized with TI Ags, there was a significant increase in Ab titers and formation of extrafollicular Ab-secreting cells compared with controls. This effect was specific to TI Ags, as Ido1 disruption did not affect Ig production after immunization with protein Ags. The effect of IDO1 abrogation was confined to the B cell compartment, as adoptive transfer of Ido1(-/-) B cells to B cell-deficient mice was sufficient to replicate increased TI responses observed in Ido1(-/-) mice. Moreover, in vitro activation with TLR ligands or BCR crosslinking rapidly induced Ido1 expression and activity in purified B cells, and Ido1(-/-) B cells displayed enhanced proliferation and cell survival associated with increased Ig and cytokine production compared with wild-type B cells. Thus, our results demonstrate a novel, B cell-intrinsic, role for IDO1 as a regulator of humoral immunity that has implications for both vaccine design and prevention of autoimmunity.",2015,"Adoptive Transfer; Animals; Antibody Formation; Antigens, T-Independent; Apoptosis; B-Lymphocytes; Blotting, Western; Cell Proliferation; Female; Flow Cytometry; Immunity, Humoral; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-6; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Microscopy, Confocal; Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell",17

Specific aspects of altered tumor metabolism may be amenable to therapeutic intervention and could be coordinated with other targeted therapies. In breast cancer, the genetic landscape has been defined most comprehensively in efforts such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). However, little is known about how alterations of tumor metabolism correlate with this landscape. In total 25 cancers (23 fully analyzed by TCGA) and 5 normal breast specimens were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, quantitating 399 identifiable metabolites. We found strong differences correlated with hormone receptor status with 18% of the metabolites elevated in estrogen receptor negative (ER-) cancers compared to estrogen receptor positive (ER+) including many glycolytic and glycogenolytic intermediates consistent with increased Warburg effects. Glutathione (GSH) pathway components were also elevated in ER- tumors consistent with an increased requirement for handling higher levels of oxidative stress. Additionally, ER- tumors had high levels of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and the immunomodulatory tryptophan metabolite kynurenine. Kynurenine levels were correlated with the expression of tryptophan-degrading enzyme (IDO1). However, high levels of 2-HG were not associated with somatic mutations or expression levels of IDH1 or IDH2. BRCA1 mRNA levels were positively associated with coenzyme A, acetyl coenzyme A, and GSH and negatively associated with multiple lipid species, supporting the regulation of ACC1 and NRF2 by BRCA1. Different driver mutations were associated with distinct patterns of specific metabolites, such as lower levels of several lipid-glycerophosphocholines in tumors with mutated TP53. A strong metabolomic signature associated with proliferation rate was also observed; the metabolites in this signature overlap broadly with metabolites that define ER status as receptor status and proliferation rate were correlated.

22822050,IDO1,10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-0014,IDO is a nodal pathogenic driver of lung cancer and metastasis development.,"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme inhibitors have entered clinical trials for cancer treatment based on preclinical studies, indicating that they can defeat immune escape and broadly enhance other therapeutic modalities. However, clear genetic evidence of the impact of IDO on tumorigenesis in physiologic models of primary or metastatic disease is lacking. Investigating the impact of Ido1 gene disruption in mouse models of oncogenic KRAS-induced lung carcinoma and breast carcinoma-derived pulmonary metastasis, we have found that IDO deficiency resulted in reduced lung tumor burden and improved survival in both models. Micro-computed tomographic (CT) imaging further revealed that the density of the underlying pulmonary blood vessels was significantly reduced in Ido1-nullizygous mice. During lung tumor and metastasis outgrowth, interleukin (IL)-6 induction was greatly attenuated in conjunction with the loss of IDO. Biologically, this resulted in a consequential impairment of protumorigenic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), as restoration of IL-6 recovered both MDSC suppressor function and metastasis susceptibility in Ido1-nullizygous mice. Together, our findings define IDO as a prototypical integrative modifier that bridges inflammation, vascularization, and immune escape to license primary and metastatic tumor outgrowth. This study provides preclinical, genetic proof-of-concept that the immunoregulatory enzyme IDO contributes to autochthonous carcinoma progression and to the creation of a metastatic niche. IDO deficiency in vivo negatively impacted both vascularization and IL-6&#x2013;dependent, MDSC-driven immune escape, establishing IDO as an overarching factor directing the establishment of a protumorigenic environment.",2013,"Adenocarcinoma; Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Animals; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Disease Progression; Genes, ras; HL-60 Cells; Humans; Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase; Inflammation; Interleukin-6; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lung Neoplasms; Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Survival Analysis; U937 Cells",17

The genetic basis of MGUS and its progression to MM remains poorly understood. C57BL/KaLwRij (KaLwRij) is a spontaneously-derived inbred mouse strain with a high frequency of benign idiopathic paraproteinemia (BIP), a phenotype with similarities to MGUS including progression to MM. Using mouse haplotype analysis, human MM SNP array data, and whole exome and whole genome sequencing of KaLwRij mice, we identified novel KaLwRij gene variants, including deletion of Samsn1 and deleterious point mutations in Tnfrsf22 and Tnfrsf23. These variants significantly affected multiple cell types implicated in MM pathogenesis including B-cells, macrophages, and bone marrow stromal cells. These data demonstrate that multiple cell types contribute to MM development prior to the acquisition of somatic driver mutations in KaLwRij mice, and suggest that MM may an inherently non-cell autonomous malignancy.",2016,"Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport; Animals; B-Lymphocytes; Bone Marrow Cells; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Macrophages; Mice; Multiple Myeloma; Neoplasm Proteins; Point Mutation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor; Stromal Cells",1

The acquisition and selection of genomic alterations may be critical to understanding the initiation and progression of this disease. In this study, we have systematically characterized the clonal architecture of 97 driver genes in 536 colorectal cancer patients from TCGA. A high proportion of clonal mutations in 93 driver genes were observed. 40 genes showed significant associations between their clonality and multiple clinicopathologic factors. Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that the mutation clonality of ANK1, CASP8, SMAD2, and ARID1A had a significant impact on the CRC patients' outcomes. Multivariable analysis revealed that subclonal ANK1 mutations, clonal CASP8 mutations, and clonal SMAD2 mutations independently predicted for shorter overall survival after adjusting for clinicopathological factors. The poor outcome of the subclonal ANK1 mutation may be caused by upregulation of IL4I1, IDO1, IFNG and MAPK12 which showed potential roles in tumor immune evasion through accumulation of immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells. These results suggested that the clonality of driver genes could act as prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets in human colorectal cancer.",2022,Clonal mutation; Colorectal cancer; Driver genes; Immune evasion; Prognostic biomarkers; Subclonal mutation; Colorectal Neoplasms; Genomics; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; L-Amino Acid Oxidase; Mutation,12

Here, we have demonstrated that the anti-CD137 agonist urelumab can overcome TGF&#x3b2;-mediated inhibition of human NK-cell proliferation and antitumor function. Transcriptomic, immunophenotypic, and functional analyses showed that CD137 costimulation modified the transcriptional program induced by TGF&#x3b2; on human NK cells by rescuing their proliferation in response to IL2, preserving their expression of activating receptors (NKG2D) and effector molecules (granzyme B, IFN&#x3b3;) while allowing the acquisition of tumor-homing/retention features (CXCR3, CD103). Activated NK cells cultured in the presence of TGF&#x3b2;1 and CD137 agonist recovered CCL5 and IFN&#x3b3; secretion and showed enhanced direct and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity upon restimulation with cancer cells. Trastuzumab treatment of fresh breast carcinoma-derived multicellular cultures induced CD137 expression on tumor-infiltrating CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, enabling the action of urelumab, which fostered tumor-infiltrating NK cells and recapitulated the enhancement of CCL5 and IFN&#x3b3; production. Bioinformatic analysis pointed to <i>IFNG</i> as the driver of the association between NK cells and clinical response to trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive primary breast cancer, highlighting the translational relevance of the CD137 costimulatory axis for enhancing IFN&#x3b3; production.

We sought to identify key cellular drivers of ICI-colitis and their similarities to idiopathic ulcerative colitis, and to determine potential novel therapeutic targets. We used a cross-sectional approach to study patients with ICI-colitis, those receiving ICI without the development of colitis, idiopathic ulcerative colitis, and healthy controls. A subset of patients with ICI-colitis were studied longitudinally. We applied a range of methods, including multiparameter and spectral flow cytometry, spectral immunofluorescence microscopy, targeted gene panels, and bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing.

The pattern of gastrointestinal immunopathology is distinct from ulcerative colitis at both the immune and epithelial-signaling levels. CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> cell activation correlates with clinical and endoscopic ICI-colitis severity. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis confirms activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> cells express high levels of transcripts for checkpoint inhibitors and interferon-gamma in ICI-colitis.

There is evidence that <i>MYCN</i> promotes a non-inflamed and T-cell infiltration-poor ('cold') tumor microenvironment (TME) by suppressing interferon signaling. This may explain, at least in part, why patients with NB seem to have little benefit from single-agent immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Targeting MYCN or its effectors could be a strategy to convert a cold TME into a 'hot' (inflamed) TME and improve the efficacy of ICB therapy. NB transcriptome analyses were used to identify epigenetic drivers of a T-cell infiltration-poor TME. Biological and molecular responses of NB cells to epigenetic drugs and interferon (IFN)-&#x3b3; exposure were assessed by proliferation assays, immunoblotting, ELISA, qRT-PCR, RNA-seq and ChIP-qPCR as well as co-culture assays with T cells. We identified H3K9 euchromatic histone-lysine methyltransferases EHMT2 and EHMT1, also known as G9a and GLP, as epigenetic effectors of the <i>MYCN</i>-driven malignant phenotype and repressors of IFN-&#x3b3; transcriptional responses in NB cells. EHMT inhibitors enhanced IFN-&#x3b3;-induced expression of the Th1-type chemokines <i>CXCL9</i> and <i>CXCL10</i>, key factors of T-cell recruitment into the TME. In <i>MYCN</i>-amplified NB cells, co-inhibition of EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homologue 2), a H3K27 histone methyltransferase cooperating with EHMTs, was needed for strong transcriptional responses to IFN-&#x3b3;, in line with histone mark changes at <i>CXCL9</i> and <i>CXCL10</i> chemokine gene loci. EHMT and EZH2 inhibitor response gene signatures from NB cells were established as surrogate measures and revealed high EHMT and EZH2 activity in <i>MYCN</i>-amplified high-risk NBs with a cold immune phenotype. Our results delineate a strategy for targeted epigenetic immunomodulation of high-risk NBs, whereby EHMT inhibitors alone or in combination with EZH2 inhibitors (in particular, <i>MYCN</i>-amplified NBs) could promote a T-cell-infiltrated TME via enhanced Th1-type chemokine expression.",2022,"immunomodulation; immunotherapy; inflammation; neuroblastoma; tumor microenvironment; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Line, Tumor; Chemokines; Coculture Techniques; Enzyme Inhibitors; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Amplification; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Histocompatibility Antigens; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Humans; Interferon-gamma; Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating; Molecular Targeted Therapy; N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein; Neuroblastoma; Signal Transduction; T-Lymphocytes; Transcriptome; Tumor Microenvironment",12

However, the ability of specific signals in the local tumor microenvironment to program macrophage metabolism remains under investigation. Here, we identify NAMPT, the rate limiting enzyme in NAD salvage synthesis, as a target of STAT1 during cellular activation by interferon gamma, an important driver of macrophage polarization and antitumor responses. We demonstrate that STAT1 occupies a conserved element within the first intron of Nampt, termed Nampt-Regulatory Element-1 (NRE1). Through disruption of NRE1 or pharmacological inhibition, a subset of M1 genes is sensitive to NAMPT activity through its impact on glycolytic processes. scRNAseq is used to profile in vivo responses by NRE1-deficient, tumor-associated leukocytes in melanoma tumors through the creation of a unique mouse strain. Reduced Nampt and inflammatory gene expression are present in specific myeloid and APC populations; moreover, targeted&#xa0;ablation of NRE1 in macrophage lineages results in greater tumor burden.

There is accumulating evidence that NK cells become dysfunctional during cancer. Overcoming NK cell exhaustion would be an important step to allow them to function optimally in a range of NK cell therapies, including those that depend on autologos circulating NK cells. We have previously demonstrated that NK cells undergo a normal metabolic reprogramming in response to cytokine activation and that this is required for optimal function. The objective of this work was to investigate if cellular metabolism of circulating NK cells is dysregulated in patients with metastatic breast cancer and if so, to gain insights into potential mechanisms underpinning this. Such discoveries would provide important insights into how to unleash the full activity of NK cells for maximum immunotherapy output. Single-cell analysis, metabolic flux and confocal analysis of NK cells from patients with metastatic breast cancer and healthy controls RESULTS: In addition to reduced interferon-&#x3b3; production and cytotoxicity, peripheral blood NK cells from patients had clear metabolic deficits including reduced glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. There were also distinct morphologically alterations in the mitochondria with increased mitochondrial fragmentation observed. Transforminggrowth factor-&#x3b2; (TGF&#x3b2;) was identified as a key driver of this phenotype as blocking its activity reversed many metabolic and functional readouts. Expression of glycoprotein-A repetitions predominant (GARP) and latency associated peptide (LAP), which are involved with a novel TGF&#x3b2; processing pathway, was increased on NK cells from some patients. Blocking the GARP-TGF&#x3b2; axis recapitulated the effects of TGF&#x3b2; neutralization, highlighting GARP as a novel NK cell immunotherapy target for the first time.

Familial HLH is associated with genetic cytotoxic impairment and thereby to excessive antigen presentation. Extreme elevation of serum interleukin-18 (IL-18) has been observed specifically in patients with MAS, making it a promising therapeutic target, but how IL-18 promotes hyperinflammation remains unknown. In an adjuvant-induced MAS model, excess IL-18 promoted immunopathology, whereas perforin deficiency had no effect. To determine the effects of excess IL-18 on virus-induced immunopathology, we infected Il18-transgenic (Il18tg) mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV; strain Armstrong). LCMV infection is self-limited in wild-type mice, but Prf1-/- mice develop prolonged viremia and fatal HLH. LCMV-infected Il18-transgenic (Il18tg) mice developed cachexia and hyperinflammation comparable to Prf1-/- mice, albeit with minimal mortality. Like Prf1-/- mice, immunopathology was largely rescued by CD8 depletion or interferon-&#x3b3; (IFNg) blockade. Unlike Prf1-/- mice, they showed normal target cell killing and normal clearance of viral RNA and antigens. Rather than impairing cytotoxicity, excess IL-18 acted on T lymphocytes to amplify their inflammatory responses. Surprisingly, combined perforin deficiency and transgenic IL-18 production caused spontaneous hyperinflammation specifically characterized by CD8 T-cell expansion and improved by IFNg blockade. Even Il18tg;Prf1-haplosufficient mice demonstrated hyperinflammatory features. Thus, excess IL-18 promotes hyperinflammation via an autoinflammatory mechanism distinct from, and synergistic with, cytotoxic impairment. These data establish IL-18 as a potent, independent, and modifiable driver of life-threatening innate and adaptive hyperinflammation and support the rationale for an IL-18-driven subclass of hyperinflammation.",2021,"Animals; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Female; Inflammation; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Interferon-gamma; Interleukin-18; Lymphocyte Activation; Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis; Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Transgenic; Perforin",12

In CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the transcription factor Oct1/Pou2f1 is a dispensable transcription factor for T cell development and response to primary infection, but promotes expression of target genes, including Il2 and Ifng, under conditions of antigen reencounter. As a result, they are more strongly expressed upon secondary stimulation. Such repeated antigen encounters occur in memory recall responses, in autoimmunity where self-antigen can be recognized multiple times, and in chronic infection where foreign antigen is persistent. Based on these previous findings, we hypothesized that Oct1 loss would protect animals from autoimmunity but maintain normal responses to pathogens in the CNS. We used a conditional mouse Oct1 (Pou2f1) allele and a CD4-Cre driver to determine the effect of T cell-specific Oct1 loss on autoimmune- and viral-induced neuroinflammation using an autoantigen-driven EAE model of autoimmunity and a JHMV model of viral infection. Oct1 conditional deletion mitigated clinical scores and reduced infiltrating T cells and cytokine production in the EAE model. Consistently, Oct1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells stimulated in vitro showed increased expression of markers associated with T cell anergy, particularly in the absence of co-stimulatory signals. In contrast, anti-viral T cell effector functions are intact in the absence of Oct1, with no changes in neuroinflammation, infiltrating T cells or cytokine production.

Here, we analyzed gene expression profiles (GEPs) using RNA from baseline tumor samples of pembrolizumab-treated patients. We identified immune-related signatures correlating with clinical benefit using a learn-and-confirm paradigm based on data from different clinical studies of pembrolizumab, starting with a small pilot of 19 melanoma patients and eventually defining a pan-tumor T cell-inflamed GEP in 220 patients with 9 cancers. Predictive value was independently confirmed and compared with that of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry in 96 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

21566463,IFNG,10.4161/cc.10.11.15674,Cytokine production and inflammation drive autophagy in the tumor microenvironment: role of stromal caveolin-1 as a key regulator.,"Recently, we proposed a new paradigm for understanding the role of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer onset and progression. In this model, cancer cells induce oxidative stress in adjacent fibroblasts. This, in turn, results in the onset of stromal autophagy, which produces recycled nutrients to ""feed"" anabolic cancer cells. However, it remains unknown how autophagy in the tumor microenvironment relates to inflammation, another key driver of tumorigenesis. To address this issue, here we employed a well-characterized co-culture system in which cancer cells induce autophagy in adjacent fibroblasts via oxidative stress and NF&#x3ba;B-activation. We show, using this co-culture system, that the same experimental conditions that result in an autophagic microenvironment, also drive in the production of numerous inflammatory mediators (including IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MIP1a, IFNg, RANTES (CCL5) and GMCSF). Furthermore, we demonstrate that most of these inflammatory mediators are individually sufficient to directly induce the onset of autophagy in fibroblasts. To further validate the in vivo relevance of these findings, we assessed the inflammatory status of Cav-1 (-/-) null mammary fat pads, which are a model of a bonafide autophagic microenvironment. Notably, we show that Cav-1 (-/-) mammary fat pads undergo infiltration with numerous inflammatory cell types, including lymphocytes, T-cells, macrophages and mast cells. Taken together, our results suggest that cytokine production and inflammation are key drivers of autophagy in the tumor microenvironment. These results may explain why a loss of stromal Cav-1 is a powerful predictor of poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients, as it is a marker of both (1) autophagy and (2) inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. Lastly, hypoxia in fibroblasts was not sufficient to induce the full-blown inflammatory response that we observed during the co-culture of fibroblasts with cancer cells, indicating that key reciprocal interactions between cancer cells and fibroblasts may be required.",2011,"Animals; Autophagy; Caveolin 1; Cell Communication; Cell Line, Tumor; Coculture Techniques; Cytokines; Fibroblasts; Hypoxia; Inflammation; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Neoplasms; Tumor Microenvironment",12

In this study we investigated how AXL regulated the disease progression and poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). We performed AXL transcriptome analysis from TCGA datasets, and found that AXL expression was significantly elevated in NSCLC and TNBC correlating with poor prognosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune-tolerant tumor microenvironment (TME). Knockdown of AXL or treatment with two independent AXL antibodies (named anti-AXL and AXL02) all diminished cell migration and EMT in AXL-high expressing NSCLC and TNBC cell lines. In a mouse model of 4T1 TNBC, administration of anti-AXL antibody substantially inhibited lung metastases formation and growth, accompanied by reduced downstream signaling activation, EMT and proliferation index, as well as an increased apoptosis and activated anti-tumor immunity. We found that AXL was abundantly activated in tumor nodule-infiltrated M2-macrophages. A specific anti-AXL antibody blocked bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) M2-polarization in vitro. Targeting of AXL in M2-macrophage in addition to tumor cell substantially suppressed CSF-1 production and eliminated M2-macrophage in TME, leading to a coordinated enhancement in both the innate and adaptive immunity reflecting M1-like macrophages, mature dendritic cells, cytotoxic T cells and B cells. We generated a novel and humanized AXL-ADC (AXL02-MMAE) employing a site-specific conjugation platform.

The continuous JAK-STAT pathway activation leads to enhanced activity of the promoter of CD274 coding programmed death-1 receptor ligand (PD-L1), increased PD-L1 level, and the immune escape of MPN cells.

The study group consisted of 162 ET pts, including 30 pts diagnosed with post-ET-MF. The JAK2V617F, CALR, and MPL mutations were found in 59.3%, 19.1%, and 1.2% of pts, respectively. No copy-number alternations of the JAK2, PDL1, and PDCDL1G2 (PDL2) genes were found. The level of PD-L1 was significantly higher in the JAK2V617F than in the JAK2WT, CALR mutation-positive, and triple-negative pts. The PD-L1 mRNA level was weakly correlated with both the JAK2V617F variant allele frequency (VAF), and with the JAK2V617F allele mRNA level. The total JAK2 level in post-ET-MF pts was lower than in ET pts, despite the lack of differences in the JAK2V617F VAF. In addition, the PD-L1 level was lower in post-ET-MF. A detailed analysis has shown that the decrease in JAK2 and PDL1 mRNA levels depended on the bone marrow fibrosis grade. The PDL1 expression showed no differences in relation to the genotype of the JAK2 haplotype<sup>GGCC_46/1</sup>, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit value, leukocyte, and platelet counts. The observed drop of the total JAK2 and PDL1 levels during the ET progression to the post-ET-MF may reflect the changes in the JAK2V617F positive clone proliferative potential and the PD-L1 level-related immunosuppressive effect. The above-mentioned hypothesis is supported by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, confirming a strong positive association between CD274 (encoding PD-L1), CXCR3 (encoding CXCR3), and CSF1 (encoding M-CSF) expression levels, and recently published results documenting a drop in the CXCR3 level and circulating M-CSF in patients with post-ET-MF.",2022,"Driver defects; Essential thrombocythaemia; JAK2V617F allele burden; JAK2V617F expression; Non-driver defects, Inflammation; PDL1 expression; Post-essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis; Total JAK2 expression; Humans; Thrombocythemia, Essential; Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; B7-H1 Antigen; Janus Kinases; STAT Transcription Factors; Signal Transduction; Janus Kinase 2; Myeloproliferative Disorders; Primary Myelofibrosis; Mutation; RNA, Messenger; Calreticulin",16

Mechanisms underlying ICI unresponsiveness versus sensitivity are not fully understood. To better delineate differential responses to ICI treatment, we employed mouse SCC models, termed KPPA tumors that were caused by deleting p53 and hyperactivating PIK3CA, two most frequently mutated genes in human HNSCCs. We transplanted two KPPA tumor lines (TAb2 versus TCh3) into C57BL/6 recipients and examined the immune tumor microenvironment using flow cytometry. Furthermore, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing to identify the difference in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). We found that different KPPA tumors exhibited heterogeneous immune profiles pre-existing treatment that dictated their sensitivity or unresponsiveness to anti-PD-L1. Unresponsive TAb2 tumors were highly enriched with functional tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), especially M2-TAMs. In contrast, sensitive TCh3 tumors contained more CD8 TILs with better effector functions. TAb2 tumor cells drastically expanded F4/80<sup>+</sup> TAMs from bone marrow precursors, requiring CSF1 and VEGF. Consistently, a higher combined expression of VEGF-C and CSF1 predicts worse survival in PIK3CA<sup>Amp</sup>/TP53<sup>Mutated</sup> HNSCC patients. Unresponsive TAb2 tumors upregulated distinct signaling pathways that correlate with aggressive tumor phenotypes. While anti-PD-L1 did not affect the TME of TAb2 tumors, it significantly increased the number of CD8 TILs in TCh3 tumors. We uncovered tumor-intrinsic differences that may underlie the differential responses to ICI by establishing and employing two SCC tumor lines, TAb2 vs. TCh3, both of which harbor TP53 deletion and PIK3CA hyperactivation. Our study indicates the limitation of stratifying cancers according to their genetic alterations and suggests that evaluating HNSCC tumor-intrinsic cues along with immune profiles in the TME may help better predict ICI responses. Our experimental models may provide a platform for pinpointing tumor-intrinsic differences underlying an immunosuppressive TME in HNSCCs and for testing combined immunotherapies targeting either tumor-specific or TAM-specific players to improve ICI efficacy.",2022,"Cancer immunotherapy; Head and neck cancers; Immune tumor microenvironment; PIK3CA hyperactivation; Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes; p53 mutations; Animals; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Oncogenes; Tumor Microenvironment",16

Traditionally, treatment modalities included partial or complete surgical synovectomy, radiotherapy (typically as an adjunct to surgery), and watchful monitoring (no medical or surgical intervention). However, these approaches have been met with varying degrees of success and high recurrence rates, as well as onerous complications and clinical sequelae. Pexidartinib, a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, presents a promising molecular approach that targets a neoplastic driver of TGCT. While the introduction of pexidartinib allows clinicians to avoid the significant morbidity associated with traditional treatment options, there are also defined risks associated with pexidartinib treatment. Therefore, patient selection is critical in optimizing treatment modalities in TGCT. The purpose of this literature review is to identify the TGCT patient population that would derive maximal benefit with minimal risk from pexidartinib, and to determine the specific indications and contraindications for selecting pexidartinib over other therapeutic approaches. Specifically, this paper compares the efficacy and safety profile of pexidartinib across clinical and preclinical studies to that of surgery, radiotherapy, and watchful monitoring. Rates of improvement in joint mobility, pain, and recurrence-free survival across studies of pexidartinib have been encouraging. The most common adverse events are mild (hypopigmentation of the hair) or reversible (transient aminotransferase elevation). Severe or permanent adverse events (notably cholestatic hepatotoxicity) are rare. While the optimal treatment strategy remains highly dependent on a patient's clinical circumstances and treatment goals, pexidartinib has surfaced as a promising therapeutic in cases where the morbidity of surgery or radiotherapy outweighs the benefits.",2022,CSF1; GCT-TS; PVNS; colony-stimulating factor 1; giant cell tumor of tendon sheath; hepatotoxicity; pigmented villonodular synovitis; radiotherapy; synovectomy,16

Here we show that intrinsic ageing of skeletal stem cells (SSCs)<sup>2</sup> in mice alters signalling in the bone marrow niche and skews the differentiation of bone and blood lineages, leading to fragile bones that regenerate poorly. Functionally, aged SSCs have a decreased bone- and cartilage-forming potential but produce more stromal lineages that express high levels of pro-inflammatory and pro-resorptive cytokines. Single-cell RNA-sequencing studies link the functional loss to a diminished transcriptomic diversity of SSCs in aged mice, which thereby contributes to the transformation of the bone marrow niche. Exposure to a youthful circulation through heterochronic parabiosis or systemic reconstitution with young haematopoietic stem cells did not reverse the diminished osteochondrogenic activity of aged SSCs, or improve bone mass or skeletal healing parameters in aged mice. Conversely, the aged SSC lineage promoted osteoclastic activity and myeloid skewing by haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that the ageing of SSCs is a driver of haematopoietic ageing. Deficient bone regeneration in aged mice could only be returned to youthful levels by applying a combinatorial treatment of BMP2 and a CSF1 antagonist locally to fractures, which reactivated aged SSCs and simultaneously ablated the inflammatory, pro-osteoclastic milieu. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the complex, multifactorial mechanisms that underlie skeletal ageing and offer prospects for rejuvenating the aged skeletal system.",2021,Aging; Animals; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; Bone Regeneration; Bone and Bones; Cell Lineage; Cellular Senescence; Female; Fracture Healing; Hematopoiesis; Inflammation; Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Male; Mice; Myeloid Cells; Osteoclasts; Rejuvenation; Stem Cell Niche; Stem Cells,16

Extending these studies within the tyrosine kinase (TK) family to identify disease drivers could improve our use of TK inhibitors to treat specific patient groups or individuals. We examined the expression distribution of TKs as a class (n = 89) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) muscle invasive BCa data set (n &gt;400). Patient profiles of potentially oncogenic alterations (overexpression and/or amplification) clustered TKs into 3 groups; alterations of group 1 and 3 TKs were associated with significantly worse patient survival relative to those without alterations. Many TK pathways induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which promotes tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Overexpression and/or amplification among 9 EMT transcriptional activators occurred in 43% of TCGA cases. Co-occurring alterations of TKs and EMT transcriptional activators involved most group 1 TKs; 24% of these events were associated with significantly worse patient survival. Co-occurring alterations of receptor TKs and their cognate ligands occurred in 16% of TCGA cases and several BCa-derived cell lines. Suppression of GAS6, MST1 or CSF1, or their respective receptors (AXL, MST1R and CSF1R), in BCa cell lines was associated with decreased receptor activation, cell migration, cell proliferation and anchorage independent cell growth. These studies reveal the patterns and prevalence of potentially oncogenic TK pathway-related alterations in BCa and identify specific alterations associated with reduced BCa patient survival.

We recently identified the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (Csf1r) gene as a novel driver of osteosarcomagenesis in mice using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon mutagenesis system. Here, we report that a CSF1R-CSF1 autocrine/paracrine signaling mechanism is constitutively activated in a subset of human OSA cases and is critical for promoting tumor growth and contributes to metastasis. We examined CSF1R and CSF1 expression in OSAs. We utilized gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies (GOF/LOF) to evaluate properties of cellular transformation, downstream signaling, and mechanisms of CSF1R-CSF1 action. Genetic perturbation of CSF1R in immortalized osteoblasts and human OSA cell lines significantly altered oncogenic properties, which were dependent on the CSF1R-CSF1 autocrine/paracrine signaling. These functional alterations were associated with changes in the known CSF1R downstream ERK effector pathway and mitotic cell cycle arrest. We evaluated the recently FDA-approved CSF1R inhibitor Pexidartinib (PLX3397) in OSA cell lines in vitro and in vivo in cell line and patient-derived xenografts. Pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R signaling recapitulated the in vitro genetic alterations. Moreover, in orthotopic OSA cell line and subcutaneous patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-injected mouse models, PLX3397 treatment significantly inhibited local OSA tumor growth and lessened metastatic burden.

Thus, simultaneously targeting tumor cells and stromal cells is expected to have synergistic antitumor effects. Herein, we present for the first time a preclinical antitumor investigation of 3D185, a novel dual inhibitor targeting FGFRs, which are oncogenic drivers, and CSF-1R, which is the major survival factor for protumor macrophages. The antitumor characteristics of 3D185 were assessed by a range of assays, including kinase profiling, cell viability, cell migration, immunoblotting, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell suppression, and in vivo antitumor efficacy, followed by flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analyses of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and endothelial cells in nude mice and immune-competent mice. 3D185 significantly inhibited the kinase activity of FGFR1/2/3 and CSF-1R, with equal potency and high selectivity over other kinases. 3D185 suppressed FGFR signaling and tumor cell growth in FGFR-driven models both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, 3D185 could inhibit the survival and M2-like polarization of macrophages, reversing the immunosuppressive effect of macrophages on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as well as CSF1-differentiated macrophage induced-FGFR3-aberrant cancer cell migration. Furthermore, 3D185 inhibited tumor growth via remodeling the tumor microenvironment in TAM-dominated tumor models. 3D185 is a promising antitumor candidate drug that simultaneously targets tumor cells and their immunosuppressive microenvironment and has therapeutic potential due to synergistic effects.

For the <i>in vivo</i> experiments C57BL/6, B6.129S7-Rag1<sup>tm1Mom</sup>/J, and B6.129P2(SJL)-Myd88<sup>tm1.1Defr</sup>/J mice were inoculated with ID8-fLuc. <i>In vivo</i> depletion experiments were performed using clodronate liposomes (CL), anti-CD8a, anti-GR1, anti-colony stimulating factor 1 (anti-CSF1), and TM&#x3b2;1 (anti-CD122).

The effect of MDSC on T cell proliferation and phenotype were studied <i>in vitro</i>. We discovered that the absence of T and B cells did not influence tumor growth or survival of B6.129S7-Rag1<sup>tm1Mom</sup>/J mice compared to immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice.

We investigated the feasibility of targeting these pathways as a therapeutic option in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse models. We analysed the number of tumour-infiltrating immune cells and the inflammatory immune profiles in chemically induced liver tumour isolated from wild-type and <i>OPN</i>knockout (KO) mice. In vitro cell cocultures were further conducted to investigate the crosstalk between TAMs and HCC cells mediated by OPN, colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) and CSF1 receptor (CSF1R). The in vivo efficacy of anti-PD-L1 and CSF1/CSF1R inhibition was evaluated in OPN overexpressing subcutaneous or orthotopic mouse model of HCC. The numbers of TAMs, as well as the expression levels of M2 macrophage markers and PD-L1 were significantly decreased, but the levels of cytokines produced by T-helper 1 (Th1) cells were upregulated in tumour tissues from OPN KO mice compared with that from the controls. In addition, we observed a positive association between the OPN and PD-L1 expression, and OPN expression and TAM infiltration in tumour tissues from patients with HCC. We further demonstrated that OPN facilitates chemotactic migration, and alternative activation of macrophages, and promotes the PD-L1 expression in HCC via activation of the CSF1-CSF1R pathway in macrophages. Combining anti-PD-L1 and CSF1R inhibition elicited potent antitumour activity and prolonged survival of OPN<sup>high</sup> tumour-bearing mice. Histological, flow cytometric and ELISA revealed increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration, reduced TAMs and enhanced Th1/Th2 cytokine balance in multiple mouse models of HCC.

One of the challenges of improving targeted therapies is to overcome bypassing signaling pathways. Analysis of RNA-seq data of 1006 cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) revealed that more than 12% of carcinoma cell lines expressed markedly elevated mRNA levels of colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1 receptor (CSF-1R). Since epithelial cells also express CSF-1, elevated levels of CSF-1R may participate in providing alternative growth and survival signals under targeted therapies. To address this question, we ectopically expressed CSF-1R in A431 cells that express EGFR at high levels, but no biologically relevant level of CSF-1R. In the presence of EGFR inhibitor gefitinib, CSF-1R provided a significant growth advantage in A431 cells. As expected, activation of both receptors, EGFR or CSF-1R, induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2, Akt, protein kinase C (PKC) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3. However, EGFR, but not CSF-1R, also induced STAT5 phosphorylation.

The mechanisms driving this vessel dysmorphia during tumor progression are poorly understood. Using longitudinal intravital imaging in a mouse glioma model, we identify that dynamic sprouting and functional morphogenesis of a highly branched vessel network characterize the initial tumor growth, dramatically changing to vessel expansion, leakage, and loss of branching complexity in the later stages. This vascular phenotype transition was accompanied by recruitment of predominantly pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages in the early stages, followed by <i>in&#xa0;situ</i> repolarization to M2-like macrophages, which produced VEGF-A and relocate to perivascular areas. A similar enrichment and perivascular accumulation of M2 versus M1 macrophages correlated with vessel dilation and malignancy in human glioma samples of different WHO malignancy grade. Targeting macrophages using anti-CSF1 treatment restored normal blood vessel patterning and function. Combination treatment with chemotherapy showed survival benefit, suggesting that targeting macrophages as the key driver of blood vessel dysmorphia in glioma progression presents opportunities to improve efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents.

We used an in vivo model that reproduces the IBC phenotype by co-injecting IBC cells with MSCs into the mammary fat pad. Mice were then treated with a macrophage recruitment inhibitor, anti-CSF1. MSC and macrophages grown in co-culture produced higher levels of pro-tumor properties such as enhanced migration and elevated IL-6 secretion. IBC cells co-cultured with educated MSCs also displayed enhanced invasion and mammosphere formation and blocked by anti-IL-6 and statin treatment. The treatment of mice co-injected with IBC cells and MSCs with anti-CSF1 inhibited tumor associated macrophages and inhibited pSTAT3 expression in tumor cells. Anti-CSF1 treated mice also exhibited reduced tumor growth, skin invasion, and local recurrence.

Critical drivers of immune escape in the tumor microenvironment include tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which not only mediate immune suppression, but also promote metastatic dissemination and impart resistance to cytotoxic therapies. Thus, strategies to ablate the effects of these myeloid cell populations may offer great therapeutic potential. In this report, we demonstrate in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that inhibiting signaling by the myeloid growth factor receptor CSF1R can functionally reprogram macrophage responses that enhance antigen presentation and productive antitumor T-cell responses. Investigations of this response revealed that CSF1R blockade also upregulated T-cell checkpoint molecules, including PDL1 and CTLA4, thereby restraining beneficial therapeutic effects. We found that PD1 and CTLA4 antagonists showed limited efficacy as single agents to restrain PDAC growth, but that combining these agents with CSF1R blockade potently elicited tumor regressions, even in larger established tumors.

Stress-induced neuroendocrine activation had a negligible effect on growth of the primary tumor but induced a 30-fold increase in metastasis to distant tissues including the lymph nodes and lung. These effects were mediated by &#x3b2;-adrenergic signaling, which increased the infiltration of CD11b(+)F4/80(+) macrophages into primary tumor parenchyma and thereby induced a prometastatic gene expression signature accompanied by indications of M2 macrophage differentiation. Pharmacologic activation of &#x3b2;-adrenergic signaling induced similar effects, and treatment of stressed animals with the &#x3b2;-antagonist propranolol reversed the stress-induced macrophage infiltration and inhibited tumor spread to distant tissues. The effects of stress on distant metastasis were also inhibited by in vivo macrophage suppression using the CSF-1 receptor kinase inhibitor GW2580. These findings identify activation of the sympathetic nervous system as a novel neural regulator of breast cancer metastasis and suggest new strategies for antimetastatic therapies that target the &#x3b2;-adrenergic induction of prometastatic gene expression in primary breast cancers.",2010,"Adenocarcinoma; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Macrophages; Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Neoplasm Metastasis; Stress, Physiological; Sympathetic Nervous System; T-Lymphocytes",16

Some of the most frequently activated oncogenes driving diverse cancers are c-MYC, EGFR, HER2, AKT, KRAS, BRAF, and MEK. Using a reductionist approach, we explored how cellular proteomes are remodeled in isogenic cell lines engineered with or without these driver oncogenes. The most striking discovery for all oncogenic models was the systematic downregulation of scores of antiviral proteins regulated by type 1 interferon. These findings extended to cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models of highly refractory pancreatic cancer and osteosarcoma driven by KRAS and MYC oncogenes. The oncogenes reduced basal expression of and autocrine stimulation by type 1 interferon causing remarkable convergence on common phenotypic and functional profiles. In particular, there was dramatically lower expression of dsRNA sensors including DDX58 (RIG-I) and OAS proteins, which resulted in attenuated functional responses when the oncogenic cells were treated with the dsRNA mimetic, polyI:C, and increased susceptibility to infection with an RNA virus shown using SARS-CoV-2.

Here, we characterize tumor biopsies from a patient with melanoma who displayed heterogeneous responses to anti-PD-1 therapy. We observe that a resistant tumor exhibited a loss-of-function mutation in the tumor suppressor gene <i>FBXW7</i>, whereas a sensitive tumor from the same patient did not. Consistent with a functional role in immunotherapy response, inactivation of <i>Fbxw7</i> in murine tumor cell lines caused resistance to anti-PD-1 in immunocompetent animals. Loss of <i>Fbxw7</i> was associated with altered immune microenvironment, decreased tumor-intrinsic expression of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensors MDA5 and RIG1, and diminished induction of type I IFN and MHC-I expression. In contrast, restoration of dsRNA sensing in <i>Fbxw7</i>-deficient cells was sufficient to sensitize them to anti-PD-1. Our results thus establish a new role for the commonly inactivated tumor suppressor <i>FBXW7</i> in viral sensing and sensitivity to immunotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings establish a role of the commonly inactivated tumor suppressor <i>FBXW7</i> as a genomic driver of response to anti-PD-1 therapy. <i>Fbxw7</i> loss promotes resistance to anti-PD-1 through the downregulation of viral sensing pathways, suggesting that therapeutic reactivation of these pathways could improve clinical responses to checkpoint inhibitors in genomically defined cancer patient populations.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1241</i>.",2021,"Aged; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Cell Line, Tumor; DEAD Box Protein 58; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HeLa Cells; Humans; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors; Interferon-Induced Helicase, IFIH1; Loss of Function Mutation; Male; Mice; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; RNA, Double-Stranded; Receptors, Immunologic; Skin Neoplasms; Tumor Microenvironment",3

Its malignant capacity is attributed to disruption of an EBV-host balance influenced by environmental and genetic drivers. EBV structures activate Type I interferon (IFN) pathway of the innate immunity, therefore, genetic polymorphisms could influence this response. We explored the impact of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on EBV-associated cHL susceptibility. Toll-like receptors 9 (TLR9_rs5743836), and 3 (TLR3_rs3775291), Interleukin-28B (IL28B_rs12979860), and DEAD-box polypeptide 58 (DDX58_rs10813831) were genotyped in 73 EBV-positive and 106 EBV-negative cHL patients and 396 controls. Only DDX58_rs10813831 T-allele was decreased among EBV-positive cHL compared to controls. A stratified analysis in EBV-positive cHL showed that the reduced rate was associated with younger age and nodular sclerosis. In conclusion, DDX58_rs10813831 T-allele may be associated with a reduced risk of nodular sclerosis EBV-related cHL, which suggests a role for RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I), encoded by DDX58, in these cases.",2018,"Classical Hodgkin lymphoma; DDX58; EBV; IFN pathway; IL28B; TLR-3; TLR-9; genetic susceptibility; single nucleotide polymorphisms; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alleles; Case-Control Studies; Cell Transformation, Viral; DEAD Box Protein 58; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Hodgkin Disease; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptors, Immunologic; Sclerosis; Young Adult",3

Recently, the next-generation sequencing approach has allowed systematic identification of molecular features in pediatric T-ALL. Here, by performing RNA-sequencing and other genomewide analysis, we investigated the genomic landscape in 61 adult and 69 pediatric T-ALL cases. Thirty-six distinct gene fusion transcripts were identified, with <i>SET-NUP214</i> being highly related to adult cases. Among 18 previously unknown fusions, <i>ZBTB16-ABL1</i>, <i>TRA-SALL2</i>, and involvement of <i>NKX2-1</i> were recurrent events. <i>ZBTB16-ABL1</i> functioned as a leukemogenic driver and responded to the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Among 48 genes with mutation rates &gt;3%, 6 were newly found in T-ALL. An aberrantly overexpressed short mRNA transcript of the <i>SLC17A9</i> gene was revealed in most cases with overexpressed <i>TAL1</i>, which predicted a poor prognosis in the adult group. Up-regulation of <i>HOXA</i>, <i>MEF2C</i>, and <i>LYL1</i> was often present in adult cases, while <i>TAL1</i> overexpression was detected mainly in the pediatric group. Although most gene fusions were mutually exclusive, they coexisted with gene mutations. These genetic abnormalities were correlated with deregulated gene expression markers in three subgroups.

In the majority of cases, this is associated with gain of a substantial part of chromosome 20q, indicating that multiple genes on the 20q amplicon may drive carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to identify genes located on the 20q amplicon that promote progression of colorectal adenoma to carcinoma. Functional assays were performed for 32 candidate driver genes for which a positive correlation between 20q DNA copy number and mRNA expression had been demonstrated. Effects of gene knockdown on cell viability, anchorage-independent growth, and invasion were analysed in colorectal cancer cell lines with 20q gain. Colorectal tumour protein expression was examined by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays. TPX2, AURKA, CSE1L, DIDO1, HM13, TCFL5, SLC17A9, RBM39 and PRPF6 affected cell viability and/or anchorage-independent growth. Chromosome 20q DNA copy number status correlated significantly with TPX2 and AURKA protein levels in a series of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas. Moreover, downmodulation of TPX2 and AURKA was shown to inhibit invasion. These data identify TPX2 (20q11) and AURKA (20q13.2) as two genes located on distinct regions of chromosome 20q that promote 20q amplicon-driven progression of colorectal adenoma to carcinoma. Therefore the selection advantage imposed by 20q gain in tumour progression is achieved by gain-of-function of multiple cancer-related genes-knowledge that can be translated into novel tests for early diagnosis of progressive adenomas.",2012,"Adenocarcinoma; Adenoma; Aurora Kinase A; Aurora Kinases; Biopsy, Needle; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20; Colorectal Neoplasms; DNA Copy Number Variations; Disease Progression; Female; Gene Amplification; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Nuclear Proteins; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; RNA, Neoplasm; Sampling Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tumor Cells, Cultured",2

Hence, the question arises whether implementation of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) using Fresh Frozen (FrFr) tumor tissue in addition to gene panel and DNA methylation analysis improves diagnostic accuracy and provides additional clinical benefit. Analysis of patients age 0 to 21 years, enrolled in Germany between 04/2019 and 02/2021, and for whom FrFr tissue was available. Central reference histopathology, immunohistochemistry, 850k DNA methylation analysis, gene panel sequencing and RNA-Seq were performed. FrFr tissue was available in 178/379 enrolled cases. RNA-Seq was performed on 125 of these samples. We confirmed KIAA1549::BRAF-fusion (n=71), BRAF V600E-mutation (n=12) and alterations in FGFR1 (n=14) as the most frequent alterations, among other common molecular drivers (n=12). . N=16 cases (13%) presented rare gene fusions (e.g. TPM3::NTRK1, EWSR1::VGLL1, SH3PXD2A::HTRA1, PDGFB::LRP1, GOPC::ROS1). In n=27 cases (22%), RNA-Seq detected a driver alteration not otherwise identified (22/27 actionable). The rate of driver alteration detection was hereby increased from 75% to 97%. Furthermore, FGFR1 ITD (n=6) were only detected by RNA-Seq using current bioinformatics pipelines, leading to a change in analysis protocols. The addition of RNA-Seq to current diagnostic methods improves diagnostic accuracy, making precision oncology treatments (MEKi/RAFi/ERKi/NTRKi/FGFRi/ROSi) more accessible.

Incomplete understanding of myeloid cells response to tumor driver mutation and therapeutic intervention impedes effective therapeutic design. Here, by leveraging CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing, we generate a mouse model that is deficient of all monocyte chemoattractant proteins. Using this strain, we effectively abolish monocyte infiltration in genetically engineered murine models of de novo glioblastoma (GBM) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which show differential enrichment patterns for monocytes and neutrophils. Eliminating monocyte chemoattraction in monocyte enriched PDGFB-driven GBM invokes a compensatory neutrophil influx, while having no effect on Nf1-silenced GBM model. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that intratumoral neutrophils promote proneural-to-mesenchymal transition and increase hypoxia in PDGFB-driven GBM. We further demonstrate neutrophil-derived TNF-a directly drives mesenchymal transition in PDGFB-driven primary GBM cells. Genetic or pharmacological inhibiting neutrophils in HCC or monocyte-deficient PDGFB-driven and Nf1-silenced GBM models extend the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Our findings demonstrate tumor-type and genotype dependent infiltration and function of monocytes and neutrophils and highlight the importance of targeting them simultaneously for cancer treatments.",2023,"Mice; Animals; Glioblastoma; Monocytes; Neutrophils; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis; Cell Line, Tumor; Brain Neoplasms; Liver Neoplasms",18

This simplified collective of tumors most commonly arise from subcutaneous tissues, are treated similar clinically, and conventionally exclude other sarcomas with more definitive anatomical, histological, or biological features. Histologically, canine STS sub-types are difficult to discern at the light microscopic level due to their overlapping features. Thus, genomic, and transcriptomic profiling of canine STS may prove valuable in differentiating the diverse sub-types of mesenchymal neoplasms within this group. To this purpose we sought to characterize the transcript expression and genomic mutation profiles of canine STS. To delineate transcriptomic sub-types, hierarchical clustering was used to identify 4 groups with district expression profiles. Using the RNAseq data, we identified three samples carrying driver fusions of platelet derived growth factor B ( <i>PDGFB</i> ) and collagen genes. Sensitivity to imatinib was evaluated in a canine STS cell line also bearing a <i>PDGFB</i> fusion. Using whole exome sequencing, recurrent driver variants were identified in the cancer genes <i>KMT2D</i> (21% of the samples) and <i>TP53</i> (21%) along with copy number losses of RB1 and CDKN2A. Gene amplifications and resulting transcript increases were identified in genes on chromosomes 13, 14, and 36. A subset of STS was identified with high T-cell infiltration. This multi-omics approach has defined canine STS sub-types at a molecular level for comparison to their human counterparts, to improve diagnosis, and may provide additional targets for therapy.",2023,NA,18

MET amplification has been indicated as a driver of acquired resistance. Clinical activity has been demonstrated for the combination of EGFR and MET inhibitors in mCRC. But the impact of this regimen on angiogenesis and inflammation remains largely unknown. In this non-randomized, open-label phase Ib/II study, four patients were treated with cabozantinib alone and 25 patients received the combination of cabozantinib and panitumumab. MET amplification was detected in blood in all four patients treated with cabozantinib monotherapy and 5/25 patients treated with cabozantinib and panitumumab combination therapy. Plasma samples from 28 patients were available for biomarker analysis. A panel of circulating protein biomarkers was assessed in patient plasma at baseline and on-treatment. Baseline marker levels were analyzed for prognostic value for clinical outcomes, including MET amplification as a covariate. HGF and OPN were prognostic for both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), while six markers (IL-6, VCAM-1, VEGF-R1, TSP-2, TIMP-1, ICAM-1) were prognostic only for OS. In patients with MET amplification, baseline PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, TGF-&#x3b2;1, and VEGF-C levels were significantly higher, whereas baseline TGF&#x3b2;-R3 levels were significantly lower than MET non-amplified patients. On-treatment change of four markers (CD73, PlGF, PDGF-BB, VEGF) were significantly different between MET amplified and non-amplified subpopulations. This study identified circulating HGF and several inflammatory and angiogenic proteins as prognostic biomarkers.

However, TAM depletion by CSF1R inhibition showed mixed results in clinical trials. We hypothesized that GBM subtype-specific tumor microenvironment (TME) conveys distinct sensitivities to TAM targeting. We generated syngeneic PDGFB- and RAS-driven GBM models that resemble proneural-like and mesenchymal-like gliomas, and determined the effect of TAM targeting by CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397 on glioma growth. We also investigated the co-targeting of TAMs and angiogenesis on PLX3397-resistant RAS-driven GBM. Using single-cell transcriptomic profiling, we further explored differences in TME cellular compositions and functions in PDGFB- and RAS-driven gliomas. We found that growth of PDGFB-driven tumors was markedly inhibited by PLX3397. In contrast, depletion of TAMs at the early phase accelerated RAS-driven tumor growth and had no effects on other proneural and mesenchymal GBM models. In addition, PLX3397-resistant RAS-driven tumors did not respond to PI3K signaling inhibition. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling revealed that PDGFB-driven gliomas induced expansion and activation of pro-tumor microglia, whereas TAMs in mesenchymal RAS-driven GBM were enriched in pro-inflammatory and angiogenic signaling. Co-targeting of TAMs and angiogenesis decreased cell proliferation and changed the morphology of RAS-driven gliomas. Our work identifies functionally distinct TAM subpopulations in the growth of different glioma subtypes. Notably, we uncover a potential responsiveness of resistant mesenchymal-like gliomas to combined anti-angiogenic therapy and CSF1R inhibition.

Initial molecular characterization identified NTRK1 and NTRK3 gene fusions as oncogenic drivers in these tumors; however, the repertoire of genetic alterations is likely more diverse given the recent discovery of PDGFB and RET gene fusions in similarly described tumors. Importantly, these fusion events lead to the aberrant activation of kinases that are potentially therapeutically targetable; therefore, recognizing this class of tumor becomes critical for initiating the molecular testing required for an accurate diagnosis and identification of clinically actionable fusions. Here, we report our institutional experience with 12 cases of uterine spindle cell sarcomas harboring kinase-related fusions. Patients ranged from 21 to 80 years old (median, 38&#x2009;y) and presented either asymptomatically or with pelvic pain and/or uterine bleeding. Eleven (92%; 11/12) tumors were localized to the cervix and 1 (8%; 1/12) tumor was localized in the anterior fundus of the uterine corpus. Tumors ranged in size from 1.5 to 15.0&#x2009;cm (median, 6.0&#x2009;cm) and were histologically characterized by a moderately cellular, infiltrative proliferation of spindle cells with features of benign gland entrapment, stromal collagen deposition, perivascular hyalinization, occasionally myxoid stroma, a lymphocytic infiltrate, occasional nuclear pseudoinclusions, and a pseudophyllodes architecture. RNA-sequencing identified NTRK1 (8/12), NTRK3 (1/12), and PDGFB (2/12) gene fusions, which have been previously implicated in this tumor class, as well as a novel FGFR1-TACC1 (1/12) fusion. All tumors in this cohort showed coexpression of CD34 and S100 by immunohistochemistry except for those tumors with PDGFB fusions which showed solely CD34 expression. Of the 10 surgically resected tumors with follow-up, outcomes best correlated with the stage of disease. One of 4 patients with stage IA tumors (1/4) had recurrences, half of the stage IB (2/4) tumors had recurrences and all of the stage IIB tumors (2/2) had recurrences and died of disease.

33300045,PDGFB,10.1093/brain/awaa382,Platelet-derived growth factor beta is a potent inflammatory driver in paediatric high-grade glioma.,"Paediatric high-grade gliomas (HGGs) account for the most brain tumour-related deaths in children and have a median survival of 12-15 months. One promising avenue of research is the development of novel therapies targeting the properties of non-neoplastic cell-types within the tumour such as tumour associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs are immunosuppressive and promote tumour malignancy in adult HGG; however, in paediatric medulloblastoma, TAMs exhibit anti-tumour properties. Much is known about TAMs in adult HGG, yet little is known about them in the paediatric setting. This raises the question of whether paediatric HGGs possess a distinct constituency of TAMs because of their unique genetic landscapes. Using human paediatric HGG tissue samples and murine models of paediatric HGG, we demonstrate diffuse midline gliomas possess a greater inflammatory gene expression profile compared to hemispheric paediatric HGGs. We also show despite possessing sparse T-cell infiltration, human paediatric HGGs possess high infiltration of IBA1+ TAMs. CD31, PDGFR&#x3b2;, and PDGFB all strongly correlate with IBA1+ TAM infiltration. To investigate the TAM population, we used the RCAS/tv-a system to recapitulate paediatric HGG in newborn immunocompetent mice. Tumours are induced in Nestin-positive brain cells by PDGFA or PDGFB overexpression with Cdkn2a or Tp53 co-mutations. Tumours driven by PDGFB have a significantly lower median survival compared to PDGFA-driven tumours and have increased TAM infiltration. NanoString and quantitative PCR analysis indicates PDGFB-driven tumours have a highly inflammatory microenvironment characterized by high chemokine expression. In vitro bone marrow-derived monocyte and microglial cultures demonstrate bone marrow-derived monocytes are most responsible for the production of inflammatory signals in the tumour microenvironment in response to PDGFB stimulation. Lastly, using knockout mice deficient for individual chemokines, we demonstrate the feasibility of reducing TAM infiltration and prolonging survival in both PDGFA and PDGFB-driven tumours. We identify CCL3 as a potential key chemokine in these processes in both humans and mice. Together, these studies provide evidence for the potent inflammatory effects PDGFB has in paediatric HGGs.",2021,"PDGFB; TAM; diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma; inflammation; macrophage; paediatric glioma; Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Brain Neoplasms; Cells, Cultured; Chemokines; Child; Child, Preschool; Encephalitis; Female; Glioma; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis; Transcriptome; Tumor-Associated Macrophages; Young Adult",18

Recently, we identified GATA4 as the master regulator of LSEC specification during development. Herein, we studied the role of endothelial GATA4 in the adult liver and in hepatic pathogenesis. We generated adult Clec4g-icre<sup>tg/0</sup>xGata4<sup>fl/fl</sup> (Gata4<sup>LSEC-KO</sup>) mice with LSEC-specific depletion of Gata4. Livers were analyzed by histology, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, and LSECs were isolated for gene expression profiling, ChIP- and ATAC-sequencing. Partial hepatectomy was performed to assess regeneration. We used choline-deficient, l-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet and chronic carbon tetrachloride exposure to model liver fibrosis. Human single cell RNA-seq data sets were analyzed for endothelial alterations in healthy and cirrhotic livers. Genetic Gata4 deficiency in LSECs of adult mice caused perisinusoidal liver fibrosis, hepatopathy and impaired liver regeneration. Sinusoidal capillarization and LSEC-to-continuous endothelial transdifferentiation were accompanied by a profibrotic angiocrine switch involving de novo endothelial expression of hepatic stellate cell-activating cytokine PDGFB. Increased chromatin accessibility and amplification by activated MYC mediated angiocrine Pdgfb expression. As observed in Gata4<sup>LSEC-KO</sup> livers, CDAA diet-induced perisinusoidal liver fibrosis was associated with GATA4 repression, MYC activation and a profibrotic angiocrine switch in LSECs. Comparison of CDAA-fed Gata4<sup>LSEC-KO</sup> and control mice demonstrated that endothelial GATA4 indeed protects against dietary-induced perisinusoidal liver fibrosis. In human cirrhotic livers, GATA4-positive LSECs and endothelial GATA4 target genes were reduced, while non-LSEC endothelial cells and MYC target genes including PDGFB were enriched. Endothelial GATA4 protects against perisinusoidal liver fibrosis by repressing MYC activation and profibrotic angiocrine signaling at the chromatin level. Therapies targeting the GATA4/MYC/PDGFB/PDGFR&#x3b2; axis offer a promising strategy for prevention and treatment of liver fibrosis. The liver vasculature is supposed to play a major role in the development of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, which can lead to liver failure and liver cancer. Herein, we discovered that structural and transcriptional changes induced by genetic deletion of the transcription factor GATA4 in the hepatic endothelium were sufficient to cause liver fibrosis. Activation of the transcription factor MYC and de novo expression of the ""angiocrine"" growth factor PDGFB were identified as downstream drivers of fibrosis and as potential therapeutic targets for this potentially fatal disease.",2022,ATAC-Seq; Angiocrine signaling; CDAA; Chromatin; Cytokines; Endothelial cells; Hepatic stellate cells; Humans; Liver fibrosis; Liver regeneration; Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells; Mice; Animals; Chromatin; Drug Discovery; Endothelial Cells; GATA4 Transcription Factor; Gene Expression Profiling; Hepatic Stellate Cells; Humans; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Regeneration; Lymphokines; Mice; Platelet-Derived Growth Factor; Signal Transduction; Zinc Fingers,18

In addition to being genetically heterogeneous, GBMs are also immunologically heterogeneous. However, whether the differences in immune microenvironment are driven by genetic driver mutation is unexplored.

Along with our previously published Nf1-silenced and PDGFB-overexpressing models, we investigate the immune microenvironments of the three models of human GBM subtypes by unbiased multiplex profiling. We demonstrate that both the quantity and composition of the microenvironmental myeloid cells are dictated by the genetic driver mutations, closely mimicking what was observed in human GBM subtypes. These myeloid cells express high levels of the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1; however, PD-L1 targeted therapies alone or in combination with irradiation are unable to increase the survival time of tumor-bearing mice regardless of the driver mutations, reflecting the outcomes of recent human trials. Together, these results highlight the critical utility of immunocompetent mouse models for preclinical studies of GBM, making these models indispensable tools for understanding the resistance mechanisms of immune checkpoint blockade in GBM and immune cell-targeting drug discovery.",2021,"EGFRvIII; GEMM of GBM; PD-L1; glioblastoma; microenvironment; Animals; Brain Neoplasms; Female; Glioblastoma; Humans; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Mutation; Tumor Cells, Cultured",18

In the present study, we report the production of a high-grade spinal cord glioma model in pigs using lentiviral gene transfer. Six Gottingen Minipigs received thoracolumbar (T14-L1) lateral white matter injections of a combination of lentiviral vectors, expressing platelet-derived growth factor beta (PDGF-B), constitutive HRAS, and shRNA-p53 respectively. All animals received injection of control vectors into the contralateral cord. Animals underwent baseline and endpoint magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were evaluated daily for clinical deficits. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and immunohistochemical analysis was conducted. Data are presented using descriptive statistics including relative frequencies, mean, standard deviation, and range. 100% of animals (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;6/6) developed clinical motor deficits ipsilateral to the oncogenic lentiviral injections by a three-week endpoint. MRI scans at endpoint demonstrated contrast enhancing mass lesions at the site of oncogenic lentiviral injection and not at the site of control injections. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated positive staining for GFAP, Olig2, and a high Ki-67 proliferative index. Histopathologic features demonstrate consistent and reproducible growth of a high-grade glioma in all animals.

The present model is the first lentiviral vector induced pig model of high-grade spinal cord glioma and may potentially be used in preclinical therapeutic development programs.",2020,"Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Genetic Vectors; Glioma; Humans; Lentivirus; Male; Motor Disorders; Neoplasm Grading; Spinal Cord Neoplasms; Swine; Swine, Miniature",18
31054489,PDGFB,10.1016/j.drup.2019.04.002,The TICking clock of EGFR therapy resistance in glioblastoma: Target Independence or target Compensation.,"Targeted therapy against driver mutations responsible for cancer progression has been shown to be effective in many tumor types. For glioblastoma (GBM), the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene is the most frequently mutated oncogenic driver and has therefore been considered an attractive target for therapy. However, so far responses to EGFR-pathway inhibitors have been disappointing. We performed an exhaustive analysis of the mechanisms that might account for therapy resistance against EGFR inhibition. We define two major mechanisms of resistance and propose modalities to overcome them. The first resistance mechanism concerns target independence. In this case, cells have lost expression of the EGFR protein and experience no negative impact of EGFR targeting. Loss of extrachromosomally encoded EGFR as present in double minute DNA is a frequent mechanism for this type of drug resistance. The second mechanism concerns target compensation. In this case, cells will counteract EGFR inhibition by activation of compensatory pathways that render them independent of EGFR signaling. Compensatory pathway candidates are platelet-derived growth factor &#x3b2; (PDGF&#x3b2;), Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGFR1) and cMET and their downstream targets, all not commonly mutated at the time of diagnosis alongside EGFR mutation. Given that both mechanisms make cells independent of EGFR expression, other means have to be found to eradicate drug resistant cells. To this end we suggest rational strategies which include the use of multi-target therapies that hit truncation mutations (mechanism 1) or multi-target therapies to co-inhibit compensatory proteins (mechanism 2).",2020,"CMET; EGFR inhibition; Glioblastoma; IGFR1; Target compensation, PDGFR; Target independence; Therapy resistance; Brain Neoplasms; Carcinogenesis; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; ErbB Receptors; Glioblastoma; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Mutation; Oncogenes; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis; Receptor, IGF Type 1; Signal Transduction; Treatment Outcome",18

The high pro-angiogenic nature of the TME perpetuates the chaotic network of structurally immature, low pericyte-covered vessels characteristic of the tumor vasculature. We previously demonstrated that chloroquine (CQ) -a lysosomotropic agent used as first-generation autophagy blocker in clinical trials- induced tumor vessel normalization and reduced tumor hypoxia. CQ improved both vessel structure and maturation, whereas the conditional knockout of the crucial autophagy gene <i>Atg5</i> in endothelial cells (ECs) did not, thus highlighting a potential differential role for EC-associated autophagy and the lysosomes in pathological tumor angiogenesis. However, how CQ or ATG5-deficiency in ECs affect angiogenic signals regulating EC-pericyte interface and therefore vessel maturation, remains unknown. Here, we show that in ECs CQ constrained VEGF-A-mediated VEGF receptor (VEGFR)2 phosphorylation, a driver of angiogenic signaling. In the presence of CQ we observed increased expression of the decoy receptor VEGFR1 and of a lower molecular weight form of VEGFR2, suggesting receptor cleavage. Consequently, VEGF-A-driven EC spheroid sprouting was reduced by CQ treatment. Furthermore, CQ significantly affected the transcription and secretion of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AB/BB (upregulated) and Endothelin-1 (EDN1, downregulated), both modulators of perivascular cell (PC) behavior. In contrast, silencing of ATG5 in ECs had no effect on <i>VEGFR2</i> to <i>VEGFR1</i> ratio nor on <i>PDGFB</i> and <i>EDN1</i> expression. Accordingly, mice harboring B16F10 melanoma tumors treated with CQ, displayed both an increased number of &#x3b1;SMA<sup>+</sup> PCs covering tumor vessels and co-expressed PDGF receptor-&#x3b2;, enabling PDGF ligand dependent recruitment. Moreover, upon CQ treatment the tumoral expression of angiopoietin-1 (<i>Angpt1)</i>, which retains mural cells, and induces vessel stabilization by binding to the EC-localized cognate receptor (TIE2), was increased thus supporting the vessel normalization function of CQ. These features associated with improved tumor vasculature were not phenocopied by the specific deletion of <i>Atg5</i> in ECs. In conclusion, this study further unravels endothelial cell autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms by which CQ ""normalizes"" the intercellular communication in the tumor vasculature independent of autophagy.",2022,Angiopoietin1; Autophagy; PDGFR-&#x3b2;; VEGF/VEGFR-axis; intercellular crosstalk; tumor endothelial cells,18

The mechanisms driving this vessel dysmorphia during tumor progression are poorly understood. Using longitudinal intravital imaging in a mouse glioma model, we identify that dynamic sprouting and functional morphogenesis of a highly branched vessel network characterize the initial tumor growth, dramatically changing to vessel expansion, leakage, and loss of branching complexity in the later stages. This vascular phenotype transition was accompanied by recruitment of predominantly pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages in the early stages, followed by <i>in&#xa0;situ</i> repolarization to M2-like macrophages, which produced VEGF-A and relocate to perivascular areas. A similar enrichment and perivascular accumulation of M2 versus M1 macrophages correlated with vessel dilation and malignancy in human glioma samples of different WHO malignancy grade. Targeting macrophages using anti-CSF1 treatment restored normal blood vessel patterning and function. Combination treatment with chemotherapy showed survival benefit, suggesting that targeting macrophages as the key driver of blood vessel dysmorphia in glioma progression presents opportunities to improve efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. We propose that vessel dysfunction is not simply a general feature of tumor vessel formation, but rather an emergent property resulting from a dynamic and functional reorganization of the tumor stroma and its angiogenic influences.",2018,"VEGF; glioma; live imaging; myeloid cells; vessel dysmorphia; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating; Blood Vessels; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Dacarbazine; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Glioma; Humans; Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Macrophages; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Phenotype; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis; Temozolomide; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",18

28836293,PDGFB,10.1002/glia.23203,Genetic driver mutations define the expression signature and microenvironmental composition of high-grade gliomas.,"High-grade gliomas (HGG), including glioblastomas, are characterized by invasive growth, resistance to therapy, and high inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. The key histological hallmarks of glioblastoma are pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation, which allow pathologists to distinguish glioblastoma from lower-grade gliomas. In addition to being genetically and molecularly heterogeneous, HGG are also heterogeneous with respect to the composition of their microenvironment. The question of whether this microenvironmental heterogeneity is driven by the molecular identity of the tumor remains controversial. However, this question is of utmost importance since microenvironmental, non-neoplastic cells are key components of the most radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-resistant niches of the tumor. Our work demonstrates a versatile, reliable, and reproducible adult HGG mouse model with NF1-silencing as a driver mutation. This model shows significant differences in tumor microenvironment, expression of subtype-specific markers, and response to standard therapy when compared to our established PDGFB-overexpressing HGG mouse model. PDGFB-overexpressing and NF1-silenced murine tumors closely cluster with human proneural and mesenchymal subtypes, as well as PDGFRA-amplified and NF1-deleted/mutant human tumors, respectively, at both the RNA and protein expression levels.

These gene fusions constitute pivotal driver mutations, and detailed studies of their cellular effects have provided important knowledge about pathogenetic mechanisms in STT. Furthermore, most fusions are strongly associated with a particular histotype, serving as ideal molecular diagnostic markers. In recent years, it has also become apparent that some chimeric proteins, directly or indirectly, constitute excellent treatment targets, making the detection of gene fusions in STT ever more important. Indeed, pharmacological treatment of STT displaying fusions that activate protein kinases, such as ALK and ROS1, or growth factors, such as PDGFB, is already in clinical use. However, the vast majority (52/78) of recurrent gene fusions create structurally altered and/or deregulated transcription factors, and a small but growing subset develops through rearranged chromatin regulators.

We then developed a computational methodology to identify drivers of broad copy number changes, identifying PDGFA (chr7) and PTEN (chr10) as driving initial nondisjunction events. These predictions were validated using mouse modeling, showing that PDGFA is sufficient to induce proneural-like gliomas and that additional NF1 loss converts proneural to the mesenchymal subtype.

The objectives of this study were to utilize integrated genomic data including copy-number alteration, mRNA, microRNA expression and candidate-gene full sequencing data to characterize the molecular distinctions between AC and SCC. Comparative genomic hybridization followed by mutational analysis, gene expression and miRNA microarray profiling were performed on 123 paired tumor and non-tumor tissue samples from patients with NSCLC. At DNA, mRNA and miRNA levels we could identify molecular markers that discriminated significantly between the various histopathological entities of NSCLC. We identified 34 genomic clusters using aCGH data; several genes exhibited a different profile of aberrations between AC and SCC, including PIK3CA, SOX2, THPO, TP63, PDGFB genes. Gene expression profiling analysis identified SPP1, CTHRC1 and GREM1 as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of the cancer, and SPINK1 and BMP7 to distinguish between AC and SCC in small biopsies or in blood samples. Using integrated genomics approach we found in recurrently altered regions a list of three potential driver genes, MRPS22, NDRG1 and RNF7, which were consistently over-expressed in amplified regions, had wide-spread correlation with an average of ~800 genes throughout the genome and highly associated with histological types. Using a network enrichment analysis, the targets of these potential drivers were seen to be involved in DNA replication, cell cycle, mismatch repair, p53 signalling pathway and other lung cancer related signalling pathways, and many immunological pathways. Furthermore, we also identified one potential driver miRNA hsa-miR-944. Integrated molecular characterization of AC and SCC helped identify clinically relevant markers and potential drivers, which are recurrent and stable changes at DNA level that have functional implications at RNA level and have strong association with histological subtypes.",2014,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; DNA Copy Number Variations; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; RNA, Messenger",18

The prognostic relevance of PCD-related genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, there is still a lack of efforts to compare the methylation status of different types of PCD genes in HCC and their roles in its surveillance. The methylation status of genes related to pyroptosis, apoptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis was analyzed in tumor and non-tumor tissues from TCGA. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data of paired tumor tissue and buffy coat samples were used to filter the potential interference of blood leukocytes in cell-free DNA (cfDNA). The WGBS data of healthy individuals' and early-stage HCC patients' cfDNA were analyzed to evaluate the distinguishing ability. The average gene body methylation (gbDNAme) of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) was significantly altered in HCC tissues relative to normal tissues, and their distinguishing ability was higher compared to the other types of PCD-related genes. The gbDNAme of NLRP7, NLRP2, and NLRP3 was reflective of the hypomethylation in HCC tissues, and methylation levels of NLRP3 correlated positively with its expression level (r=0.51). The candidate hypomethylated PRGs could discriminate between early HCC patients and healthy controls in cfDNA analysis with high accuracy (area under the receiver operation curve, AUC=0.94). Furthermore, the hypomethylation of PRGs was associated with poor prognosis of HCC.

Dysregulated immune and inflammasome activation is thought to be the central driver of unresolving inflammation, which in some ways provides a unified theory of disease pathology and progression. Inflammasomes are a group of large cytosolic protein complexes that, in response to infection- or stress-associated stimuli, oligomerize and assemble to generate a platform for driving inflammation. This occurs through proteolytic activation of caspase-1-mediated inflammatory responses, including cleavage and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1&#x3b2; and IL-18, and initiation of pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death. Several inflammasomes have been characterized. The most well-studied is the nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, so named because the NLRP3 protein in the complex, which is primarily present in immune and inflammatory cells following activation by inflammatory stimuli, belongs to the family of nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (Nod) receptor proteins. Several NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors are in development, all with multi-indication activity. This review discusses the current status, known mechanisms of action, and disease-modifying therapeutic potential of RRx-001, a direct NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor under investigation in several late-stage anticancer clinical trials, including a phase 3 trial for the treatment of third-line and beyond small cell lung cancer (SCLC), an indication with no treatment, in which RRx-001 is combined with reintroduced chemotherapy from the first line, carboplatin/cisplatin and etoposide (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03699956). Studies from multiple independent groups have now confirmed that RRx-001 is safe and well tolerated in humans. Additionally, emerging evidence in preclinical animal models suggests that RRx-001 could be effective in a wide range of diseases where immune and inflammasome activation drives disease pathology.",2023,"Animals; Humans; Inflammasomes; NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein; Inflammation; Nucleotides",35

Gene mutations involving mRNA splicing and epigenetic regulatory pathways induce inflammasome activation and myeloid lineage skewing in MDSs through undefined mechanisms. Using immortalized murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells harboring these somatic gene mutations and primary MDS BM specimens, we showed accumulation of unresolved R-loops and micronuclei with concurrent activation of the cytosolic sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of IFN genes (cGAS/STING) signaling caused ISG induction, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and maturation of the effector protease caspase-1. Deregulation of RNA polymerase III drove cytosolic R-loop generation, which upon inhibition, extinguished ISG and inflammasome response. Mechanistically, caspase-1 degraded the master erythroid transcription factor, GATA binding protein 1, provoking anemia and myeloid lineage bias that was reversed by cGAS inhibition in vitro and in Tet2-/- hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell-transplanted mice.

Kinsenoside (KD), naturally isolated from Anoectochilus roxburghii, possesses multiple biological activities, including lipolysis, anti-inflammation, and hepatoprotection. However, the effects of KD on NASH remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the roles of KD in NASH and its engaged mechanisms. Two typical animal models of NASH, mice fed a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet (representing non-obese NASH) and mice fed a high-fat and -fructose diet (HFFD) (representing obese NASH), were used to investigate the effect of KD on NASH in vivo. Transcriptome sequencing was performed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of KD. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated THP-1 cells and transforming growth factor &#x3b2;1 (TGF-&#x3b2;1)-activated LX-2 cells were applied to further explore the effects and mechanisms of KD in vitro. The intragastric administration of KD remarkably alleviated MCD/HFFD-induced murine NASH almost in a dose-dependent manner. Specifically, KD reduced lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver of NASH mice. KD ameliorated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) abnormalities. In addition, it decreased the level of serum proinflammatory factors (IL-12p70, IL-6, TNF-&#x3b1;, MCP-1, IFN-&#x3b3;) and the hepatic expression of typical fibrosis-related molecules (&#x3b1;-SMA, Col-I, TIMP-1). Mechanically, KD attenuated the MCD/HFFD-induced NASH through the inhibition of the NF-&#x3ba;B/NLRP3 signaling pathway. Consistently, KD reduced inflammation stimulated by LPS in THP-1 cells via suppressing the NF-&#x3ba;B/NLRP3 pathway. Furthermore, it prevented the activation of LX-2 cells directly, by inhibiting the proliferation stimulated by TGF-&#x3b2;1, and indirectly, by inactivating the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. For the first time, the practical improvement of NASH by KD was revealed. Our study found that KD exerted its alleviative effects on NASH through the inhibition of the NF-&#x3ba;B/NLRP3 signaling pathway.

35743288,NLRP3,10.3390/ijms23126846,Age and Chronodisruption in Mouse Heart: Effect of the NLRP3 Inflammasome and Melatonin Therapy.,"Age and age-dependent inflammation are two main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Aging can also affect clock gene-related impairments such as chronodisruption and has been linked to a decline in melatonin synthesis and aggravation of the NF-&#x3ba;B/NLRP3 innate immune response known as inflammaging. The molecular drivers of these mechanisms remain unknown. This study investigated the impact of aging and NLRP3 expression on the cardiac circadian system, and the actions of melatonin as a potential therapy to restore daily rhythms by mitigating inflammaging. We analyzed the circadian expression and rhythmicity of clock genes in heart tissue of wild-type and NLRP3-knockout mice at 3, 12, and 24 months of age, with and without melatonin treatment. Our results support that aging, NLRP3 inflammasome, and melatonin affected the cardiac clock genes expression, except for <i>Rev-erb&#x3b1;</i>, which was not influenced by genotype. Aging caused small phase changes in <i>Clock</i>, loss of rhythmicity in <i>Per2</i> and <i>Ror&#x3b1;</i>, and mesor dampening of <i>Clock</i>, <i>Bmal1</i>, and <i>Per2</i>. NLRP3 inflammasome influenced the acrophase of <i>Clock</i>, <i>Per2</i>, and <i>Ror&#x3b1;</i>. Melatonin restored the acrophase and the rhythm of clock genes affected by age or NLRP3 activation. The administration of melatonin re-established murine cardiac homeostasis by reversing age-associated chronodisruption. Altogether, these results highlight new findings about the effects aging and NLRP3 inflammasome have on clock genes in cardiac tissue, pointing to continuous melatonin as a promising therapy to placate inflammaging and restore circadian rhythm in heart muscle. Additionally, light microscopy analysis showed age-related morphological impairments in cardiomyocytes, which were less severe in mice lacking NLRP3.

However, predictive preclinical animal models to recapitulate the spectrum of human CH are lacking. Through error-corrected sequencing of 56 human CH/myeloid malignancy genes, we identified natural CH driver mutations in aged rhesus macaques matching genes somatically mutated in human CH, with DNMT3A mutations being the most frequent. A CH model in young adult macaques was generated via autologous transplantation of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9-mediated gene-edited hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), targeting the top human CH genes with loss-of-function (LOF) mutations. Long-term follow-up revealed reproducible and significant expansion of multiple HSPC clones with heterozygous TET2 LOF mutations, compared with minimal expansion of clones bearing other mutations. Although the blood counts of these CH macaques were normal, their bone marrows were hypercellular and myeloid-predominant. TET2-disrupted myeloid colony-forming units isolated from these animals showed a distinct hyperinflammatory gene expression profile compared with wild type. In addition, mature macrophages purified from the CH macaques showed elevated NLRP3 inflammasome activity and increased interleukin-1&#x3b2; (IL-1&#x3b2;) and IL-6 production. The model was used to test the impact of IL-6 blockage by tocilizumab, documenting a slowing of TET2-mutated expansion, suggesting that interruption of the IL-6 axis may remove the selective advantage of mutant HSPCs. These findings provide a model for examining the pathophysiology of CH and give insights into potential therapeutic interventions.",2022,"Humans; Young Adult; Animals; Aged; Clonal Hematopoiesis; Hematopoiesis; Interleukin-1beta; Inflammasomes; NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein; Macaca mulatta; CRISPR-Associated Protein 9; Interleukin-6; Clone Cells; DNA-Binding Proteins; Dioxygenases",35

In advanced stage breast cancer, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x3b2; is overexpressed due to large proportions of activated myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we demonstrate the role of the host nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich containing family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in metastatic breast cancer. In vitro, we show that stimulation of THP-1 cells with conditioned media collected from MDA-MB-468 cells induced NLRP3 activation and increased Pdcd1l1 expression. In vivo, mice deficient in NLRP3 orthotopically implanted with metastatic breast cancer cell line (E0771) showed significant reduction in tumor growth (p &lt; 0.05) and increased survival (p &lt; 0.01). Inhibition of NLRP3 with the small molecule OLT1177&#xae; reduced expression of Pdcd1l1 (p &lt; 0.001), Casp1 (p &lt; 0.01) and Il1b (p &lt; 0.01) in primary tumors.

NLRP3 inhibition in addition to anti-PD-1 treatment significantly reduced tumor growth from the monotherapies (p &lt; 0.05). These data define NLRP3 activation as a key driver of immune suppression in metastatic breast cancers. Furthermore, this study suggests NLRP3 as a valid target to increase efficacy of immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitor in metastatic breast cancers.",2023,IL-1&#x3b2;; NLRP3; anti-PD-1; breast cancer; immunosuppression,35

Blocking either viral replication with remdesivir<sup>21-23</sup> or the downstream IFN-stimulated cascade with anti-IFNAR2 antibodies in vivo in the chronic stages of disease attenuates the overactive immune inflammatory response, especially inflammatory macrophages. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in lung-resident human macrophages is a critical driver of disease. In response to infection mediated by CD16 and ACE2 receptors, human macrophages activate inflammasomes, release interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-18, and undergo pyroptosis, thereby contributing to the hyperinflammatory state of the lungs. Inflammasome activation and the accompanying inflammatory response are necessary for lung inflammation, as inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway reverses chronic lung pathology. Notably, this blockade of inflammasome activation leads to the release of infectious virus by the infected macrophages. Thus, inflammasomes oppose host infection by SARS-CoV-2 through the production of inflammatory cytokines and suicide by pyroptosis to prevent a productive viral cycle.",2022,"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; Animals; COVID-19; Humans; Inflammasomes; Interleukin-1; Interleukin-18; Lung; Macrophages; Mice; NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein; Pneumonia; Pyroptosis; Receptors, IgG; SARS-CoV-2",35

Here, we generated human models of AGS using genetically modified and patient-derived pluripotent stem cells harboring TREX1 or RNASEH2B loss-of-function alleles. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis reveals that spontaneous proinflammatory activation in AGS astrocytes initiates signaling cascades impacting multiple CNS cell subsets analyzed at the single-cell level. We identify accumulating DNA damage, with elevated R-loop and micronuclei formation, as a driver of STING- and NLRP3-related inflammatory responses leading to the secretion of neurotoxic mediators. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of proapoptotic or inflammatory cascades in AGS astrocytes prevents neurotoxicity without apparent impact on their increased type I IFN responses. Together, our work identifies DNA damage as a major driver of neurotoxic inflammation in AGS astrocytes, suggests a role for AGS gene products in R-loop homeostasis, and identifies common denominators of disease that can be targeted to prevent astrocyte-mediated neurotoxicity in AGS.",2022,Astrocytes; Autoimmune Diseases of the Nervous System; DNA Damage; Humans; Inflammation; Nervous System Malformations,35

We identify beta-2-microglobulin (&#x3b2;2m) as a driver in initiating inflammation in myeloma-associated macrophages (MAMs). Lysosomal accumulation of phagocytosed &#x3b2;2m promotes &#x3b2;2m amyloid aggregation in MAMs, resulting in lysosomal rupture and ultimately production of active interleukin-1&#x3b2; (IL-1&#x3b2;) and IL-18. This process depends on activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome after &#x3b2;2m accumulation, as macrophages from NLRP3-deficient mice lack efficient &#x3b2;2m-induced IL-1&#x3b2; production. Moreover, depletion or silencing of &#x3b2;2m in MM cells abrogates inflammasome activation in a murine MM model. Finally, we demonstrate that disruption of NLRP3 or IL-18 diminishes tumor growth and osteolytic bone destruction normally promoted by &#x3b2;2m-induced inflammasome signaling.

However, the mechanism behind this remains unclear. In this study, we found that 5-HT levels, as well as the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), the 5-HT biosynthesis rate-limiting enzyme, were significantly upregulated in colorectal tumor tissues from patients with colorectal cancer, colorectal cancer mouse models, and colorectal cancer cell lines when compared with normal colorectal tissues or epithelial cell lines. Colorectal cancer cell-originated 5-HT enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in THP-1 cells and immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDM) via its ion channel receptor, HTR3A. Mechanistically, HTR3A activation led to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, followed by CaMKII&#x3b1; phosphorylation (Thr286) and activation, which then induced NLRP3 phosphorylation at Ser198 (mouse: Ser194) and inflammasome assembling. The NLRP3 inflammasome mediated IL1&#x3b2; maturation, and release upregulated 5-HT biosynthesis in colorectal cancer cells by inducing <i>TPH1</i> transcription, revealing a positive feedback loop between 5-HT and NLRP3 signaling. Silencing TPH1 or HTR3A by short hairpin RNA slowed down tumor growth in an established CT26 and iBMDM coimplanted subcutaneous allograft colorectal cancer mouse model, whereas treatment with TPH1 inhibitor 4-chloro-DL-phenylalanine or HTR3A antagonist tropisetron alleviated tumor progression in an azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate-induced colorectal cancer mouse model.

Various stimuli, such as microbial infection, misfolded protein aggregates, and aberrant deposition of proteins can induce NLRP3 inflammasome in neural cells. Once triggered, the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to the activation of caspase-1, which in turn activates inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1&#x3b2; and interleukin -18, and induces pyroptotic cell death. Mitochondria are critically involved in diverse cellular processes and are involved in regulating cellular redox status, calcium levels, inflammasome activation, and cell death. Mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid, and other mitochondria-associated proteins and lipids play vital roles in the instigation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, the processes of mitochondrial dynamics, such as fission and fusion, are essential in the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and their imbalance also promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In this connection, mitophagy-mediated maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis restricts NLRP3 inflammasome hyperactivation and its consequences in various neurological disorders. Hence, mitophagy can be exploited as a potential strategy to target damaged mitochondria induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its lethal consequences. Therefore, the identification of novel mitophagy modulators has promising therapeutic potential for NLRP3 inflammasome-associated neuronal diseases.",2021,"Inflammasome; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial dynamics; Mitophagy; NLRP3; Animals; Humans; Inflammasomes; Inflammation; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Dynamics; Mitochondrial Proteins; Mitophagy; NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein",35

Thus, tools that may add to current diagnostic practices could aid in disease discrimination. Constitutive innate immune activation is a pathogenetic driver of ineffective hematopoiesis in MDS through Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)-inflammasome-induced pyroptotic cell death. Oxidized mitochondrial DNA (ox-mtDNA) is released upon cytolysis, acts as a danger signal, and triggers inflammasome oligomerization via DNA sensors. By using immortalized bone marrow cells from murine models of common MDS somatic gene mutations and MDS primary samples, we demonstrate that ox-mtDNA is released upon pyroptosis. ox-mtDNA was significantly increased in MDS peripheral blood (PB) plasma compared with the plasma of healthy donors, and it was significantly higher in lower-risk MDS vs higher-risk MDS, consistent with the greater pyroptotic cell fraction in lower-risk patients. Furthermore, ox-mtDNA was significantly higher in MDS PB plasma compared with all other hematologic malignancies studied, with the exception of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Receiver operating characteristic/area under the curve (ROC/AUC) analysis demonstrated that ox-mtDNA is a sensitive and specific biomarker for patients with MDS compared with healthy donors (AUC, 0.964), other hematologic malignancies excluding CLL (AUC, 0.893), and reactive conditions (AUC, 0.940). ox-mtDNA positively and significantly correlated with levels of known alarmins S100A9, S100A8, and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing caspase recruitment domain (CARD) specks, which provide an index of medullary pyroptosis. Collectively, these data indicate that quantifiable ox-mtDNA released into the extracellular space upon inflammasome activation serves as a biomarker for MDS and the magnitude of pyroptotic cell death.",2021,"Animals; Biomarkers; DNA, Mitochondrial; Humans; Inflammasomes; Mice; Myelodysplastic Syndromes; Pyroptosis",35
33549591,NLRP3,10.1016/j.taap.2021.115444,Health disparities: Intracellular consequences of social determinants of health.,"Health disparities exist dependent on socioeconomic status, living conditions, race/ethnicity, diet, and exposures to environmental pollutants. Herein, the various exposures contributing to a person's exposome are collectively considered social determinants of health (SDOH), and the SDOH-exposome impacts health more than health care. This review discusses the extent of evidence of the physiologic consequences of these exposures at the intracellular level. We consider how the SDOH-exposome, which captures how individuals live, work and age, induces cell processes that modulate a conceptual ""redox rheostat."" Like an electrical resistor, the SDOH-exposome, along with genetic predisposition and age, regulate reductive and oxidative (redox) stress circuits and thereby stimulate inflammation. Regardless of the source of the SDOH-exposome that induces chronic inflammation and immunosenescence, the outcome influences cardiometabolic diseases, cancers, infections, sepsis, neurodegeneration and autoimmune diseases. The endogenous redox rheostat is connected with regulatory molecules such as NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH and SIRT1 that drive redox pathways. In addition to these intracellular and mitochondrial processes, we discuss how the SDOH-exposome can influence the balance between metabolism and regulation of immune responsiveness involving the two main molecular drivers of inflammation, the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-&#x3ba;B induction. Mitochondrial and inflammasome activities play key roles in mediating defenses against pathogens and controlling inflammation before diverse cell death pathways are induced. Specifically, pyroptosis, cell death by inflammation, is intimately associated with common disease outcomes that are influenced by the SDOH-exposome. Redox influences on immunometabolism including protein cysteines and ion fluxes are discussed regarding health outcomes. In summary, this review presents a translational research perspective, with evidence from in vitro and in vivo models as well as clinical and epidemiological studies, to outline the intracellular consequences of the SDOH-exposome that drive health disparities in patients and populations. The relevance of this conceptual and theoretical model considering the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are highlighted. Finally, the case of asthma is presented as a chronic condition that is modified by adverse SDOH exposures and is manifested through the dysregulation of immune cell redox regulatory processes we highlight in this review.",2021,"Environmental Pollutants; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Intracellular Fluid; Oxidative Stress; Social Determinants of Health; Translational Research, Biomedical",35

Especially where the inflammation is mediated by cells of the innate immune system, the NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role, as it senses and responds to a variety of exogenous and endogenous pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The NLRP3 inflammasome is responsible for the maturation and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1&#x3b2; (IL-1&#x3b2;) and IL-18 and for the induction of a type of inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis. Overactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can be a driver of various diseases. Since leukemia is known to be an inflammation-driven cancer and IL-1&#x3b2; is produced in elevated levels by leukemic cells, research on NLRP3 in the context of leukemia has increased in recent years.

Although experimental studies suggest that DNMT3A clonal hematopoiesis-driver mutations may enhance inflammation, specific signatures of inflammatory cells in humans are missing. To define subsets of immune cells mediating inflammation in humans using single-cell RNA sequencing. Transcriptomic profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed in n=6 patients with HF harboring DNMT3A clonal hematopoiesis-driver mutations and n=4 patients with HF and no DNMT3A mutations by single-cell RNA sequencing. Monocytes of patients with HF carrying DNMT3A mutations demonstrated a significantly increased expression of inflammatory genes compared with monocytes derived from patients with HF without DNMT3A mutations. Among the specific upregulated genes were the prototypic inflammatory IL (interleukin) <i>IL1B (interleukin 1B), IL6, IL8</i>, the inflammasome <i>NLRP3</i>, and the macrophage inflammatory proteins <i>CCL3</i> and <i>CCL4</i> as well as resistin, which augments monocyte-endothelial adhesion. Silencing of DNMT3A in monocytes induced a paracrine proinflammatory activation and increased adhesion to endothelial cells. Furthermore, the classical monocyte subset of DNMT3A mutation carriers showed increased expression of T-cell stimulating immunoglobulin superfamily members <i>CD300LB</i>, <i>CD83</i>, <i>SIGLEC12</i>, as well as the CD2 ligand and cell adhesion molecule <i>CD58</i>, all of which may be involved in monocyte-T-cell interactions.

We selected 56 grade 1-3A FL patients according to their need of treatment or timing of relapse: never treated (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;7), non-relapsed (19), late relapse (14), early relapse or POD24 (11), and primary refractory (5). We analyzed 56 diagnostic and 12 paired relapse lymphoid tissue biopsies and performed copy number alteration (CNA) analysis and next generation sequencing (NGS). We identified six focal driver losses (1p36.32, 6p21.32, 6q14.1, 6q23.3, 9p21.3, 10q23.33) and 1p36.33 copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH). By integrating CNA and NGS results, the most frequently altered genes/regions were KMT2D (79%), CREBBP (67%), TNFRSF14 (46%) and BCL2 (40%). Although we found that mutations in PIM1, FOXO1 and TMEM30A were associated with an adverse clinical behavior, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn, due to the small sample size. We identified common precursor cells harboring early oncogenic alterations of the KMT2D, CREBBP, TNFRSF14 and EP300 genes and 16p13.3-p13.2 CN-LOH.

Despite some progress in targeted therapies for HER2, FGFR2, EGFR, MET, Claudin 18.2 and immune checkpoints in ACGEJ tumors, the 5-year survival rate of patients remains poor. Thus, it is urgent to explore genomic alterations and neoantigen characteristics of tumors and identify CD8+ T-cell infiltration-associated genes to find potential therapeutic targets and develop a risk model to predict ACGEJ patients' overall survival (OS). Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 55 paired samples from Chinese ACGEJ patients. Somatic mutations and copy number variations were detected by Strelka2 and FACETS, respectively. SigProfiler and SciClone were employed to decipher the mutation signature and clonal structure of each sample, respectively. Neoantigens were predicted using the MuPeXI pipeline. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of ACGEJ samples from our previous studies and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to identify genes significantly associated with CD8+ T-cell infiltration by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). To construct a risk model, we conducted LASSO and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Recurrent <i>MAP2K7</i>, <i>RNF43</i> and <i>RHOA</i> mutations were found in ACGEJ tumors. The COSMIC signature SBS17 was associated with ACGEJ progression. <i>CCNE1</i> and <i>VEGFA</i> were identified as putative CNV driver genes. <i>PI3KCA</i> and <i>TP53</i> mutations conferred selective advantages to cancer cells. The Chinese ACGEJ patient neoantigen landscape was revealed for the first time, and 58 potential neoantigens common to TSNAdb and IEDB were identified. Compared with Siewert type II samples, Siewert type III samples had significant enrichment of the SBS17 signature, a lower <i>TNFRSF14</i> copy number, a higher proportion of samples with complex clonal architecture and a higher neoantigen load.

Patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups based on whether lymphoma progressed within 24&#xa0;months. Genes showing significantly different frequencies between groups were selected. Survival data for patients with the selected mutant genes were analyzed. The results were validated using two other large databases to evaluate the relationship between the selected mutant genes and prognosis. The mutation frequencies of 11 genes (MYD88[L265P], SGK1, MPEG1, TP53, SPEN, NOTCH1, ETV6, TNFRSF14, MGA, CIITA, and PIM1) significantly differed between the high- and low-risk groups. The relationships between these mutant genes and patient survival were analyzed. Patients who harbored SGK1 (serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1) mutations exhibited the best prognosis. Most patients with SGK1 mutation are germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype. Among patients with GCB DLBCL, those harboring SGK1 mutations exhibited better prognosis than those without SGK1 mutations. Most SGK1 mutations were single-base substitutions, primarily scattered throughout the catalytic domain-encoding region. Multiple SGK1 mutations were identified in a single patient. Thus, SGK1 mutations are a marker of good prognosis for DLBCL and occur predominantly in the GCB subtype of DLBCL. SGK1 mutation status can further stratify patients with GCB DLBCL into different prognostic subgroups.",2022,"SGK1; classification; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; genetics; prognosis; B-Lymphocytes; Germinal Center; Humans; Immediate-Early Proteins; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse; Mutation; Prognosis; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases",8

While some ISFNs are associated with overt FL, others are incidentally identified as isolated or pure forms in individuals without evidence of overt FL. The prevalence of incidentally found isolated ISFN is approximately 3% in Europe; however, no screening study has been conducted in Asia. To investigate the incidence and clinicopathological characteristics of ISFNs in the Japanese population, we conducted histopathological screening of the lymph nodes (LNs) resected for solid tumours or inflammatory conditions. We screened for ISFN in 5700 LNs from 340 individuals using immunohistochemistry for BCL2 and identified seven ISFNs, with an incidence of 2.1%. The median age of the individuals with ISFN was 67&#x2009;years, none of whom developed overt FL, with a median follow-up of 59&#x2009;months. Next-generation sequencing was performed in five ISFNs, and 10 variants in seven FL-associated genes were identified. The identified variants included HIST1H1E (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2), ARID1A (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2), KMT2D (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), CARD11 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), BCL7A (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), CREBBP (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1) and TNFRSF14 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1). The incidence of isolated ISFN in the Japanese population is not significantly different from that in Europe, presumably reflecting the recent increase in FL in Japan. These incidentally found ISFNs have a low potential to transform into overt FL. Although mutations of FL-associated genes are already present in ISFNs, further molecular studies are needed to identify driver genes leading to the transformation of ISFN to overt FL.",2022,"BCL2; CREBBP; follicular lymphoma; in-situ follicular B-cell neoplasm; in-situ follicular neoplasia; Aged; Carcinoma in Situ; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Follow-Up Studies; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Incidence; Japan; Lymph Nodes; Lymphoma, Follicular; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence",8

Whether DDR-related alterations relate to therapeutic response and prognosis in lung cancer lacking oncogenic drivers remains unknown. Pretherapeutic cancer samples of 122 patients [86 non-small cell lung cancer and 36 small cell lung cancer (SCLC)] harboring no <i>EGFR/ALK</i> alterations were collected. Through whole-exome sequencing, we outlined DDR mutational landscape and determined relationships between DDR gene alterations and TMB or intratumoral heterogeneity. Then, we evaluated the impacts of DDR gene alterations on therapeutic response and prognosis and established a DDR-based model for prognosis prediction. In addition, we investigated somatic interactions of DDR genes and immunomodulatory genes, immune expression patterns, immune microenvironment, and immune infiltration characteristics between DDR-deficient and DDR-proficient samples. Samples from cBioportal datasets were utilized for verification. We found that deleterious DDR gene alterations were closely associated with higher TMB than proficient-types (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). DDR mechanisms attach great importance to the determination of patients' prognosis after chemotherapy, and alterations of base excision repair pathway in adenocarcinoma, nucleotide excision repair in squamous carcinoma, and homologous recombination pathway in SCLC tend to associate with worse progression-free survival to first-line chemotherapy (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). A predictive nomogram model was constructed incorporating DDR-related alterations, clinical stage, and smoking status, with the area under curve values of 0.692-0.789 for 1- and 2-year receiver operating characteristic curves in training and testing cohorts. Furthermore, DDR-altered tumors contained enhanced frequencies of alterations in various genes of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I pathway including <i>TAP1</i> and <i>TAP2</i> than DDR-proficient samples. DDR-deficient types had lower expressions of STING1 (<i>p</i> = 0.01), CD28 (<i>p</i> = 0.020), HLA-DRB6 (<i>p</i> = 0.014) in adenocarcinoma, lower TNFRSF4 (<i>p</i> = 0.017), and TGFB1 expressions (<i>p</i> = 0.033) in squamous carcinoma, and higher CD40 (<i>p</i> = 0.012) and TNFRSF14 expressions <i>(p</i> = 0.022) in SCLC. DDR alteration enhanced activated mast cells in adenocarcinoma (<i>p</i> = 0.044) and M2 macrophage in squamous carcinoma (<i>p</i> = 0.004) than DDR-proficient types. Collectively, DDR gene alterations in lung cancer without oncogenic drivers are positively associated with high TMB.

Multiple efforts have focused on the determination of the genomic drivers of B-cell lymphoma subtypes. In the meantime, the aggregation of diverse tumors in pan-cancer genomic studies has become a useful tool to detect new driver genes, while enabling the comparison of mutational patterns across tumors. Here we present an integrated analysis of 354 B-cell lymphoid disorders. 112 recurrently mutated genes were discovered, of which KMT2D, CREBBP, IGLL5 and BCL2 were the most frequent, and 31 genes were putative new drivers. Mutations in CREBBP, TNFRSF14 and KMT2D predominated in follicular lymphoma, whereas those in BTG2, HTA-A and PIM1 were more frequent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Additionally, we discovered 31 significantly mutated protein networks, reinforcing the role of genes such as CREBBP, EEF1A1, STAT6, GNA13 and TP53, but also pointing towards a myriad of infrequent players in lymphomagenesis. Finally, we report aberrant expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors associated with novel noncoding mutations (DTX1 and S1PR2), and new recurrent copy number aberrations affecting immune check-point regulators (CD83, PVR) and B-cell specific genes (TNFRSF13C).

We identified recurrent mutations in genes that are well known to be functionally relevant in DLBCL, including MYD88, CARD11, EZH2, and CREBBP. We also identified somatic mutations in genes for which a functional role in DLBCL has not been previously suspected. These genes include MEF2B, MLL2, BTG1, GNA13, ACTB, P2RY8, PCLO, and TNFRSF14. Further, we show that BCL2 mutations commonly occur in patients with BCL2/IgH rearrangements as a result of somatic hypermutation normally occurring at the IgH locus. The BCL2 point mutations are primarily synonymous, and likely caused by activation-induced cytidine deaminase-mediated somatic hypermutation, as shown by comprehensive analysis of enrichment of mutations in WRCY target motifs. Those nonsynonymous mutations that are observed tend to be found outside of the functionally important BH domains of the protein, suggesting that strong negative selection against BCL2 loss-of-function mutations is at play. Last, by using an algorithm designed to identify likely functionally relevant but infrequent mutations, we identify KRAS, BRAF, and NOTCH1 as likely drivers of DLBCL pathogenesis in some patients. Our data provide an unbiased view of the landscape of mutations in DLBCL, and this in turn may point toward new therapeutic strategies for the disease.",2012,"Amino Acid Motifs; Cluster Analysis; DNA Mutational Analysis; Exome; Exons; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse; Models, Genetic; Mutation; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Translocation, Genetic",8

The new gene fusion involves the 5'-end of the promoter-containing N terminus of the SOX5 gene fused to exons 7-16 of the 3'-end of RAF1 gene leading to a SOX5-RAF1 fusion transcript which loses the auto-inhibitory CR1 domain but retains the complete in-frame coding sequence for the C-Terminal kinase domain of the RAF1. Stable expression of SOX5-RAF1 fusion induced growth factor-independent cell growth in murine hematopoietic Ba/F3 cells and melan-a immortalized melanocytes. Besides, it led to the transformation of both Ba/F3 and NIH 3T3 cells as revealed by colony formation assays. Furthermore, its expression results in MAPK activation assessed by increased levels of p-ERK protein in the cytosol of transduced cells. Treatment with Sorafenib and UO126 inhibited proliferation of Ba/F3-SOX5-RAF1 cells in the absence of IL3 but not the PLX 4720, a specific inhibitor of BRAF. Moreover, the tumorigenic and metastatic capacities of SOX5-RAF1 were assessed in vivo. These results indicate that SOX5-RAF1, a driver event for CMN development, has oncogenic capacity. Thus, sequencing of CMN transcriptomes may lead to the identification of this druggable fusion and interfere with the progression toward melanoma.",2022,"Giant Congenital Melanocytic Nevi; MAPK activation; SOX5-RAF1 gene fusion; metastasis; oncogenic properties; Animals; Gene Fusion; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mice; Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins; Mutation; Nevus, Pigmented; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf; SOXD Transcription Factors; Skin Neoplasms",6

Prolonging the duration of remission with minimal nonrelapse mortality risk is an area of unmet need for AML patients. In QUAZAR AML-001 study, the oral azacitidine analogue CC-486 demonstrated an overall survival (OS) benefit when given as postremission therapy (PRT) for patients in CR1 that were ineligible to proceed to allo-HCT. Used as maintenance post allo-HCT, CC-486 has also shown safety with encouraging disease-free survival (DFS). Although a recent randomized trial of parenteral azacitidine vs. placebo post allo-HCT failed to show relapse reduction, a subsequent meta-analysis of maintenance studies posttransplant has shown good utility with this approach. Such conflicting results emphasize the need for robust study designs to identify subsets of patients that derive maximal benefits using latest tools to risk stratify relapse risk. PRT with hypomethylating agents is feasible and in select population, there is a survival advantage with CC-486. Better understanding of distinct epigenetic and immunomodulatory properties of azacitidine, holds significant promise to synergize pharmacologic and cellular drivers of disease control as PRT in future AML trials.",2022,"Azacitidine; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Recurrence; Remission Induction",6
34873486,CR1,,Branching clonal evolution patterns predominate mutational landscape in multiple myeloma.,"Multiple Myeloma (MM) arises from malignant transformation and deregulated proliferation of clonal plasma cells (PCs) harbouring heterogeneous molecular anomalies. The effect of evolving mutations on clone fitness and their cellular prevalence shapes the progressing myeloma genome and impacts clinical outcomes. Although clonal heterogeneity in MM is well established, which subclonal mutations emerge/persist/perish with progression in MM and which of these can be targeted therapeutically remains an open question. In line with this, we have sequenced pairwise whole exomes of 62 MM patients collected at two time points, i.e., at diagnosis and on progression. Somatic variants were called using a novel ensemble approach where a consensus was deduced from four variant callers (Illumina's Dragen, Strelka2, SomaticSniper and SpeedSeq) and actionable/druggable gene targets were identified. A marked intraclonal heterogeneity was observed. Branching evolution was observed among 72.58% patients, of whom 64.51% had low TMBs (&lt;10) and 61.29% had 2 or more founder clones. The hypermutator patients (with high TMB levels &#x2265;10 to &#x2264;100) showed a significant decrease in their TMBs from diagnosis (median TMB 77.11) to progression (median TMB 31.22). A distinct temporal fall in subclonal driver mutations was identified recurrently across diagnosis to progression e.g., in <i>PABPC1, BRAF, KRAS, CR1, DIS3</i> and <i>ATM</i> genes in 3 or more patients suggesting such patients could be treated early with target specific drugs like Vemurafenib/Cobimetinib. An analogous rise in driver mutations was observed in <i>KMT2C, FOXD4L1, SP140, NRAS</i> and other genes. A few drivers such as <i>FAT4, IGLL5</i> and <i>CDKN1A</i> retained consistent distribution patterns at two time points.

Recent studies have defined the landscape of genomic alterations of gastric cancer and their association with clinical outcomes. However, the pathogenesis of gastric cancer has not been completely characterised. Driver genes were detected by five computational tools, MutSigCV, OncodriveCLUST, OncodriveFM, dendrix and edriver, using mutation data of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) from the cancer genome altas database, followed by an integrative investigation. <i>TTN, TP53, LRP1B, CSMD3, OBSCN, ARID1A, FAT4, FLG, PCLO</i> and <i>CSMD1</i> were the 10 most frequently mutated genes. <i>PIK3CD, NLRC3, FMNL1, TRAF3IP3</i> and <i>CR1</i> were the top five hub genes of the blue coexpression module positively correlated with pathological tumour stage and lymph node stage (p values &lt;0.05 for all cases).

However, acquired resistance to TKIs invariably develops within approximately 1 year of treatment by various mechanisms, including gatekeeper mutations, alternative pathway activation and histological transformations. Because immunotherapy is an option for patients with drug-resistant cancers, we generated several TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines in vitro, and then evaluated the cytotoxicity of NK92-CD16 cells to these resistant cells. TKI-resistant NSCLC cells (H3122CR1, H3122LR1, H3122CR1LR1, PC-9GR, PC-9ER, EBC-CR1 and EBC-CR2) were established from NCI-H3122 (EML4-ALK fusion), PC-9 (EGFR exon19 deletion) and EBC-1 (MET amplification) after continuous exposure to crizotinib, ceritinib, gefitinib, erlotinib and capmatinib. Expression of ligands for natural killer (NK) cell receptors and total EGFR were analyzed using flow cytometry. NK cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) using anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) cetuximab were measured using NK92-CD16 as effectors and detected using the <sup>51</sup>Chromium-release assay. We found that NK92-CD16 cells preferentially killed TKI-resistant NSCLC cells when compared with their parental NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) was up-regulated in the TKI-resistant NSCLC cells and patients' tumors, and the ICAM-1 up-regulated cancer cells lines were less susceptible to NK cytotoxicity by blocking ICAM-1. Moreover, NK92-CD16 cell-induced cytotoxicity toward TKI-resistant NSCLC cells was enhanced in the presence of cetuximab, an EGFR-targeting mAb. These data suggest that combinational treatment with NK cell-based immunotherapy and cetuximab may be promising for patients with TKI-resistant NSCLC.",2020,"NK92-CD16; acquired resistance; cetuximab; intracellular adhesion molecule 1; non-small cell lung cancer; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Cetuximab; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Humans; Immunotherapy, Adoptive; Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1; Killer Cells, Natural; Lung Neoplasms; Oncogenes; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Receptors, IgG",6

In studies on M&#x3a6; and DC development, OC development is generally not addressed. Furthermore, findings on DC development are confusing, because monocytes can also differentiate into DC-like cells. To resolve these issues, we have examined the development of monocytes/M&#x3a6;s, OCs, and DCs from common progenitors, using the homeostatic driver cytokines macrophage colony-stimulating factor, RANK ligand (L), and Flt3L. In mouse bone marrow, B220<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>low/-</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup>c-Fms<sup>+</sup> cells could be dissected into a CD27<sup>+</sup>Flt3<sup>+</sup> population that proved oligopotent for M&#x3a6;/OC/DC development (MODP) and a CD27<sup>low/-</sup>Flt3<sup>-</sup> population that proved bipotent for M&#x3a6;/OC development (MOP). Developmental potential and relationship of MODP and downstream MOP populations are demonstrated by differentiation cultures, functional analysis of M&#x3a6;/OC/DC offspring, and genome-wide messenger RNA expression analysis. A common DC progenitor (CDP) has been described as committed to plasmacytoid and conventional DC development. However, the human CDP proved identical to the MODP population, whereas the mouse CDP largely overlapped with the MODP population and was accordingly oligopotent for M&#x3a6;, OC, and DC development. The CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> M&#x3a6;/DC progenitor (MDP) population described in the mouse generated M&#x3a6;s and OCs but not DCs. Thus, monocytes/M&#x3a6;s, OCs, and DCs share a common progenitor that gives rise to a bipotent M&#x3a6;/OC progenitor, but a dedicated DC progenitor is currently undefined.

However, HCC recurrence rates post-OLT range from 20 to 40 %, with limited follow-up options. Elucidating genetic drivers common to primary and post-OLT recurrent tumors may further our understanding and help identify predictive biomarkers of recurrence-both to ultimately help manage clinical decisions for patients undergoing OLT. Whole exome and RNA sequencing in matched primary and recurrent tumors, normal adjacent tissues, and blood from four Chinese HCC patients was conducted. SiRNA knockdown and both qRT-PCR and Western assays were performed on PLCPRF5, SNU449 and HEPG2 cell lines; immunohistochemistry and RNA Sequencing were conducted on the primary tumors of Chinese HCC patients who experienced tumor recurrence post-OLT (n = 9) or did not experience tumor recurrence (n = 12). In three independent HCC studies of patients undergoing transplantation (n = 21) or surgical resection (n = 242, n = 44) of primary tumors (total n = 307), HERC5 mRNA under-expression correlated with shorter: time to tumor recurrence (p = 0.007 and 0.02) and overall survival (p = 0.0063 and 0.023), even after adjustment for relevant clinical variables. HERC5 loss drives CCL20 mRNA and protein over-expression and associates with regulatory T cell infiltration as measured by FOXP3 expression. Further, matched primary and recurrent tumors from the 4 HCC patients indicated clonal selection advantage of Wnt signaling activation and CDKN2A inactivation. HERC5 plays a crucial role in HCC immune evasion and has clinical relevance as a reproducible prognostic marker for risk of tumor recurrence and survival in patients.",2016,"Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; DNA Copy Number Variations; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Liver Neoplasms; Liver Transplantation; Prognosis; Recurrence",1

In this study, we used genome-wide RNA-seq to identify genes upregulated in generated radioresistant PDAC cell lines and discovered the Inhibitor of DNA Binding 1 (ID1) gene as a potential regulator of radioresistance in PDAC. <b>Materials/Methods:</b> Radioresistant clones of the PDAC cell lines MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 were generated by delivering daily ionizing irradiation (IR) (2 Gy/day) <i>in vitro</i> over two weeks (total 20 Gy) followed by standard clonogenic assays following one week from the end of IR. The generated RR and parental cell lines were submitted for RNA-seq analysis to identify differentially expressed genes. The Limma R package was used to calculate differential expression among genes. Log2 fold change values were calculated for each sample compared to the control. Genes with an absolute fold change &gt; 1 were considered significant. RNA sequencing expression data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was analyzed through the online databases GEPIA, cBioPortal, and the Human Protein Atlas. <b>Results:</b> Following exposure to two weeks of 2 Gy daily IR in vitro, the two PDAC cell lines showed significantly greater clonogenic cell survival than their parental cell lines, indicating enhanced RR in these cells. RNA-seq analysis comparing parental and RR cell lines found upregulated seven genes (TNS4, ZDHHC8P1, APLNR, AQP3, SPP1, ID1, ID2) and seven genes downregulated (PTX3, ITGB2, EPS8L1, ALDH1L2, KCNT2, ARHGAP9, IFI16) in both RR cell lines. Western blotting confirmed increased expression of the ID1 protein in the RR cell lines compared to their parental cell lines. We found that ID1 mRNA was significantly higher in PDAC tumors compared to matched normal and high ID1 expression correlated with significantly worse disease-free survival (DFS) in PDAC patients (HR = 2.2, log rank <i>P</i> = 0.009). ID1 mRNA expression was also strongly correlated in tumors with TP53 mutation, a known driver of radioresistance. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our analysis indicates a novel role of ID1 in PDAC radioresistance. ID1 expression is higher in tumor tissue compared to normal, and high expression correlates with both worse DFS and association with the TP53 mutation, suggesting that targeting ID1 prior to IR is an attractive strategy for overcoming radioresistance in PDAC.",2023,ID1; Pancreatic cancer; RNA-seq; radiation resistance,2

However, the aetiology of PRAD remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, 333 driver genes were identified using four computational tools: OncodriveFM, OncodriveCLUST, iCAGES and DrGaP. In addition, 32 driver pathways were identified using DrGaP. SPOP, TP53, SPTA1, AHNAK, HMCN1, ATM, FOXA1, CSMD3, LRP1B and FREM2 were the 10 most recurrently mutated genes in PRAD. ITGAL, TAGAP, SIGLEC10, RAC2 and ITGA4 were the five hub genes in the yellow module that were associated with the number of positive lymph nodes. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the 20 driver genes with the most frequent CNVs revealed three clusters of patients with PRAD.

We used whole exome sequence data from triplet samples (colon carcinoma, colon adenoma, and normal tissue) from 18 individuals to assess gene mutation rates. Of the 2&#xa0;204 genes that were mutated, APC, TTN, TP53, KRAS, OBSCN, SOX9, PCDH17, SIGLEC10, MYH6, and BRD9 were consistent with genes being an early driver of carcinogenesis, in that they were mutated in multiple adenomas and multiple carcinomas. Fifty-two genes were mutated in &#x2265;12.5% of microsatellite stable (MSS) carcinomas but not in any of the adenomas, in line with the profile of a late driver event involved in tumor progression. Thirty-eight genes were sequenced in a larger independent set of 148 carcinoma/normal tissue pairs to obtain more precise mutation frequencies. Eight of the genes, APC, TP53, ATM, CSMD3, LRP1B, RYR2, BIRC6, and MUC17, contained mutations in &gt;20% of the carcinomas. Interestingly, mutations in four genes in addition to APC that are associated with dysregulation of Wnt signaling, were all classified as early driver events. Most of the genes that are commonly associated with colon cancer, including APC, TP53, and KRAS, were all classified as being early driver genes being mutated in both adenomas and carcinomas. Classifying genes as potential early and late driver events points to candidate genes that may help dissect pathways involved in both tumor initiation and progression.",2018,adenoma; colon cancer; mutation; whole exome sequencing; Adenoma; Aged; Carcinogenesis; Carcinoma; Colonic Neoplasms; Disease Progression; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Exome Sequencing,2

In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of paired circulating CLL (PB-CLL) and RS biopsies (tissue-RS) from 17 patients recruited into a clinical trial (CHOP-O). We found that tissue-RS was enriched for mutations in poor-risk CLL drivers and genes in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. In addition, we identified genomic aberrations not previously implicated in RS, including the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor (PTPRD) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3). In the noncoding genome, we discovered activation-induced cytidine deaminase-related and unrelated kataegis in tissue-RS affecting regulatory regions of key immune-regulatory genes. These include BTG2, CXCR4, NFATC1, PAX5, NOTCH-1, SLC44A5, FCRL3, SELL, TNIP2, and TRIM13. Furthermore, differences between the global mutation signatures of pairs of PB-CLL and tissue-RS samples implicate DDR as the dominant mechanism driving transformation. Pathway-based clonal deconvolution analysis showed that genes in the MAPK and DDR pathways demonstrate high clonal-expansion probability. Direct comparison of nodal-CLL and tissue-RS pairs from an independent cohort confirmed differential expression of the same pathways by RNA expression profiling. Our integrated analysis of WGS and RNA expression data significantly extends previous targeted approaches, which were limited by the lack of germline samples, and it facilitates the identification of novel genomic correlates implicated in RS transformation, which could be targeted therapeutically.

To date, human immunopathogenic studies of immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) have relied on sampling of circulating peripheral blood cells rather than affected tissues. Here, we directly obtained thyroid specimens from individuals with ICI-thyroiditis, one of the most common IRAEs, and compared immune infiltrates with those from individuals with spontaneous autoimmune Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) or no thyroid disease. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a dominant, clonally expanded population of thyroid-infiltrating cytotoxic CXCR6<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) present in ICI-thyroiditis but not HT or healthy controls. Furthermore, we identified a crucial role for interleukin-21 (IL-21), a cytokine secreted by intrathyroidal T follicular (T<sub>FH</sub>) and T peripheral helper (T<sub>PH</sub>) cells, as a driver of these thyrotoxic effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In the presence of IL-21, human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells acquired the activated effector phenotype with up-regulation of the cytotoxic molecules interferon-&#x3b3; (IFN-&#x3b3;) and granzyme B, increased expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR6, and thyrotoxic capacity. We validated these findings in vivo using a mouse model of IRAEs and further demonstrated that genetic deletion of IL-21 signaling protected ICI-treated mice from thyroid immune infiltration.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an important driver of HCC. Immunotherapy has been approved for treating HCC, but biomarker-based stratification of patients for optimal response to therapy is an unmet need<sup>6,7</sup>. Here we report the progressive accumulation of exhausted, unconventionally activated CD8<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells in NASH-affected livers. In preclinical models of NASH-induced HCC, therapeutic immunotherapy targeted at programmed death-1 (PD1) expanded activated CD8<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells within tumours but did not lead to tumour regression, which indicates that tumour immune surveillance was impaired. When given prophylactically, anti-PD1 treatment led to an increase in the incidence of NASH-HCC and in the number and size of tumour nodules, which correlated with increased hepatic CD8<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup>CXCR6<sup>+</sup>, TOX<sup>+</sup>, and TNF<sup>+</sup> T cells. The increase in HCC triggered by anti-PD1 treatment was prevented by depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or TNF neutralization, suggesting that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells help to induce NASH-HCC, rather than invigorating or executing immune surveillance. We found similar phenotypic and functional profiles in hepatic CD8<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells from humans with NAFLD or NASH. A meta-analysis of three randomized phase III clinical trials that tested inhibitors of PDL1 (programmed death-ligand 1) or PD1 in more than 1,600 patients with advanced HCC revealed that immune therapy did not improve survival in patients with non-viral HCC. In two additional cohorts, patients with NASH-driven HCC who received anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 treatment showed reduced overall survival compared to patients with other aetiologies. Collectively, these data show that non-viral HCC, and particularly NASH-HCC, might be less responsive to immunotherapy, probably owing to NASH-related aberrant T cell activation causing tissue damage that leads to impaired immune surveillance. Our data provide a rationale for stratification of patients with HCC according to underlying aetiology in studies of immunotherapy as a primary or adjuvant treatment.",2021,"Animals; B7-H1 Antigen; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Carcinogenesis; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Disease Progression; Humans; Immunotherapy; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",3

Although a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program are critical, molecular mechanisms underlying the Axl-driven cancer progression have not been fully elucidated. We aimed to identify molecules up-regulated by Axl kinase in lung adenocarcinomas. Through the global gene expression analysis and the functional annotation clustering, we found that AXL expression positively correlated with mRNA expressions of immune checkpoint molecules and chemokine receptors in non-small-cell lung cancers. Validation cohorts including our biobank confirmed that the AXL expression significantly correlated with expression of genes encoding programmed death-ligand1 (PD-L1) and CXC chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6) in lung adenocarcinoma, especially in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive adenocarcinoma. Pharmacological inhibition of Axl kinase activity decreased mRNA expressions of PD-L1 and CXCR6 in EGFR mutation-positive cell lines. Our data indicates the novel role of Axl kinase as a driver of immune checkpoint molecules and chemokine signalling pathways in the progression of lung adenocarcinomas.

Polygenic score models built with TIME eQTLs reproducibly stratify cancer risk, survival and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response across independent cohorts. To assess whether an eQTL-informed approach could reveal potential cancer immunotherapy targets, we inhibit CTSS, a gene implicated by cancer risk and ICB response-associated polygenic models; CTSS inhibition results in slowed tumor growth and extended survival in vivo.

Leveraging insights from a proteomic study and publicly available transcriptomic data, we evaluated the predictive capacity of a gene panel corresponding to proteins differentially abundant between treatment-sensitive and treatment-resistant cell lines, deciphering predictors of treatment resistance and potential resistance mechanisms to BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy in patient biopsy samples. From our analysis, a 13-gene signature panel, in both test and validation datasets, could identify treatment-resistant or progressed melanoma cases with an accuracy and sensitivity of over 70%. The dysregulation of HMOX1, ICAM, MMP2, and SPARC defined a BRAF/MEK treatment-resistant landscape, with resistant cases showing a &gt;2-fold risk of expression of these genes. Furthermore, we utilized a combination of functional enrichment- and gene expression-derived scores to model and identify pathways, such as HMOX1-mediated mitochondrial stress response, as potential key drivers of the emergence of a BRAF/MEK inhibitor-resistant state in melanoma cells. Overall, our results highlight the utility of these genes in predicting treatment outcomes and the underlying mechanisms that can be targeted to reduce the development of resistance to BRAF/MEK targeted therapy.",2023,"BRAF/MEK inhibitors; aggressiveness; biomarkers; melanoma; resistance; risk stratification; Humans; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; Proteomics; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Cell Line, Tumor; Melanoma; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases",29

Reprogramming the hypoxic TAMs to antitumor phenotype holds great therapeutic benefits but remains challenging for current drugs. Here, an in situ activated nanoglycocluster is reported to realize effective tumor penetration and potent repolarization of hypoxic TAMs. Triggered by the hypoxia-upregulated matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), the nanoglycocluster is self-assembled from the administered mannose-containing precursor glycopeptides and presents densely-arrayed mannoses to multivalently engage with mannose receptors on M2-like TAMs for efficient phenotype switch. By virtue of the high diffusivity of precursor glycopeptides due to their low molecular mass and weak affinity with TAMs in perivascular regions, the nanoglycoclusters are capable of substantially accumulating in hypoxic areas to strongly interact with local TAMs. This enables the efficient repolarization of overall TAMs with a higher rate than the small-molecule drug R848 and CD40 antibody, and beneficial therapeutic effects in mouse tumor models especially when combining with PD-1 antibody.

Interleukin (IL)-30 has proven to be crucial for CSC viability and tumor progression. Whether it is involved in CRC tumorigenesis and impacts clinical behavior is unknown. IL30 production and functions, in stem and non-stem CRC cells, were determined by western blot, immunoelectron microscopy, flow cytometry, cell viability and sphere formation assays. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of the <i>IL30</i> gene, RNA-Seq and implantation of <i>IL30</i> gene transfected or deleted CR-CSCs in NSG mice allowed to investigate IL30's role in CRC oncogenesis. Bioinformatics and immunopathology of CRC samples highlighted the clinical implications. We demonstrated that both CR-CSCs and CRC cells express membrane-anchored IL30 that regulates their self-renewal, via WNT5A and RAB33A, and/or proliferation and migration, primarily by upregulating CXCR4 <i>via</i> STAT3, which are suppressed by IL30 gene deletion, along with WNT and RAS pathways. Deletion of <i>IL30</i> gene downregulates the expression of proteases, such as MMP2 and MMP13, chemokine receptors, mostly CCR7, CCR3 and CXCR4, and growth and inflammatory mediators, including ANGPT2, CXCL10, EPO, IGF1 and EGF. These factors contribute to IL30-driven CR-CSC and CRC cell expansion, which is abrogated by their selective blockade. <i>IL30</i> gene deleted CR-CSCs displayed reduced tumorigenicity and gave rise to slow-growing and low metastatic tumors in 80% of mice, which survived much longer than controls. Bioinformatics and CIBERSORTx of the '<i>Colorectal Adenocarcinoma TCGA Nature 2012</i>' collection, and morphometric assessment of IL30 expression in clinical CRC samples revealed that the lack of IL30 in CRC and infiltrating leucocytes correlates with prolonged overall survival. IL30 is a new CRC driver, since its inactivation, which disables oncogenic pathways and multiple autocrine loops, inhibits CR-CSC tumorigenicity and metastatic ability.

Angiogenic factors may be valuable indices of tumor recurrence and treatment and potentially useful markers for predicting the response to antiangiogenesis therapy. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are major drivers of tumor angiogenesis. Preoperatively predicting the expression of VEGF and MMPs is crucial for treating HCC. Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been successfully used in the differential diagnosis of HCC, pathological grading, and treatment response evaluation. However, the correlations between IVIM-DWI parameters and VEGF and MMP expression have not been reported. This study provides a preliminary analysis of the correlation between IVIM-DWI parameters and the expression of VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 to investigate the value of IVIM-DWI in the noninvasive evaluation of angiogenesis in HCC. IVIM-DWI was performed in 61 patients with HCC 1 week before they underwent surgical resection. VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression was detected using immunohistochemistry staining. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlations between the IVIM-DWI parameters and VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression in HCC. The fast apparent diffusion coefficient fraction (<i>f</i>) value was positively correlated with the expression of VEGF (P&lt;0.001), MMP-2 (P=0.002), and MMP-9 (P&lt;0.001). The fast apparent diffusion coefficient (<i>D</i>*) was positively correlated with VEGF (P&lt;0.001) and MMP-9 (P&lt;0.001) expression but was not correlated with MMP-2 (P=0.659) expression. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and slow apparent diffusion coefficient (<i>D</i>) values were not significantly correlated with the expression of VEGF (P=0.103 and P=0.543, respectively), MMP-2 (P=0.596 and P=0.338, respectively), or MMP-9 (P=0.102 and P=0.660, respectively).

The hypoxic TME is the crucial driver in the onset of insensitivity to chemotherapy. In this research, we elucidated the role played by bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in reducing cisplatin effects in TNBC. BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells, grown under hypoxic conditions in the presence of conditioned medium obtained from BM-MSCs (CM-MSCs), showed a strong cisplatin insensitivity and increased expression levels of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX). Therefore, we inhibited CM-MSC-induced CA IX by SLC-0111 to potentiate chemotherapy efficacy in TNBC cells. Our results showed that CM-MSCs under hypoxic conditions caused an increase in the ability of TNBC cells to form vascular structures, migrate and invade Matrigel. Cell treatment with cisplatin plus SLC-0111 was able to block these mechanisms, as well as the signaling pathways underlying them, such as p-AKT, p-ERK, CD44, MMP-2, vimentin, &#x3b2;-catenin, and N-cadherin, more effectively than treatment with single agents. In addition, a significant enhancement of apoptosis assessed by annexin V, caspase-3 expression and activity was also shown.

Identifying novel drivers of growth and metastasis hold therapeutic potential for the disease. Transport homeostasis between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi and the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) mediated by Golgi have been reported to be closely associated with tumor progression. However, to date, mechanistic studies remain limited. Here, we identified KDELR2 as a potential risk factor with prognostic value in patients with BCa, especially those harbouring the KDELR2 amplification. In addition, we found that KDELR2 is a regulator of BCa cell proliferation and tumorigenicity based on bioinformatic analysis with functional studies. Mechanistically, we revealed that KDELR2 could regulate the expression of KIF20A, thus stimulating the expression of MMP2, MMP9 and MKI67. Functionally, the overexpression of KDELR2 and KIF20A markedly promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and enhanced tumor growth in vivo, while knockdown of KDELR2 and KIF20A exerted the opposite effects. And the overexpression of KDELR2 also enhanced lymph node metastasis in vivo.

We analysed somatic mutations from 229 MPM samples, including previously published data and 58 samples that had undergone WGS within this study. This was combined with RNA-seq analysis to characterize the tumour immune environment. The comprehensive genome analysis identified 12 driver genes, including new candidate genes. Whole genome doubling was a frequent event that correlated with shorter survival. Mutational signature analysis revealed SBS5/40 were dominant in 93% of samples, and defects in homologous recombination repair were infrequent in our cohort. The tumour immune environment contained high M2 macrophage infiltrate linked with MMP2, MMP14, TGFB1 and CCL2 expression, representing an immune suppressive environment. The expression of TGFB1 was associated with overall survival. A small subset of samples (less than 10%) had a higher proportion of CD8 T cells and a high cytolytic score, suggesting a 'hot' immune environment independent of the somatic mutations.

Despite decades of research, the prevention and suppression of metastasis remain an elusive goal, and to date, only a few metastasis-related genes have been targeted therapeutically. Thus, there is a strong need to find potential genes involved in key driver traits of metastasis and their available drugs. In this study, we identified genes associated with metastasis and repurposable drugs that potentially target them. First, we use text mining of PubMed citations to identify candidate genes associated with metastatic processes, such as invadopodia, motility, movement, metastasis, invasion, wound healing, EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition), and podosome. Next, we annotated the top genes involved in each process as a driver, tumor suppressor, or oncogene. Then, a total of 185 unique cancer genes involved in metastasis-related processes were used for hub gene analysis using bioinformatics tools. Notably, a total of 77 hub genes were identified. Further, we used virtual screening data of druggable candidate hub genes involved in metastasis and identified potential drugs that can be repurposed as anti-metastatic drugs. Remarkably, we found a total of 50 approved drugs that have the potential to be repurposed against 19 hub genes involved in metastasis-related processes. These 50 drugs were also found to be validated in different cancer cell lines, such as <i>dasatinib</i>, <i>captopril</i>, <i>leflunomide</i>, and <i>dextromethorphan</i> targeting SRC, MMP2, PTK2B, and RAC1 hub genes, respectively.

Through cell communication analysis, we obtained the key cytokines of hepatic stellate cells regulating myofibroblasts, such as PDGFA, PDGFAR, PGF, NTF3, etc. At the same time, we also obtained key driver genes related to myofibroblast characteristics, such as LUM,GGT5, RBP1, ASPN,DCN, etc., through single-nucleus consensus weighted gene co-expression network analysis (scWGCNA). In addition, since APOE also plays a very important role in myofibroblasts, we also explored the driver genes associated with APOE, such as THY1,MMP2,COL3A1, etc. We analyzed the core driver gene of hepatic stellate cell transformation into myofibroblasts at the single-cell level in the process of liver fibrosis, providing valuable information for the future targeted gene diagnosis and treatment of liver fibrosis.",2022,"Cell communication; Hepatic stellate cells; Liver fibrosis; Myofibroblast; scWGCNA; Apolipoproteins E; Cell Communication; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Regulatory Networks; Hepatic Stellate Cells; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Single-Cell Analysis",29

The dysregulation of the Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin pathway is the key factor regulating glioma malignancy. Wnt antagonist, secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP4), which has a prominent pro-apoptotic role in glioma stem cells, has two functional domains, the netrin-like domain (NLD), and cysteine-rich domain (CRD) both of which contribute to apoptotic properties of the whole protein. However, there are no reports elucidating the specific effects of individual domains of sFRP4 in inhibiting the invasive properties of glioma. This study explores the efficacy of the domains of sFRP4 in inhibiting the key hallmarks of glioblastoma such as invasion, metastasis, and stemness. We overexpressed sFRP4 and its domains in the glioblastoma cell line, U87MG cells and observed that both CRD and NLD domains played prominent roles in attenuating cancer stem cell properties. Significantly, we could demonstrate for the first time that both NLD and CRD domains negatively impacted the key driver of metastasis and migration, the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Mechanistically, compared to CRD, NLD domain suppressed MMP-2 mediated invasion more effectively in glioma cells as observed in matrigel invasion assay and a function-blocking antibody assay. Fluorescent matrix degradation assay further revealed that NLD reduces matrix degradation. NLD also significantly disrupted fibronectin assembly and decreased cell adhesion in another glioma cell line LN229.

The most overexpressed survival signaling-related gene in spheroids was phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 3 (PIK3R3), a regulatory subunit of PI3K, which functions in tumorigenesis and metastasis. In a human sarcoma microarray, PIK3R3 was also overexpressed by 4.1-fold compared with normal tissues. PIK3R3 inhibition using shRNA in the HT1080, SK-LMS-1, and DDLS8817 dedifferentiated liposarcoma in spheroids and in CD133+ cells (a CSC marker) reduced expression of CD133 and the stem cell factor Nanog and blocked spheroid formation by 61-71%. Mechanistic studies showed that in spheroid cells, PIK3R3 activated AKT and ERK signaling. Inhibition of PIK3R3, AKT, or ERK using shRNA or inhibitors decreased expression of Nanog, spheroid formation by 68-73%, and anchorage-independent growth by 76-91%. PIK3R3 or ERK1/2 inhibition similarly blocked sarcoma spheroid cell migration, invasion, secretion of MMP-2, xenograft invasion into adjacent normal tissue, and chemotherapy resistance. Together, these results show that signaling through the PIK3R3/ERK/Nanog axis promotes sarcoma CSC phenotypes such as migration, invasion, and chemotherapy resistance, and identify PIK3R3 as a potential therapeutic target in sarcoma.",2022,"AC133 Antigen; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Nanog Homeobox Protein; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Protein Domains; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Sarcoma; Spheroids, Cellular; Up-Regulation; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",29

However, the impact of hematopoietic JAK2V617F on the aortic aneurysms (AAs) remains unknown. Our cross-sectional study indicated that 9 (23%) out of 39 MPN patients with JAK2V617F exhibited the presence of AAs. Next, to clarify whether the hematopoietic JAK2V617F contributes to the AAs, we applied a bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with the donor cells from Jak2V617F transgenic (JAK2V617F) mice or control wild-type (WT) mice into lethally irradiated apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. Five weeks after BMT, the JAK2V617F-BMT mice and WT-BMT mice were subjected to continuous angiotensin II infusion to induce AA formation. Four weeks after angiotensin II infusion, the abdominal aorta diameter in JAK2V617F-BMT mice was significantly enlarged compared to that in the WT-BMT mice. Additionally, the abdominal AA-free survival rate was significantly lower in the JAK2V617F-BMT mice. Hematopoietic JAK2V617F accelerated aortic elastic lamina degradation as well as activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 in the abdominal aorta. The numbers of infiltrated macrophages were significantly upregulated in the abdominal aorta of the JAK2V617F-BMT mice accompanied by STAT3 phosphorylation. The accumulation of BM-derived hematopoietic cells carrying JAK2V617F in the abdominal aorta was confirmed by use of reporter GFP-transgene. BM-derived macrophages carrying JAK2V617F showed increases in mRNA expression levels of Mmp2, Mmp9, and Mmp13. Ruxolitinib decreased the abdominal aorta diameter and the incidence of abdominal AA in the JAK2V617F-BMT mice.

Recently, we characterized a triterpene-squalene derived from marine brown alga. Herein, we investigated the potential of squalene in targeting HIF-signaling and other drivers of RCC progression. Squalene inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell dealth and reverted the cells' metastatic state (migration, clonal expansion) independent of their VHL status. Near-identical inhibition of HIF-1&#x3b1; and HIF-2&#x3b1; and the regulation of downstream targets in VHL wild type and mutant cell lines demonstrated squalene efficacy beyond VHL-HIF interaction. In a rat model of chemically induced RCC, squalene displayed chemopreventive capabilities by substantial reversal of lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial redox regulation, maintaining &#x2206;&#x3c8;<sub>m</sub>, inflammation [Akt, nuclear factor &#x3ba;B (NF-&#x3ba;B)], angiogenesis (VEGF&#x3b1;), metastasis [matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2)], and survival (Bax/Bcl2, cytochrome-c, Casp3). Squalene restored glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione-s-transferase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase and stabilized alkaline phosphatase, alkaline transaminase, and aspartate transaminase. The correlation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance with VEGF/NF-&#x3ba;B and negative association of GSH with Casp3 show that squalene employs reduction in ROS regulation. Cytokinesis-block micronuclei (CBMN) assay in VHL<sup>wt/mut</sup> cells revealed both direct and bystander effects of squalene with increased micronucleus (MN) frequency. Clastogenicity analysis of rat bone marrow cells demonstrated an anti-clastogenic effect of squalene, with increased polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs), decreased MNPCE,s and MN normochromatic erythrocytes. Squalene could effectively target HIF signaling that orchestrate RCC evolution. The efficacy of squalene is similar in VHL<sup>wt</sup> and VHL<sup>mut</sup> RCC cells, and hence, squalene could serve as a promising drug candidate for an RCC cure beyond VHL status and VHL-HIF interaction dependency. Summary: Squalene derived from marine brown algae displays strong anti-cancer (RCC) activity, functionally targeting HIF-signaling pathway, and affects various cellular process. The significance of squalene effect for RCC is highlighted by its efficiency beyond VHL status, designating itself a promising drug candidate.

Therefore, an in-depth study of the roles of lncRNA in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) carcinogenesis might be helpful to provide novel therapeutic targets. Here we report that lncRNA TINCR was significantly upregulated in NPC and was associated positively with poor survival. Silencing TINCR inhibited NPC progression and cisplatin resistance. Mechanistically, TINCR bound ACLY and protected it from ubiquitin degradation to maintain total cellular acetyl-CoA levels. Accumulation of cellular acetyl-CoA promoted <i>de novo</i> lipid biosynthesis and histone H3K27 acetylation, which ultimately regulated the peptidyl arginine deiminase 1 (PADI1)-MAPK-MMP2/9 pathway. In addition, insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 interacted with TINCR and slowed its decay, which partially accounted for TINCR upregulation in NPC. These findings demonstrate that TINCR acts as a crucial driver of NPC progression and chemoresistance and highlights the newly identified TINCR-ACLY-PADI1-MAPK-MMP2/9 axis as a potential therapeutic target in NPC. SIGNIFICANCE: TINCR-mediated regulation of a PADI1-MAPK-MMP2/9 signaling pathway plays a critical role in NPC progression and chemoresistance, marking TINCR as a viable therapeutic target in this disease.",2021,"ATP Citrate (pro-S)-Lyase; Acetyl Coenzyme A; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cisplatin; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma; Prognosis; Protein-Arginine Deiminase Type 1; RNA Stability; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA-Binding Proteins; Ubiquitination; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",29

The rapid invasion and dissemination of tumor cells into the surrounding normal brain is a major driver of tumor recurrence, and long-term survival of GBM patients is extremely rare. Actin-rich cell membrane protrusions known as invadopodia can facilitate the highly invasive properties of GBM cells. Ion channels have been proposed to contribute to a pro-invasive phenotype in cancer cells and may also be involved in the invadopodia activity of GBM cells. GBM cell cytotoxicity screening of several ion channel drugs identified three drugs with potent cell killing efficacy: flunarizine dihydrochloride, econazole nitrate, and quinine hydrochloride dihydrate. These drugs demonstrated a reduction in GBM cell invadopodia activity and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) secretion. Importantly, the treatment of GBM cells with these drugs led to a significant reduction in radiation/temozolomide-induced invadopodia activity. The dual cytotoxic and anti-invasive efficacy of these agents merits further research into targeting ion channels to reduce GBM malignancy, with a potential for future clinical translation in combination with the standard therapy.",2020,drug repurposing; glioblastoma; glioma; invadopodia; invasion; ion channels,29

As the extracellular matrix comprises the bulk of the stroma, matrix degrading proteases may play an important role in pancreatic cancer. It has been suggested that matrix metalloproteases are key drivers of both tumor growth and metastasis during pancreatic cancer progression. Based upon this notion, changes in matrix metalloprotease expression levels are often considered surrogate markers for pancreatic cancer progression and/or treatment response. Indeed, reduced matrix metalloprotease levels upon treatment (either pharmacological or due to genetic ablation) are considered as proof of the anti-tumorigenic potential of the mediator under study. In the current review, we aim to establish whether matrix metalloproteases indeed drive pancreatic cancer progression and whether decreased matrix metalloprotease levels in experimental settings are therefore indicative of treatment response. After a systematic review of the studies focusing on matrix metalloproteases in pancreatic cancer, we conclude that the available literature is not as convincing as expected and that, although individual matrix metalloproteases may contribute to pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis, this does not support the generalized notion that matrix metalloproteases drive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma progression.",2020,MMP; MMP14; MMP2; MMP7; MMP9; PDAC; matrix metalloproteases; pancreatic cancer,29

Extracellular matrix (ECM) is considered essential for sustaining tumor growth and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been identified as drivers of many aspects of the tumor phenotype. Mounting evidence indicates that both &#x3b1;-enolase (ENO1) and Myc promoter-binding protein-1 (MBP-1) also played pivotal roles in tumorigenesis, although as antagonists. ENO1 is involved in cell growth, hypoxia tolerance and autoimmune activities besides its major role in the glycolysis pathway. On the contrary, MBP-1, an alternative product of ENO1, suppresses cell proliferation and the invasive ability of cancer cells. Since an important task in personalized medicine is to discriminate a different subtype of patients with different clinical outcomes including chances of recurrence and metastasis, we investigated the functional relationship between ENO1/MBP-1 expression and MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity levels in both tissues and sera of breast cancer patients. We focused on the clinical relevance of ENO1 and MMPs (MMP-2 and MMP-9) overexpression in breast cancer tissues: The association between the higher ENO1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression with a worse prognosis suggest that the elevated ENO1 and MMPs expression are promising biomarkers for breast cancer. A relationship seems to exist between MBP-1 expression and the decrease in the activity levels of MMP-9 in cancer tissues and MMP-2 in sera. Moreover, the sera of breast cancer patients grouped for MBP-1 expression differentially induced, in vitro, cell proliferation and migration. Our findings support the hypothesis of patient's stratification based on ENO1, MBP-1 and MMPs expression.

Intradural extramedullary spinal dissemination of intracranial SFT/HPC is extremely rare. There is a paucity of data available to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of intraspinal dissemination of intracranial SFT/HPC. Herein, we presented a case of intracranial SFT/HPC with intraspinal metastasis. The resected tumor specimens were enrolled in a clinical sequencing program, including whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing. By comparing genomic sequencing data of the intracranial tumors with intraspinal metastasis, we established the somatic mutational profiles of these tumors. Clonality analysis revealed a distinct subclonal structure in the intracranial tumor and its intraspinal metastasis, which might reflect the possibility of intratumoral clonal selection and evolution during the process of tumor dissemination. Through bioinformatics analysis and Sanger sequencing validation, a DSTYK mutation (Met296Ile) was identified as a candidate driver of intraspinal metastasis in this SFT/HPC case. Further, an intracranial tumor-derived SFT/HPC cell line, HPC3, was established to explore the mechanisms of the DSTYK mutation in promoting SFT/HPC metastasis. Based on the HPC3 cell model, we found that the DSTYK mutation promoted cell migration and invasion of HPC3 cells via activation of ERK1/2 signaling, which was inhibited by the MEK/ERK inhibitor AZD6244. The DSTYK mutation was also shown to upregulate the expression of two metastasis-related molecules: MMP2 and MMP9 in HPC3 cells; however, this effect was attenuated by AZD6244 treatment. Therefore, the DSTYK mutation may activate ERK1/2/MMP2/9 signaling to promote tumor cell metastasis in SFT/HPC. In conclusion, our study revealed the potential role of DSTYK mutation in the regulation of intraspinal metastasis of SFT/HPC, which might provide new biological insights into this rare disease.",2020,"Brain Neoplasms; Cauda Equina; Cell Line, Tumor; Frontal Lobe; Hemangiopericytoma; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Male; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Middle Aged; Mutation; Neoplasm Metastasis; Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms; Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Solitary Fibrous Tumors; Exome Sequencing",29
30903592,MMP2,10.1007/s11538-019-00597-x,A Mathematical Framework for Modelling the Metastatic Spread of Cancer.,"Cancer is a complex disease that starts with mutations of key genes in one cell or a small group of cells at a primary site in the body. If these cancer cells continue to grow successfully and, at some later stage, invade the surrounding tissue and acquire a vascular network, they can spread to distant secondary sites in the body. This process, known as metastatic spread, is responsible for around 90% of deaths from cancer and is one of the so-called hallmarks of cancer. To shed light on the metastatic process, we present a mathematical modelling framework that captures for the first time the interconnected processes of invasion and metastatic spread of individual cancer cells in a spatially explicit manner-a multigrid, hybrid, individual-based approach. This framework accounts for the spatiotemporal evolution of mesenchymal- and epithelial-like cancer cells, membrane-type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and the diffusible matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and for their interactions with the extracellular matrix. Using computational simulations, we demonstrate that our model captures all the key steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade, i.e. invasion by both heterogeneous cancer cell clusters and by single mesenchymal-like cancer cells; intravasation of these clusters and single cells both via active mechanisms mediated by matrix-degrading enzymes (MDEs) and via passive shedding; circulation of cancer cell clusters and single cancer cells in the vasculature with the associated risk of cell death and disaggregation of clusters; extravasation of clusters and single cells; and metastatic growth at distant secondary sites in the body. By faithfully reproducing experimental results, our simulations support the evidence-based hypothesis that the membrane-bound MT1-MMP is the main driver of invasive spread rather than diffusible MDEs such as MMP-2.",2021,"Individual-based model; Mathematical oncology; Metastatic spread; Multigrid framework; Tumour microenvironment; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Communication; Computer Simulation; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; Humans; Male; Mathematical Concepts; Matrix Metalloproteinase 14; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Models, Biological; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplastic Cells, Circulating; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Systems Biology",29

Because the role and mechanism of GATA4 in breast cancer (BrCa) remain poorly understood, we focused on the expression of GATA4 in BrCa cell lines and tissues and its mechanism in breast oncogenesis. Semiquantitative real-time&#xa0;polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect expression of GATA4 in BrCa cell lines and adjacent breast tissues. Methylation statuses of the GATA4 promoter were studied using methylation-specific PCR in BrCa cell lines.The effects of GATA4 on proliferation, invasion, and cell cycle were also analyzed. Compared with adjacent breast tissue, GATA4 expression in BrCa tissue and cell lines was obviously lower and low expression levels of GATA4 predicted poor outcome. Methylation of GATA4 occurred in almost all of BrCa cell lines . GATA4 overexpression decreased viability, invasion, migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of MB-231 and BT549 cells, and markedly induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Exogenous expression GATA4 accompanied a significant alteration of MMP2, MMP3, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin expression and induction of the caspase-8 pathway. Moreover, GATA4 could directly repress RelA (p65) transcription, reduce the nuclear phosphorylation-p65 and upregulate inhibitor kappa B expression. Altogether, GATA4 plays a tumor-suppressive role via repression of NF-&#x3ba;B signaling in BrCa cells.

In this process, sequential mutations of APC, KRAS, TP53, and SMAD4 enable oncogenic signaling and establish the hallmarks of cancer. Here, we use mass cytometry of isogenic human colon organoids and patient-derived cancer organoids to capture oncogenic signaling, cell phenotypes, and differentiation states in a high-dimensional single-cell map. We define a differentiation axis in all tumor progression states from normal to cancer. Our data show that colorectal cancer driver mutations shape the distribution of cells along the differentiation axis. In this regard, subsequent mutations can have stem cell promoting or restricting effects. Individual nodes of the cancer cell signaling network remain coupled to the differentiation state, regardless of the presence of driver mutations.

It is now clear, however, that plastics are also responsible for significant harms to human health, the economy, and the earth's environment. These harms occur at every stage of the plastic life cycle, from extraction of the coal, oil, and gas that are its main feedstocks through to ultimate disposal into the environment. The extent of these harms not been systematically assessed, their magnitude not fully quantified, and their economic costs not comprehensively counted. The goals of this Minderoo-Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health are to comprehensively examine plastics' impacts across their life cycle on: (1) human health and well-being; (2) the global environment, especially the ocean; (3) the economy; and (4) vulnerable populations-the poor, minorities, and the world's children. On the basis of this examination, the Commission offers science-based recommendations designed to support development of a Global Plastics Treaty, protect human health, and save lives. This Commission report contains seven Sections. Following an Introduction, Section 2 presents a narrative review of the processes involved in plastic production, use, and disposal and notes the hazards to human health and the environment associated with each of these stages. Section 3 describes plastics' impacts on the ocean and notes the potential for plastic in the ocean to enter the marine food web and result in human exposure. Section 4 details plastics' impacts on human health. Section 5 presents a first-order estimate of plastics' health-related economic costs. Section 6 examines the intersection between plastic, social inequity, and environmental injustice. Section 7 presents the Commission's findings and recommendations. Plastics are complex, highly heterogeneous, synthetic chemical materials. Over 98% of plastics are produced from fossil carbon- coal, oil and gas. Plastics are comprised of a carbon-based polymer backbone and thousands of additional chemicals that are incorporated into polymers to convey specific properties such as color, flexibility, stability, water repellence, flame retardation, and ultraviolet resistance. Many of these added chemicals are highly toxic. They include carcinogens, neurotoxicants and endocrine disruptors such as phthalates, bisphenols, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), brominated flame retardants, and organophosphate flame retardants. They are integral components of plastic and are responsible for many of plastics' harms to human health and the environment.Global plastic production has increased almost exponentially since World War II, and in this time more than 8,300 megatons (Mt) of plastic have been manufactured. Annual production volume has grown from under 2 Mt in 1950 to 460 Mt in 2019, a 230-fold increase, and is on track to triple by 2060. More than half of all plastic ever made has been produced since 2002. Single-use plastics account for 35-40% of current plastic production and represent the most rapidly growing segment of plastic manufacture.Explosive recent growth in plastics production reflects a deliberate pivot by the integrated multinational fossil-carbon corporations that produce coal, oil and gas and that also manufacture plastics. These corporations are reducing their production of fossil fuels and increasing plastics manufacture. The two principal factors responsible for this pivot are decreasing global demand for carbon-based fuels due to increases in 'green' energy, and massive expansion of oil and gas production due to fracking.Plastic manufacture is energy-intensive and contributes significantly to climate change. At present, plastic production is responsible for an estimated 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the contribution of Brazil. This fraction is projected to increase to 4.5% by 2060 if current trends continue unchecked. The plastic life cycle has three phases: production, use, and disposal. In production, carbon feedstocks-coal, gas, and oil-are transformed through energy-intensive, catalytic processes into a vast array of products. Plastic use occurs in every aspect of modern life and results in widespread human exposure to the chemicals contained in plastic. Single-use plastics constitute the largest portion of current use, followed by synthetic fibers and construction.Plastic disposal is highly inefficient, with recovery and recycling rates below 10% globally. The result is that an estimated 22 Mt of plastic waste enters the environment each year, much of it single-use plastic and are added to the more than 6 gigatons of plastic waste that have accumulated since 1950. Strategies for disposal of plastic waste include controlled and uncontrolled landfilling, open burning, thermal conversion, and export. Vast quantities of plastic waste are exported each year from high-income to low-income countries, where it accumulates in landfills, pollutes air and water, degrades vital ecosystems, befouls beaches and estuaries, and harms human health-environmental injustice on a global scale. Plastic-laden e-waste is particularly problematic. Plastics and plastic-associated chemicals are responsible for widespread pollution. They contaminate aquatic (marine and freshwater), terrestrial, and atmospheric environments globally. The ocean is the ultimate destination for much plastic, and plastics are found throughout the ocean, including coastal regions, the sea surface, the deep sea, and polar sea ice. Many plastics appear to resist breakdown in the ocean and could persist in the global environment for decades. Macro- and micro-plastic particles have been identified in hundreds of marine species in all major taxa, including species consumed by humans. Trophic transfer of microplastic particles and the chemicals within them has been demonstrated. Although microplastic particles themselves (&gt;10 &#xb5;m) appear not to undergo biomagnification, hydrophobic plastic-associated chemicals bioaccumulate in marine animals and biomagnify in marine food webs. The amounts and fates of smaller microplastic and nanoplastic particles (MNPs &lt;10 &#xb5;m) in aquatic environments are poorly understood, but the potential for harm is worrying given their mobility in biological systems. Adverse environmental impacts of plastic pollution occur at multiple levels from molecular and biochemical to population and ecosystem. MNP contamination of seafood results in direct, though not well quantified, human exposure to plastics and plastic-associated chemicals. Marine plastic pollution endangers the ocean ecosystems upon which all humanity depends for food, oxygen, livelihood, and well-being. Coal miners, oil workers and gas field workers who extract fossil carbon feedstocks for plastic production suffer increased mortality from traumatic injury, coal workers' pneumoconiosis, silicosis, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Plastic production workers are at increased risk of leukemia, lymphoma, hepatic angiosarcoma, brain cancer, breast cancer, mesothelioma, neurotoxic injury, and decreased fertility. Workers producing plastic textiles die of bladder cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma, and interstitial lung disease at increased rates. Plastic recycling workers have increased rates of cardiovascular disease, toxic metal poisoning, neuropathy, and lung cancer. Residents of ""fenceline"" communities adjacent to plastic production and waste disposal sites experience increased risks of premature birth, low birth weight, asthma, childhood leukemia, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer.During use and also in disposal, plastics release toxic chemicals including additives and residual monomers into the environment and into people. National biomonitoring surveys in the USA document population-wide exposures to these chemicals. Plastic additives disrupt endocrine function and increase risk for premature births, neurodevelopmental disorders, male reproductive birth defects, infertility, obesity, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and cancers. Chemical-laden MNPs formed through the environmental degradation of plastic waste can enter living organisms, including humans. Emerging, albeit still incomplete evidence indicates that MNPs may cause toxicity due to their physical and toxicological effects as well as by acting as vectors that transport toxic chemicals and bacterial pathogens into tissues and cells.Infants in the womb and young children are two populations at particularly high risk of plastic-related health effects. Because of the exquisite sensitivity of early development to hazardous chemicals and children's unique patterns of exposure, plastic-associated exposures are linked to increased risks of prematurity, stillbirth, low birth weight, birth defects of the reproductive organs, neurodevelopmental impairment, impaired lung growth, and childhood cancer. Early-life exposures to plastic-associated chemicals also increase the risk of multiple non-communicable diseases later in life. Plastic's harms to human health result in significant economic costs. We estimate that in 2015 the health-related costs of plastic production exceeded $250 billion (2015 Int$) globally, and that in the USA alone the health costs of disease and disability caused by the plastic-associated chemicals PBDE, BPA and DEHP exceeded $920 billion (2015 Int$). Plastic production results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions equivalent to 1.96 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>e) annually. Using the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) social cost of carbon metric, we estimate the annual costs of these GHG emissions to be $341 billion (2015 Int$).These costs, large as they are, almost certainly underestimate the full economic losses resulting from plastics' negative impacts on human health and the global environment. All of plastics' economic costs-and also its social costs-are externalized by the petrochemical and plastic manufacturing industry and are borne by citizens, taxpayers, and governments in countries around the world without compensation. The adverse effects of plastics and plastic pollution on human health, the economy and the environment are not evenly distributed. They disproportionately affect poor, disempowered, and marginalized populations such as workers, racial and ethnic minorities, ""fenceline"" communities, Indigenous groups, women, and children, all of whom had little to do with creating the current plastics crisis and lack the political influence or the resources to address it. Plastics' harmful impacts across its life cycle are most keenly felt in the Global South, in small island states, and in disenfranchised areas in the Global North. Social and environmental justice (SEJ) principles require reversal of these inequitable burdens to ensure that no group bears a disproportionate share of plastics' negative impacts and that those who benefit economically from plastic bear their fair share of its currently externalized costs. It is now clear that current patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal are not sustainable and are responsible for significant harms to human health, the environment, and the economy as well as for deep societal injustices.The main driver of these worsening harms is an almost exponential and still accelerating increase in global plastic production. Plastics' harms are further magnified by low rates of recovery and recycling and by the long persistence of plastic waste in the environment.The thousands of chemicals in plastics-monomers, additives, processing agents, and non-intentionally added substances-include amongst their number known human carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, neurotoxicants, and persistent organic pollutants. These chemicals are responsible for many of plastics' known harms to human and planetary health. The chemicals leach out of plastics, enter the environment, cause pollution, and result in human exposure and disease. All efforts to reduce plastics' hazards must address the hazards of plastic-associated chemicals. To protect human and planetary health, especially the health of vulnerable and at-risk populations, and put the world on track to end plastic pollution by 2040, this Commission supports urgent adoption by the world's nations of a strong and comprehensive Global Plastics Treaty in accord with the mandate set forth in the March 2022 resolution of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA).International measures such as a Global Plastics Treaty are needed to curb plastic production and pollution, because the harms to human health and the environment caused by plastics, plastic-associated chemicals and plastic waste transcend national boundaries, are planetary in their scale, and have disproportionate impacts on the health and well-being of people in the world's poorest nations. Effective implementation of the Global Plastics Treaty will require that international action be coordinated and complemented by interventions at the national, regional, and local levels.This Commission urges that a cap on global plastic production with targets, timetables, and national contributions be a central provision of the Global Plastics Treaty. We recommend inclusion of the following additional provisions:The Treaty needs to extend beyond microplastics and marine litter to include all of the many thousands of chemicals incorporated into plastics.The Treaty needs to include a provision banning or severely restricting manufacture and use of unnecessary, avoidable, and problematic plastic items, especially single-use items such as manufactured plastic microbeads.The Treaty needs to include requirements on extended producer responsibility (EPR) that make fossil carbon producers, plastic producers, and the manufacturers of plastic products legally and financially responsible for the safety and end-of-life management of all the materials they produce and sell.The Treaty needs to mandate reductions in the chemical complexity of plastic products; health-protective standards for plastics and plastic additives; a requirement for use of sustainable non-toxic materials; full disclosure of all components; and traceability of components. International cooperation will be essential to implementing and enforcing these standards.The Treaty needs to include SEJ remedies at each stage of the plastic life cycle designed to fill gaps in community knowledge and advance both distributional and procedural equity.This Commission encourages inclusion in the Global Plastic Treaty of a provision calling for exploration of listing at least some plastic polymers as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) under the Stockholm Convention.This Commission encourages a strong interface between the Global Plastics Treaty and the Basel and London Conventions to enhance management of hazardous plastic waste and slow current massive exports of plastic waste into the world's least-developed countries.This Commission recommends the creation of a Permanent Science Policy Advisory Body to guide the Treaty's implementation. The main priorities of this Body would be to guide Member States and other stakeholders in evaluating which solutions are most effective in reducing plastic consumption, enhancing plastic waste recovery and recycling, and curbing the generation of plastic waste. This Body could also assess trade-offs among these solutions and evaluate safer alternatives to current plastics. It could monitor the transnational export of plastic waste. It could coordinate robust oceanic-, land-, and air-based MNP monitoring programs.This Commission recommends urgent investment by national governments in research into solutions to the global plastic crisis. This research will need to determine which solutions are most effective and cost-effective in the context of particular countries and assess the risks and benefits of proposed solutions. Oceanographic and environmental research is needed to better measure concentrations and impacts of plastics &lt;10 &#xb5;m and understand their distribution and fate in the global environment. Biomedical research is needed to elucidate the human health impacts of plastics, especially MNPs. This Commission finds that plastics are both a boon to humanity and a stealth threat to human and planetary health. Plastics convey enormous benefits, but current linear patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal that pay little attention to sustainable design or safe materials and a near absence of recovery, reuse, and recycling are responsible for grave harms to health, widespread environmental damage, great economic costs, and deep societal injustices. These harms are rapidly worsening.While there remain gaps in knowledge about plastics' harms and uncertainties about their full magnitude, the evidence available today demonstrates unequivocally that these impacts are great and that they will increase in severity in the absence of urgent and effective intervention at global scale. Manufacture and use of essential plastics may continue. However, reckless increases in plastic production, and especially increases in the manufacture of an ever-increasing array of unnecessary single-use plastic products, need to be curbed.Global intervention against the plastic crisis is needed now because the costs of failure to act will be immense.",2023,"environmental health; human health; microplastics; ocean health; plastic additives; plastic life cycle; United States; Child; Animals; Humans; Male; Female; Child, Preschool; Plastics; Ecosystem; Monaco; Microplastics; Persistent Organic Pollutants; Greenhouse Gases; Cardiovascular Diseases; Endocrine Disruptors; Flame Retardants; Lung Neoplasms; Coal; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive",6

We sought to define transcriptional states of colorectal cancer cells and signals controlling their development by performing single-cell transcriptome analysis of tumors and matched non-cancerous tissues of twelve colorectal cancer patients. We defined patient-overarching colorectal cancer cell clusters characterized by differential activities of oncogenic signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and oncogenic traits such as replication stress. RNA metabolic labeling and assessment of RNA velocity in patient-derived organoids revealed developmental trajectories of colorectal cancer cells organized along a mitogen-activated protein kinase activity gradient. This was in contrast to normal colon organoid cells developing along graded Wnt activity. Experimental targeting of EGFR-BRAF-MEK in cancer organoids affected signaling and gene expression contingent on predictive KRAS/BRAF mutations and induced cell plasticity overriding default developmental trajectories.

In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of paired circulating CLL (PB-CLL) and RS biopsies (tissue-RS) from 17 patients recruited into a clinical trial (CHOP-O). We found that tissue-RS was enriched for mutations in poor-risk CLL drivers and genes in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. In addition, we identified genomic aberrations not previously implicated in RS, including the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor (PTPRD) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3). In the noncoding genome, we discovered activation-induced cytidine deaminase-related and unrelated kataegis in tissue-RS affecting regulatory regions of key immune-regulatory genes. These include BTG2, CXCR4, NFATC1, PAX5, NOTCH-1, SLC44A5, FCRL3, SELL, TNIP2, and TRIM13. Furthermore, differences between the global mutation signatures of pairs of PB-CLL and tissue-RS samples implicate DDR as the dominant mechanism driving transformation. Pathway-based clonal deconvolution analysis showed that genes in the MAPK and DDR pathways demonstrate high clonal-expansion probability. Direct comparison of nodal-CLL and tissue-RS pairs from an independent cohort confirmed differential expression of the same pathways by RNA expression profiling. Our integrated analysis of WGS and RNA expression data significantly extends previous targeted approaches, which were limited by the lack of germline samples, and it facilitates the identification of novel genomic correlates implicated in RS transformation, which could be targeted therapeutically.

Use of HT more than 5 years is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease; breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers; thromboembolic stroke; gallbladder disease; dementia; and incontinence. To explore older women's perceptions of the benefits and risks of long-term HT and examine factors influencing their decisions to use HT &gt; 5 years despite medical risks. A qualitative approach was selected to broadly explore thought processes and social phenomena underlying long-term users' decisions not to discontinue HT. Interviews were conducted with 30 women over age 60 reporting use of systemic HT more than 5 years recruited from an urban area in California and a small city in the Rocky Mountain region. Transcripts of interviews were analyzed using conventional grounded theory methods. Women reported using HT to preserve youthful physical and mental function and prevent disease. Gynecologists had reassured participants regarding risk, about which all 30 expressed little concern. Participants, rather than providers, were the principal drivers of long-term use. Participants perceived estrogen to have anti-aging efficacy, and using HT imparted a sense of control over various aspects of aging. Maintaining this sense of control was prioritized over potential risk from prolonged use. Our findings provide an additional perspective on previous work suggesting the pharmaceutical industry has leveraged older women's self-esteem, vanity, and fear of aging to sell hormones through marketing practices designed to shape the beliefs of both clinicians and patients. Efforts are needed to: 1) address misconceptions among patients and providers about medically supported uses and risks of prolonged HT, and 2) examine commercial influences, such as medical ghostwriting, that may lead to distorted views of HT efficacy and risk.",2020,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Cardiovascular Diseases; Culture; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Postmenopause",6

Using seizure and social parameters, we followed patients who had temporal lobe surgery (TLS) in childhood to determine long-term outcomes. We identified 42 patients who underwent TLS for medically intractable epilepsy during childhood. Follow-up data were collected from 10 to 20 years after surgery (median, 12 years). We studied histopathology, seizure outcome, employment, school enrolment, and driver's licensing. Patients or parents graded their satisfaction with TLS.

We analyzed the expression profile of colorectal cancer (CRC), combined the driver gene and drug target databases, and identified protein kinase kalirin RhoGEF kinase (kalirin/KALRN) which is related to CRC metastasis. Based on the structure of kalirin, we screened for the small molecular compound ZINC65387069. We first compared the kinase inhibitory activities and molecular properties of ZINC65387069 and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We then determined the effects of ZINC65387069 on the phosphorylation of protein kinase B-Raf. Finally, we determined the effects of ZINC65387069 on migration and apoptosis of HCT116 cells as well as RKO cells. The cell cytoskeleton was also determined. Compared with traditional TKIs, ZINC65387069 had stronger kinase inhibitory activity, a simpler structure, higher water solubility, a smaller polar surface area, and lower molecular weight and volume. In CRC cells, ZINC65387069 could significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of B-Raf as well as inhibit cell migration, destroy the cell cytoskeleton, and promote cell apoptosis.

Here, we systematically examined mutations from recently published melanoma NGS data involving 241 paired tumor-normal samples to identify potentially clinically relevant mutations. Melanomas were characterized according to an in-house clinical assay that identifies well-known specific recurrent mutations in five driver genes: BRAF (affecting V600), NRAS (G12, G13, and Q61), KIT (W557, V559, L576, K642, and D816), GNAQ (Q209), and GNA11 (Q209). Tumors with none of these mutations are termed ""pan negative."" We then mined the driver mutation-positive and pan-negative melanoma NGS data for mutations in 632 cancer genes that could influence existing or emerging targeted therapies. First, we uncovered several genes whose mutations were more likely associated with BRAF- or NRAS-driven melanomas, including TP53 and COL1A1 with BRAF, and PPP6C, KALRN, PIK3R4, TRPM6, GUCY2C, and PRKAA2 with NRAS. Second, we found that the 69 ""pan-negative"" melanoma genomes harbored alternate infrequent mutations in the five known driver genes along with many mutations in genes encoding guanine nucleotide binding protein &#x3b1;-subunits. Third, we identified 12 significantly mutated genes in ""pan-negative"" samples (ALK, STK31, DGKI, RAC1, EPHA4, ADAMTS18, EPHA7, ERBB4, TAF1L, NF1, SYK, and KDR), including five genes (RAC1, ADAMTS18, EPHA7, TAF1L, and NF1) with a recurrent mutation in at least two ""pan-negative"" tumor samples.

Even though several genomic studies have been conducted for NPC, their sample sizes are relatively small and systematic comparison with other cancer types has not been explored. In this study, we collected four-hundred-thirty-one samples from six previous studies and provided the first integrative analysis of NPC genomes. Combining several statistical methods for detecting driver genes, we identified 25 novel drivers for NPC, including <i>ATG14</i> and NLRC5. Many of these novel drivers are enriched in several important pathways, such as autophagy and immunity. By comparing NPC with many other cancer types, we found NPC is a unique cancer type in which a high proportion of patients (45.2%) do not have any known driver mutations (termed as ""missing driver events"") but have a preponderance of deletion events, including chromosome 3p deletion. Through signature analysis, we identified many known and novel signatures, including single-base signatures (<i>n</i> = 12), double-base signatures (<i>n</i> = 1), indel signatures (<i>n</i> = 9) and copy number signatures (<i>n</i> = 8). Many of these new signatures are involved in DNA repair and have unknown etiology and genome instability, implying an unprecedented dynamic mutational process possibly driven by complex interactions between viral and host genomes. By combining clinical, molecular and intra-tumor heterogeneity features, we constructed the first integrative survival model for NPC, providing a strong basis for patient prognosis and stratification. Taken together, we have performed one of the first integrative analyses of NPC genomes and brought unique genomic insights into tumorigenesis of a viral-driven cancer.",2023,NPC; copy number variations; driver genes; genome instability; integrative analysis; mutational signatures,3
33428330,NLRC5,10.1002/cjp2.198,Adult-type granulosa cell tumor of the ovary: a FOXL2-centric disease.,"Adult-type granulosa cell tumors (aGCTs) account for 90% of malignant ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors and 2-5% of all ovarian cancers. These tumors are usually diagnosed at an early stage and are treated with surgery. However, one-third of patients relapse between 4 and 8&#x2009;years after initial diagnosis, and there are currently no effective treatments other than surgery for these relapsed patients. As the majority of aGCTs (&gt;95%) harbor a somatic mutation in FOXL2 (c.C402G; p.C134W), the aim of this study was to identify genetic mutations besides FOXL2 C402G in aGCTs that could explain the clinical diversity of this disease. Whole-genome sequencing of 10 aGCTs and their matched normal blood was performed to identify somatic mutations. From this analysis, a custom amplicon-based panel was designed to sequence 39 genes of interest in a validation cohort of 83 aGCTs collected internationally. KMT2D inactivating mutations were present in 10 of 93 aGCTs (10.8%), and the frequency of these mutations was similar between primary and recurrent aGCTs. Inactivating mutations, including a splice site mutation in candidate tumor suppressor WNK2 and nonsense mutations in PIK3R1 and NLRC5, were identified at a low frequency in our cohort. Missense mutations were identified in cell cycle-related genes TP53, CDKN2D, and CDK1. From these data, we conclude that aGCTs are comparatively a homogeneous group of tumors that arise from a limited set of genetic events and are characterized by the FOXL2 C402G mutation. Secondary mutations occur in a subset of patients but do not explain the diverse clinical behavior of this disease. As the FOXL2 C402G mutation remains the main driver of this disease, progress in the development of therapeutics for aGCT would likely come from understanding the functional consequences of the FOXL2 C402G mutation.",2022,"FOXL2; KMT2D; TERT promoter; adult-type granulosa cell tumor of the ovary; cell cycle genes; mutation profiling; ovarian cancer; sex cord-stromal tumor; targeted sequencing; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Boston; British Columbia; CDC2 Protein Kinase; Class Ia Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p19; DNA Mutational Analysis; DNA-Binding Proteins; Europe; Female; Forkhead Box Protein L2; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Granulosa Cell Tumor; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Middle Aged; Mutation; Neoplasm Proteins; Ovarian Neoplasms; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Whole Genome Sequencing",3

We developed a LSD1/HDAC6 multitargeting inhibitor (iDual), a hydroxamic acid analogue of the clinical candidate LSD1 inhibitor GSK2879552. iDual inhibits both targets with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 540, 110, and 290 nM, respectively, against LSD1, HDAC6, and HDAC8. We compared its activity to structurally similar control probes that act by HDAC or LSD1 inhibition alone, as well as an inactive null compound. iDual inhibited the growth of leukemia cell lines at a higher level than GSK2879552 with micromolar IC<sub>50</sub> values. Dual engagement with LSD1 and HDAC6 was supported by dose dependent increases in substrate levels, biomarkers, and cellular thermal shift assay. Both histone methylation and acetylation of tubulin were increased, while acetylated histone levels were only mildly affected, indicating selectivity for HDAC6. Downstream gene expression (CD11b, CD86, p21) was also elevated in response to iDual treatment. Remarkably, iDual synergized with doxorubicin, triggering significant levels of apoptosis with a sublethal concentration of the drug.

However, the mechanisms underlying this organ-specific pattern remains to be elucidated. We sought to evaluate the utility of blocking extravasation to prevent lung metastasis. To identify potential geminin overexpression-controlled genetic drivers that promote TNBC tumor homing to lungs, we used the differential/suppression subtractive chain (D/SSC) technique. A geminin overexpression-induced lung metastasis gene signature consists of 24 genes was discovered. We validated overexpression of five of these genes (LGR5, HAS2, CDH11, NCAM2, and DSC2) in worsening lung metastasis-free survival in TNBC patients. Our data demonstrate that LGR5-induced &#x3b2;-catenin signaling and stemness in TNBC cells are geminin-overexpression dependent. They also demonstrate for the first-time expression of RSPO2 in mouse lung tissue only and exacerbation of its secretion in the circulation of mice that develop geminin overexpressing/LGR5<sup>+</sup>-TNBC lung metastasis. We identified a novel extravasation receptor complex, consists of CDH11, CD44v6, c-Met, and AXL on geminin overexpressing/LGR5<sup>+</sup>-TNBC lung metastatic precursors, inhibition of any of its receptors prevented geminin overexpressing/LGR5<sup>+</sup>-TNBC lung metastasis. Overall, we propose that geminin overexpression in normal mammary epithelial (HME) cells promotes the generation of TNBC metastatic precursors that home specifically to lungs by upregulating LGR5 expression and promoting stemness, intravasation, and extravasation in these precursors. Circulating levels of RSPO2 and OPN can be diagnostic biomarkers to improve risk stratification of metastatic TNBC to lungs, as well as identifying patients who may benefit from therapy targeting geminin alone or in combination with any member of the newly discovered extravasation receptor complex to minimize TNBC lung metastasis.",2022,"Animals; Breast; Cell Line, Tumor; Desmocollins; Geminin; Humans; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms",3

Previous studies suggest most sporadic MMs are of monoclone in origin. <b>Objective:</b> To elucidate the clonal relationship between two sporadic meningiomas from the same patient by using the next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform. <b>Methods:</b> Two MMs, located frontally and parietally on the right side, were surgically removed from a 52-year-old male. Pathological examinations and whole exome sequencing were performed on tumor samples, followed by Sanger sequencing validation. <b>Results:</b> MMs were diagnosed as secretory and fibrous subtypes, respectively, on histology (WHO grade I) and tumor DNA exhibited distinctive somatic mutation patterns. Specifically, the secretory subtype carried more single nucleotide variant while the fibrous subtype had much higher copy number variation. Besides, the two tumors demonstrated different mutation profiles in predisposing genes and known driver mutations. For example, the secretory subtype had missense mutations in <i>TRAF7</i> and <i>KLF4</i>, while the fibrous subtype had frameshift deletion of <i>NF2</i> gene in addition to copy number loss of <i>NF2</i> and <i>SMARCB1</i>, genetic events that have already been associated with the development of meningiomas.

In order to more accurately identify subclones, define phylogenetic relationships, and probe genotype-phenotype relationships, we developed methods for targeted mutation detection in DNA and RNA isolated from thousands of single cells from five CLL samples. By clearly resolving phylogenic relationships, we uncovered mutated <i>LCP1</i> and <i>WNK1</i> as novel CLL drivers, supported by functional evidence demonstrating their impact on CLL pathways. Integrative analysis of somatic mutations with transcriptional states prompts the idea that convergent evolution generates phenotypically similar cells in distinct genetic branches, thus creating a cohesive expression profile in each CLL sample despite the presence of genetic heterogeneity. Our study highlights the potential for single-cell RNA-based targeted analysis to sensitively determine transcriptional and mutational profiles of individual cancer cells, leading to increased understanding of driving events in malignancy.",2018,"Adult; Biomarkers, Tumor; Case-Control Studies; Evolution, Molecular; Female; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Single-Cell Analysis; Transcription, Genetic",2

Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) has a known mutation signature and has proven capable of inducing changes to DNA sequence that drives normal pre-stasis human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) past a first tumor suppressor barrier (stasis) and toward immortality. We analyzed normal, pre-stasis HMEC, three independent BaP-derived post-stasis HMEC strains (184Aa, 184Be, 184Ce) and two of their immortal derivatives(184A1 and 184BE1) by whole exome sequencing. The independent post-stasis strains exhibited between 93 and 233 BaP-induced mutations in exons. Seventy percent of the mutations were C:G&gt;A:T transversions, consistent with the known mutation spectrum of BaP. Mutations predicted to impact protein function occurred in several known and putative cancer drivers including p16, PLCG1, MED12, TAF1 in 184Aa; PIK3CG, HSP90AB1, WHSC1L1, LCP1 in 184Be and FANCA, LPP in 184Ce. Biological processes that typically harbor cancer driver mutations such as cell cycle, regulation of cell death and proliferation, RNA processing, chromatin modification and DNA repair were found to have mutations predicted to impact function in each of the post-stasis strains. Spontaneously immortalized HMEC lines derived from two of the BaP-derived post-stasis strains shared greater than 95% of their BaP-induced mutations with their precursor cells. These immortal HMEC had 10 or fewer additional point mutations relative to their post-stasis precursors, but acquired chromosomal anomalies during immortalization that arose independent of BaP. The results of this study indicate that acute exposures of HMEC to high dose BaP recapitulate mutation patterns of human tumors and can induce mutations in a number of cancer driver genes.",2015,"Benzo[a]pyrene; Carcinogenesis; HMEC; p16; Benzo(a)pyrene; Carcinogens, Environmental; Cells, Cultured; Chromosome Aberrations; Epithelial Cells; Exome; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Neoplasm; Humans; Mammary Glands, Human; Mutation; Neoplasms; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Young Adult",2

Leveraging insights from a proteomic study and publicly available transcriptomic data, we evaluated the predictive capacity of a gene panel corresponding to proteins differentially abundant between treatment-sensitive and treatment-resistant cell lines, deciphering predictors of treatment resistance and potential resistance mechanisms to BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy in patient biopsy samples. From our analysis, a 13-gene signature panel, in both test and validation datasets, could identify treatment-resistant or progressed melanoma cases with an accuracy and sensitivity of over 70%. The dysregulation of HMOX1, ICAM, MMP2, and SPARC defined a BRAF/MEK treatment-resistant landscape, with resistant cases showing a &gt;2-fold risk of expression of these genes. Furthermore, we utilized a combination of functional enrichment- and gene expression-derived scores to model and identify pathways, such as HMOX1-mediated mitochondrial stress response, as potential key drivers of the emergence of a BRAF/MEK inhibitor-resistant state in melanoma cells. Overall, our results highlight the utility of these genes in predicting treatment outcomes and the underlying mechanisms that can be targeted to reduce the development of resistance to BRAF/MEK targeted therapy.",2023,"BRAF/MEK inhibitors; aggressiveness; biomarkers; melanoma; resistance; risk stratification; Humans; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; Proteomics; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Cell Line, Tumor; Melanoma; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases",18

Communications 5:5469). The C10 signature is encoded by seven genes (ADSS, ATP2A2, CTPS1, IMPDH2, PKM2, PTGES3, SGPL1) and DNA alterations in C10-encoding genes are associated with longer survival in a subset of NSCLC. To explore the C10 signature as an oncogenic driver and address potential mechanisms of action, C10 protein expression and protein-protein interactions were determined. In independent NSCLC cohorts, the coordinated expression of C10 proteins was significant and mutations in C10 genes were associated with better outcome. Affinity purification-mass spectrometry and in vivo proximity-based biotin identification defined a C10 interactome involving 667 proteins including candidate drug targets and clusters associated with glycolysis, calcium homeostasis, and nucleotide and sphingolipid metabolism. DNA alterations in genes encoding C10 interactome components were also found to be associated with better survival. These data support the notion that the coordinated upregulation of the C10 signature impinges metabolic processes that collectively function as an oncogenic driver in NSCLC.",2022,"LC-MS/MS; NSCLC; interactome; metabolism; proteomics; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; DNA; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Proteome; Proteomics",18

Due to the blood-brain barrier, the accessibility of its treatments still remains significantly challenging. Unfortunately, the recurrence rates of glioblastoma upon surgery are very high too. Hence, understanding the molecular drivers of disease progression is valuable. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular drivers responsible for glioblastoma progression and identify valid biomarkers. Three microarray expression profiles GSE90604, GSE50601, and GSE134470 containing healthy and glioblastoma-affected samples revealed overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The interrelational pathway enrichment analysis elucidated the halt of cell cycle checkpoints and activation of signaling pathways and led to the identification of 6 predominant hub genes. Validation of hub genes in comparison with The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets identified the potential biomarkers of glioblastoma. The study evaluated two significantly upregulated genes, <i>SPARC</i> (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) and <i>VIM</i> (vimentin) for glioblastoma. The genes <i>CACNA1E</i> (calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 e), <i>SH3GL2</i> (SH3 domain-containing <i>GRB2-</i>like 2, endophilin A1), and <i>DDN</i> (dendrin) were identified as under-expressed genes as compared to the normal and pan-cancer tissues along with prominent putative prognostic biomarker potentials. The genes <i>DDN</i> and <i>SH3GL2</i> were found to be upregulated in the proneural subtype, while <i>CACNA1E</i> in the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma exhibits good prognostic potential. The mutational analysis also revealed the benign, possibly, and probably damaging substitution mutations. The correlation between the DEG and survival in glioblastoma was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier plots, and <i>VIM</i> had a greater life expectancy of 60.25&#xa0;months.

The development of drug resistance is one of the major impediments in targeted therapy. Currently, gene expression data is used as the most predictive molecular profile in pan-cancer drug sensitivity and resistance studies. However, the common regulatory mechanisms that drive drug sensitivity/resistance across cancer types are as yet, not fully understood. We focused on GDSC data on NRAS-mutant pan-cancer cell lines, to pinpoint key signaling targets in direct or indirect associations with NRAS, in order to identify other druggable targets involved in drug resistance. Large-scale gene expression, comparative gene co-expression and protein-protein interaction network analyses were performed on selected drugs inducing drug sensitivity/resistance. We validated our data from cell lines with those obtained from primary tissues from TCGA. From our big data studies validated with independent datasets, protein-coding hub genes FN1, CD44, TIMP1, SNAI2, and SPARC were found significantly enriched in signal transduction, proteolysis, cell adhesion and proteoglycans pathways in cancer as well as the PI3K/Akt-signaling pathway. Further studies of the regulation of these hub/driver genes by lncRNAs revealed several lncRNAs as prominent regulators, with MALAT1 as a possible master regulator. Transcription factor EGR1 may control the transcription rate of MALAT1 transcript. Synergizing these studies, we zeroed in on a pan-cancer regulatory axis comprising EGR1-MALAT1-driver coding&#xa0;genes&#xa0;playing a role. These identified gene regulators are bound to provide new paradigms in pan-cancer targeted therapy, a foundation for precision medicine, through the targeting of these key driver genes in the improvement of multi-drug sensitivity&#xa0;or resistance.",2022,"Biomarkers; Drug Resistance, Multiple; GTP Phosphohydrolases; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Neoplasms; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; RNA, Long Noncoding; Signal Transduction",18

This suggests the need for improved markers for prognosis, better understanding of the molecular mechanism, and targets for therapy. The defective exocytosis pathway is proposed as bona fide drivers of carcinogenesis. This study aimed to identify the exocytosis pathway network and its contribution to CC. We screened exocytosis genes from the The Cancer Genome Atlas Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-CESC) dataset and performed differential expression and methylation, Kaplan-Meier survival, and pathway enrichment analysis. We constructed the protein-protein interaction networks (PPIN), predicted the possible metastatic genes, and identified FDA approved drugs to target the exocytosis network in CC. Integrated bioinformatics analysis identified 245 differentially methylated genes, including 153 hypermethylated and 92 hypomethylated genes. Further, 89 exocytosis pathway genes were differentially expressed, including 60 downregulated and 29 upregulated genes in CC. The overlapping analysis identified 39 genes as methylation regulated genes and showed an inverse correlation between methylation and expression. The HCMDB database identified nine of the identified genes (GRIK5, PTPN6, GAB2, ATP8B4, HTR2A, SPARC, CLEC3B, VWF, and S100A11) were linked with metastasis in CC. Moreover, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis identified that high expression of PTPN6 and low expression of CLEC3B were significantly linked with poor overall survival (OS) in patients with CC. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis identified differentially expressed genes that were mainly involved with proteoglycans in cancer, TGF-beta signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, MAPK signaling pathway, and others. The PPIN identified 89 nodes, 192 edges with VWF, MMP9, THBS1, IGF1, CLU, A2M, IGF2, SPARC, VAMP2, and FIGF as top 10 hub genes. The drug-gene interaction analysis identified 188 FDA approved drugs targeting 32 genes, including 5 drugs that are already in use for treating CC.

Because SPARC shows high binding affinity to albumin, we reasoned that pediatric sarcoma xenografts expressing SPARC would show enhanced uptake and accumulation of nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel, a potent anticancer drug formulation. We first evaluated the expression of SPARC in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma, finding variable SPARC gene expression that correlated well with SPARC protein measured by immunoblotting. We revealed that the activity of the fusion gene chimera EWSR1-FLI1, the genetic driver of Ewing sarcoma, leads to lower expression of the gene SPARC in these tumors, likely due to enriched acetylation marks of the histone H3 lysine 27 at regions including the SPARC promoter and potential enhancers. Then, we used SPARC-edited Ewing sarcoma cells (A673 line) to demonstrate that SPARC knocked down (KD) cells accumulated significantly less amount of nab-paclitaxel in vitro than SPARC wild type (WT) cells. In vivo, SPARC KD and SPARC WT subcutaneous xenografts in mice achieved similar maximum intratumoral concentrations of nab-paclitaxel, though drug clearance from SPARC WT tumors was significantly slower. We confirmed such SPARC-mediated long-term intratumoral accumulation of nab-paclitaxel in Ewing sarcoma PDX with high expression of SPARC, which accumulated significantly more nab-paclitaxel than SPARC-low PDX. SPARC-high PDX responded better to nab-paclitaxel than SPARC-low tumors, although these results should be taken cautiously, given that the PDXs were established from different patients that could have specific determinants predisposing response to paclitaxel. In addition, SPARC KD Ewing sarcoma xenografts responded better to soluble docetaxel and paclitaxel than to nab-paclitaxel, while SPARC WT ones showed similar response to soluble and albumin-carried drugs. Overall, our results show that pediatric sarcomas expressing SPARC accumulate nab-paclitaxel for longer periods of time, which could have clinical implications for chemotherapy efficacy.",2022,Albumin nanoparticles; EWSR1-FLI1; Ewing sarcoma; Nab-paclitaxel; Patient-derived xenograft (PDX); Pediatric solid tumors; Rhabdomyosarcoma; Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC); Albumins; Animals; Bone Neoplasms; Humans; Mice; Osteonectin; Osteosarcoma; Paclitaxel,18
34873470,SPARC,,CD11b<sup>+</sup>DIP2A<sup>+</sup>LAG3<sup>+</sup> cells facilitate immune dysfunction in colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, and tumor metastasis is the leading cause of death. Targeting immune inhibitory checkpoint inhibitory pathways has attracted great attention, since the therapeutic efficacy induced by the specific blocking antibodies has been demonstrated even in metastatic CRC patients. However, the clinical outcome is low in many cases, and thus more effective treatments are needed in the clinical settings. A SPARC family member follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) is known as a key driver of tumor metastasis in various types of cancer. However, the immunological roles of the FSTL1 in the CRC pathogenesis remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the refractory FSTL1<sup>+</sup> CRC using murine and human FSTL1-transduced CRC cells. Also, based on the results, we evaluated anti-tumor efficacy induced by agents targeting the identified molecules using murine CRC metastasis models, and validated the clinical relevancy of the basic findings using tumor tissues and peripheral blood obtained from CRC patients. FSTL1 transduction conferred EMT-like properties, such as low proliferative (dormant) and high invasive abilities, on tumor cells. When the transfectants were subcutaneously implanted in mice, CD11b<sup>+</sup>DIP2A<sup>+</sup>LAG3<sup>+</sup> cells were abundantly expanded locally and systemically in the mice. Simultaneously, apoptotic T cells increased and were lastly excluded from the tumor tissues, allowing tumor aggravation leading to resistance to anti-PD1/PDL1 treatment. Blocking FSTL1 and LAG3, however, significantly suppressed the apoptosis induction, and successfully induced anti-tumor immune responses in the CRC metastasis models. Both treatments synergized in providing better prognosis of the mice. FSTL1 was significantly upregulated in tumor tissues and peripheral blood of CRC patients, and the CD11b<sup>+</sup>DIP2A<sup>+</sup>LAG3<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly expanded in the PBMCs as compared to those of healthy donors. The expansion level was significantly correlated with decrease of potent Ki67<sup>+</sup>GZMB<sup>+</sup> CTLs. These results suggest that the FSTL1-induced CD11b<sup>+</sup>DIP2A<sup>+</sup>LAG3<sup>+</sup> cells are a key driver of immune dysfunction in CRC. Targeting the FSTL1-LAG3 axis may be a promising strategy for treating metastatic CRC, and anti-FSTL1/LAG3 combination regimen may be practically useful in the clinical settings.",2021,Colorectal cancer; DIP2A; FSTL1; LAG3; immune dysfunction; metastasis; tumor evasion,18

Similarly, large scale CRISPR functional genomics efforts have mapped genes required for cancer cell proliferation or survival in hundreds of cell lines. Despite this, for specific disease subtypes, such as metastatic prostate cancer, there are likely a number of undiscovered tumor specific driver genes that may represent potential drug targets. To identify such genetic dependencies, we performed genome-scale CRISPRi screens in metastatic prostate cancer models. We then created a pipeline in which we integrated pan-cancer functional genomics data with our metastatic prostate cancer functional and clinical genomics data to identify genes that can drive aggressive prostate cancer phenotypes. Our integrative analysis of these data reveals known prostate cancer specific driver genes, such as AR and HOXB13, as well as a number of top hits that are poorly characterized. In this study we highlight the strength of an integrated clinical and functional genomics pipeline and focus on two top hit genes, KIF4A and WDR62. We demonstrate that both KIF4A and WDR62 drive aggressive prostate cancer phenotypes in vitro and in vivo in multiple models, irrespective of AR-status, and are also associated with poor patient outcome.",2021,"Animals; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Movement; Cells, Cultured; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Heterografts; Humans; Kinesins; Male; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Staging; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Prostatic Neoplasms; Survival Rate",18

The characterization of overexpressed genes could constitute a strategy for identifying drivers of tumor progression as targets for novel therapies. Thus, we performed an integrated gene-expression analysis on RNAseq data of 85 MPM patients from TCGA dataset and reference samples from the GEO. The gene list was further refined by using published studies, a functional enrichment analysis, and the correlation between expression and patients' overall survival. Three molecular signatures defined by 15 genes were detected. Seven genes were involved in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization, with the others in control of the mitotic cell division or apoptosis inhibition. Using Western blot analyses, we found that ADAMTS1, PODXL, CIT, KIF23, MAD2L1, TNNT1, and TRAF2 were overexpressed in a limited number of cell lines. On the other hand, interestingly, CTHRC1, E-selectin, SPARC, UHRF1, PRSS23, BAG2, and MDK were abundantly expressed in over 50% of the six MPM cell lines analyzed. Thus, these proteins are candidates as drivers for sustaining the tumorigenic process.

Here we combine data from secretome and proteome analysis using mass spectrometry with microarray data from mesenchymal transformed breast cancer cells (MCF-7-EMT) to elucidate the drivers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell invasion. Suppression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) reduced invasion in 2D and 3D invasion assays and expression of transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein ig-h3 (TGFBI), Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and lysyl oxidase (LOX), while the adhesion of cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) in mesenchymal transformed breast cancer cells is increased. In contrast, an enhanced expression of CTGF leads to an increased 3D invasion, expression of fibronectin 1 (FN1), secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich (SPARC) and CD44 and a reduced cell ECM adhesion. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist Triptorelin reduces CTGF expression in a Ras homolog family member A (RhoA)-dependent manner.

The multistep process of liver carcinogenesis involves various genetic and phenotypic alterations. The molecular pathways and driver mutations involved are still under investigation. DNA micorarray technology was used to identify differentially expressed genes between human hepatocarcinoma and non-tumorous liver tissues to establish a unique specific gene-expression profile independent of the underlying liver disease. The validity of this global gene-expression profile was tested for its robustness against biopsies from other liver entities (cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic liver) by diagnosing HCC in blinded samples. Most of the consistently and strongly overexpressed genes were related to cell-cycle regulation and DNA replication [27 genes, e.g. cyclin B1, karyopherin alpha 2 (KPNA2), cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDC2)], G-protein depending signaling [e.g. Rac GTPase activating protein 1 (RACGAP1), Rab GTPase YPT1 homolog (RAB1), and ADP-ribosylation factor-like 2 (ARL2)] and extracellular matrix re-modelling or cytoskeleton structure [22 genes, e.g. serine proteinase inhibitor 1 kazal-type (SPINK1), osteopontin (OPN), secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), collagen type 1 alpha2 (COL1A2), integrin alpha6 (ITGA6), and metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12)]. Furthermore, significantly differentially expressed genes (e.g. calcium-binding proteins, G-proteins, oncofetal proteins) in relation to tumor differentiation were detected using gene-expression analysis.

However, till now, little is known about the drivers in HCC metastatic tropism, and also no effective way has been developed to block the process of tropistic metastasis. In this study, we established several monoclonal HCC cell lines from HCCLM3-RFP together with their xenograft models, and then analyzed their metastatic potentials and tropisms using in-vitro and in-vivo assays, and finally elucidated the driving forces of HCC tropistic metastases. Six monoclonal cell lines with different organ site-specific tropism were established successfully. SPARC, VCAM1 and ANGPTL4 were found positively correlated with the potentials of lung metastasis, while ITGA1 had a positive relation to lymph node metastasis of enterocoelia. By our powerful platforms, HCC metastatic tropisms in clinic could be easily mimicked and recapitulated for exploring the bilateral interactions between tumor and its microenvironment, elucidating the drivers of HCC metastatic tropisms, and testing anti-cancer effects of newly developed agent in pre-clinical stage.",2016,"Animals; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Clone Cells; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Profiling; Heterografts; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Neoplasm Metastasis",18
24875049,SPARC,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004338,Ras-mediated deregulation of the circadian clock in cancer.,"Circadian rhythms are essential to the temporal regulation of molecular processes in living systems and as such to life itself. Deregulation of these rhythms leads to failures in biological processes and eventually to the manifestation of pathological phenotypes including cancer. To address the questions as to what are the elicitors of a disrupted clock in cancer, we applied a systems biology approach to correlate experimental, bioinformatics and modelling data from several cell line models for colorectal and skin cancer. We found strong and weak circadian oscillators within the same type of cancer and identified a set of genes, which allows the discrimination between the two oscillator-types. Among those genes are IFNGR2, PITX2, RFWD2, PPAR&#x3b3;, LOXL2, Rab6 and SPARC, all involved in cancer-related pathways. Using a bioinformatics approach, we extended the core-clock network and present its interconnection to the discriminative set of genes. Interestingly, such gene signatures link the clock to oncogenic pathways like the RAS/MAPK pathway. To investigate the potential impact of the RAS/MAPK pathway - a major driver of colorectal carcinogenesis - on the circadian clock, we used a computational model which predicted that perturbation of BMAL1-mediated transcription can generate the circadian phenotypes similar to those observed in metastatic cell lines. Using an inducible RAS expression system, we show that overexpression of RAS disrupts the circadian clock and leads to an increase of the circadian period while RAS inhibition causes a shortening of period length, as predicted by our mathematical simulations. Together, our data demonstrate that perturbations induced by a single oncogene are sufficient to deregulate the mammalian circadian clock.",2014,"Cell Line, Tumor; Circadian Clocks; Colorectal Neoplasms; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Signal Transduction; Skin Neoplasms; ras Proteins",18
20592488,SPARC,10.4161/cbt.10.4.12612,The molecular pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes.,"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are frequently associated with clonally restricted cytogenetic abnormalities, but until recently, the molecular pathobiology underlying this diverse group of neoplastic bone marrow disorders has been largely obscure. During the last 10 years, many investigative groups have applied the formidable power of new molecular biology techniques to hunt for recurrent genetic alterations in MDS primary cells. Several genetic abnormalities, including mutations in RUNX1 (AML1), TET2, ASXL1 and TP53, have been discovered in a substantial fraction of MDS cases; genes rearranged or mutated less commonly in MDS include IER3, ATRX, RAS and FLT3. Furthermore, haploinsufficiency and expression changes in RPS14, miR-145 and miR-146a, CDC25c, PP2A and SPARC in the absence of point mutations have also been implicated in MDS pathobiology. A major challenge will be to determine which of these mutations are causative ""drivers"" either in the development or progression of MDS, which might be therapeutically important because they predict response to treatment, and which are merely ""passengers"" along for the ride that alter phenotype but have no effect on the natural history of the disease. While the altered cellular biology of MDS is also increasingly well-understood, many mysteries remain. Abnormalities in iron regulation, microenvironment interactions, regulation of apoptosis and oxidative damage/DNA repair may all play an important pathobiological role. By gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of these complex and heterogeneous diseases, we will hopefully improve our ability to treat our patients with MDS beyond the therapies with limited effectiveness that are available at present.",2011,"Anemia, Aplastic; Apoptosis; Bone Marrow Diseases; Bone Marrow Failure Disorders; Chromosome Aberrations; DNA Repair; Haploinsufficiency; Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal; Humans; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases; Oxidative Stress; Point Mutation; Protein Biosynthesis; Translocation, Genetic",18

Here we show that miR-155 increases CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell antitumor function by restraining T cell senescence and functional exhaustion through epigenetic silencing of drivers of terminal differentiation. miR-155 enhances Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) activity indirectly by promoting the expression of the PRC2-associated factor Phf19 through downregulation of the Akt inhibitor, Ship1. Phf19 orchestrates a transcriptional program extensively shared with miR-155 to restrain T cell senescence and sustain CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell antitumor responses. These effects rely on Phf19 histone-binding capacity, which is critical for the recruitment of PRC2 to the target chromatin. These findings establish the miR-155-Phf19-PRC2 as a pivotal axis regulating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation, thereby paving new ways for potentiating cancer immunotherapy through epigenetic reprogramming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell fate.",2019,"Adoptive Transfer; Animals; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cell Differentiation; Cellular Senescence; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Melanoma, Experimental; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; MicroRNAs; Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases; Polycomb Repressive Complex 2; Skin Neoplasms; Transcription Factors",1

Despite cachexia sharing pathophysiological features with a number of neuromuscular wasting conditions, including age-related sarcopenia, the mechanisms underlying cachexia remain poorly understood. Studies of related conditions suggest that pathological targeting of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) may play a key role in cachexia, but this has yet to be investigated in human patients. Here, high-resolution morphological analyses were undertaken on NMJs of rectus abdominis obtained from patients undergoing upper GI cancer surgery compared with controls (N = 30; n = 1,165 NMJs). Cancer patients included those with cachexia and weight-stable disease. Despite the low skeletal muscle index and significant muscle fiber atrophy (P &lt; 0.0001) in patients with cachexia, NMJ morphology was fully conserved. No significant differences were observed in any of the pre- and postsynaptic variables measured. We conclude that NMJs remain structurally intact in rectus abdominis in both cancer and cachexia, suggesting that denervation of skeletal muscle is not a major driver of pathogenesis. The absence of NMJ pathology is in stark contrast to what is found in related conditions, such as age-related sarcopenia, and supports the hypothesis that intrinsic changes within skeletal muscle, independent of any changes in motor neurons, represent the primary locus of neuromuscular pathology in cancer cachexia.",2020,Neuromuscular disease; Neuroscience; Oncology; Cachexia; Female; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Neuromuscular Junction; Rectus Abdominis,1

Here, we first analyzed the DLBCL dataset from the UK-based Haematological Malignancy Research Network. Patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups based on whether lymphoma progressed within 24&#xa0;months. Genes showing significantly different frequencies between groups were selected. Survival data for patients with the selected mutant genes were analyzed. The results were validated using two other large databases to evaluate the relationship between the selected mutant genes and prognosis. The mutation frequencies of 11 genes (MYD88[L265P], SGK1, MPEG1, TP53, SPEN, NOTCH1, ETV6, TNFRSF14, MGA, CIITA, and PIM1) significantly differed between the high- and low-risk groups. The relationships between these mutant genes and patient survival were analyzed. Patients who harbored SGK1 (serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1) mutations exhibited the best prognosis. Most patients with SGK1 mutation are germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype. Among patients with GCB DLBCL, those harboring SGK1 mutations exhibited better prognosis than those without SGK1 mutations. Most SGK1 mutations were single-base substitutions, primarily scattered throughout the catalytic domain-encoding region. Multiple SGK1 mutations were identified in a single patient. Thus, SGK1 mutations are a marker of good prognosis for DLBCL and occur predominantly in the GCB subtype of DLBCL. SGK1 mutation status can further stratify patients with GCB DLBCL into different prognostic subgroups.",2022,"SGK1; classification; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; genetics; prognosis; B-Lymphocytes; Germinal Center; Humans; Immediate-Early Proteins; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse; Mutation; Prognosis; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases",1

To investigate whether these mutations are the cause or consequence of CD8<sup>+</sup> T&#xa0;cell clonal expansions and autoimmunity, we analyzed patients and mice with germline STAT3 GOF mutations. STAT3 GOF mutations drove the accumulation of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T&#xa0;cell clones highly expressing NKG2D, the receptor for stress-induced MHC-class-I-related molecules. This subset&#xa0;also expressed genes for granzymes, perforin, interferon-&#x3b3;, and Ccl5/Rantes and required NKG2D and the IL-15/IL-2 receptor IL2RB for maximal accumulation. Leukocyte-restricted STAT3 GOF was sufficient and CD8<sup>+</sup> T&#xa0;cells were essential for lethal pathology in mice.

36439494,IL2RB,10.3389/fonc.2022.941868,Characterization of genomic alterations and neoantigens and analysis of immune infiltration identified therapeutic and prognostic biomarkers in adenocarcinoma at the gastroesophageal junction.,"Adenocarcinoma at the gastroesophageal junction (ACGEJ) refers to a malignant tumor that occurs at the esophagogastric junction. Despite some progress in targeted therapies for HER2, FGFR2, EGFR, MET, Claudin 18.2 and immune checkpoints in ACGEJ tumors, the 5-year survival rate of patients remains poor. Thus, it is urgent to explore genomic alterations and neoantigen characteristics of tumors and identify CD8+ T-cell infiltration-associated genes to find potential therapeutic targets and develop a risk model to predict ACGEJ patients' overall survival (OS). Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 55 paired samples from Chinese ACGEJ patients. Somatic mutations and copy number variations were detected by Strelka2 and FACETS, respectively. SigProfiler and SciClone were employed to decipher the mutation signature and clonal structure of each sample, respectively. Neoantigens were predicted using the MuPeXI pipeline. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of ACGEJ samples from our previous studies and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to identify genes significantly associated with CD8+ T-cell infiltration by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). To construct a risk model, we conducted LASSO and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Recurrent <i>MAP2K7</i>, <i>RNF43</i> and <i>RHOA</i> mutations were found in ACGEJ tumors. The COSMIC signature SBS17 was associated with ACGEJ progression. <i>CCNE1</i> and <i>VEGFA</i> were identified as putative CNV driver genes. <i>PI3KCA</i> and <i>TP53</i> mutations conferred selective advantages to cancer cells. The Chinese ACGEJ patient neoantigen landscape was revealed for the first time, and 58 potential neoantigens common to TSNAdb and IEDB were identified. Compared with Siewert type II samples, Siewert type III samples had significant enrichment of the SBS17 signature, a lower <i>TNFRSF14</i> copy number, a higher proportion of samples with complex clonal architecture and a higher neoantigen load. We identified 10 important CD8+ T-cell infiltration-related Hub genes (<i>CCL5</i>, <i>CD2</i>, <i>CST7</i>, <i>GVINP1</i>, <i>GZMK</i>, <i>IL2RB</i>, <i>IKZF3</i>, <i>PLA2G2D</i>, <i>P2RY10</i> and <i>ZAP70</i>) as potential therapeutic targets from the RNA-seq data.

Its most common chromosomal aberration is the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene, with ~25% of ETV6-RUNX1 patients also carrying PAX5 alterations. We have recreated this mutation background by inter-crossing Etv6-RUNX1 (Etv6 (RUNX1-SB)) and Pax5(+/-) mice and performed an in vivo analysis to find driver genes using Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated mutagenesis and also exome sequencing. Combination of Etv6-RUNX1 and Pax5(+/-) alleles generated a transplantable B220 + CD19+ B-ALL with a significant disease incidence. RNA-seq analysis showed a gene expression pattern consistent with arrest at the pre-B stage. Analysis of the transposon common insertion sites identified genes involved in B-cell development (Zfp423) and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Jak1, Stat5 and Il2rb), while exome sequencing revealed somatic hotspot mutations in Jak1 and Jak3 at residues analogous to those mutated in human leukemias, and also mutation of Trp53.

To systematically evaluate the determinants of immune response in CRC, we explored whether patients with diverse levels of immune cytolytic activity (CYT) have different patterns of chromothripsis and kataegis. Analysis of CRC genomic data from the TCGA, indicated an excess of chromothriptic clusters among CYT-low colon adenocarcinomas, affecting known cancer drivers (<i>APC, KRAS, BRAF, TP53</i> and <i>FBXW7</i>), immune checkpoints (<i>CD274, PDCD1LG2, IDO1/2</i> and <i>LAG3</i>) and immune-related genes (<i>ENTPD1, PRF1, NKG7, FAS, GZMA/B/H/K</i> and <i>CD73</i>). CYT-high tumors were characterized by hypermutation, enrichment in APOBEC-associated mutations and kataegis events, as well as APOBEC activation. We also assessed differences in the most prevalent mutational signatures (SBS15, SBS20, SBS54 and DBS2) across cytolytic subgroups. Regarding the composition of immune cells in the tumor milieu, we found enrichment of M1 macrophages, CD8+ T cells and Tregs, as well as higher CD8+ T-cells/Tregs ratio among CYT-high tumors. CYT-high patients had higher immunophenoscores, which is predictive of their responsiveness if they were to be treated with anti-PD-1 alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 drugs.

This is likely due to TF binding sites for pro-proliferative TFs common to pro-proliferative and pro-apoptosis-effector genes. Certain clinical datasets have indicated that molecular markers associated with higher proliferation rates lead to improved outcomes for patients with cancer. These observations have been extensively assessed on a general basis, however there has been little work dissecting feed-forward apoptosis signaling pathways that may represent specific distinctions between a pro-proliferative mechanism and a pro-apoptotic mechanism in samples from patients with cancer. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets and bioinformatic approaches, the present study reports that higher FOS expression levels, along with higher FOS target apoptosis-effector gene expression, is associated with an increased survival, while higher POU2F1 expression is associated with a reduced survival (average difference of 25.9 months survival).

Taking B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) and large deletions of 6q [del(6q)] as a model, we integrated analysis of functional cDNA clone tracking assays with patient genomic and transcriptomic data, to identify the transcription factors FOXO3 and PRDM1 as candidate tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Analysis of cell cycle and transcriptomic changes following overexpression of FOXO3 or PRDM1 indicated that they co-operate to promote cell cycle exit at the pre-B cell stage. FOXO1 abnormalities are absent in B-ALL, but like FOXO3, FOXO1 expression suppressed growth of TCF3::PBX1 and ETV6::RUNX1 B-ALL in-vitro. While both FOXOs induced PRDM1 and other genes contributing to late pre-B cell development, FOXO1 alone induced the key transcription factor, IRF4, and chemokine, CXCR4. CRISPR-Cas9 screening identified FOXO3 as a TSG, while FOXO1 emerged as essential for B-ALL growth. We relate this FOXO3-specific leukaemia-protective role to suppression of glycolysis based on integrated analysis of CRISPR-data and gene sets induced or suppressed by FOXO1 and FOXO3.

Several studies addressed genomic changes occurring during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) focusing on somatic variants, but without including copy number alterations (CNAs). We analyzed CNA profiles of 31 TNBC primary tumor samples before and after NAC and of 35 single circulating tumor cells (CTCs) collected prior, during and after treatment by using next-generation sequencing targeted profile and low-pass whole genome sequencing, respectively. In pre-treatment tissue samples, the most common gains occurred on chromosomes 1, 2 and 8, and SOX11 and MYC resulted the most altered genes. Notably, amplification of MSH2 (4/4 versus 0/12, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) and PRDM1 and deletion of PAX3 (4/4 versus 1/12, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) significantly characterized primary tumors of patients with pathological complete response. All patients with paired pre- and post-NAC samples reported a change in post-treatment CNAs compared to baseline, despite they showed at least one common alteration. CNAs detected after treatment involved genes within druggable pathways such as EGFR, cell cycle process and Ras signaling. In two patients, CTCs shared more alterations with residual rather than primary tumor involving genes such as MYC, BCL6, SOX2, FGFR4. The phylogenetic analysis of CTCs within a single patient revealed NAC impact on tumor evolution, suggesting a selection of driver events under treatment pressure. In conclusion, our data showed how chemoresistance might arise early from treatment-induced selection of clones already present in the primary tumor, and that the characterization of CNAs on single CTCs informs on cancer evolution and potential druggable targets.",2022,"Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Biopsy; Breast; Cohort Studies; DNA Copy Number Variations; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Humans; Mastectomy; Middle Aged; Mutation; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Neoplasm Staging; Neoplastic Cells, Circulating; Phylogeny; Prognosis; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms; Whole Genome Sequencing",10

In this study, we describe methodology using BCR or TLR ligation to obtain plasma cells that are phenotypically mature, have exited cell cycle and express a gene signature concordant with long-lived plasma cells. Dependent on the initial stimuli, the transcriptomes also show variation including the enhanced expression of matrisome components after BCR stimulation, suggestive of unique functional properties for the resultant plasma cells. Moreover, using the new culture conditions we demonstrate that alternative promoter choice regulating the expression of the master transcription factor Blimp-1/Prdm1 can be observed; when the canonical B cell promoter for <i>Prdm1</i> is deleted, differentiating B cells exhibit flexibility in the choice of promoter, dictated by the initiating stimulus, with preferential maintenance of expression following exposure to TLR ligation.

An emerging approach in cancer immunology involves the conditional induction of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), which are non-encapsulated ectopic lymphoid structures forming at sites of chronic, pathologic inflammation. Cutaneous melanoma (CM), a highly-immunogenic form of solid cancer, continues to rise in both incidence and mortality rate, with recent reports supporting a positive correlation between the presence of TLS in melanoma and beneficial treatment outcomes amongst advanced-stage patients. In this context, TLS in CM are postulated to serve as dynamic centers for the initiation of robust anti-tumor responses within affected regions of active disease. Given their potential importance to patient outcome, significant effort has been recently devoted to gaining a better understanding of TLS neogenesis and the influence these lymphoid organs exert within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we briefly review TLS structure, function, and response to treatment in the setting of CM. To uncover potential tumor-intrinsic mechanisms that regulate TLS formation, we have taken the novel perspective of evaluating TLS induction in melanomas impacted by common driver mutations in BRAF, PTEN, NRAS, KIT, PRDM1, and MITF. Through analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we show expression of DNA repair proteins (DRPs) including BRCA1, PAXIP, ERCC1, ERCC2, ERCC3, MSH2, and PMS2 to be negatively correlated with expression of pro-TLS genes, suggesting DRP loss may favor TLS development in support of improved patient outcome and patient response to interventional immunotherapy.",2021,"DNA repair proteins; cutaneous melanoma; driver mutations; tertiary lymphoid structures; tumor mutational burden; Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; Humans; Immunotherapy; Melanoma; Mutation; Prognosis; Skin Neoplasms; Tertiary Lymphoid Structures; Tumor Microenvironment",10

However, drivers of exhaustion remain poorly understood. As intratumoral exhausted T cells experience severe hypoxia, we hypothesized that metabolic stress alters their responses to other signals, specifically, persistent antigenic stimulation. In vitro, although CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells experiencing continuous stimulation or hypoxia alone differentiated into functional effectors, the combination rapidly drove T cell dysfunction consistent with exhaustion. Continuous stimulation promoted Blimp-1-mediated repression of PGC-1&#x3b1;-dependent mitochondrial reprogramming, rendering cells poorly responsive to hypoxia. Loss of mitochondrial function generated intolerable levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), sufficient to promote exhausted-like states, in part through phosphatase inhibition and the consequent activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells. Reducing T cell-intrinsic ROS and lowering tumor hypoxia limited T cell exhaustion, synergizing with immunotherapy. Thus, immunologic and metabolic signaling are intrinsically linked: through mitigation of metabolic stress, T cell differentiation can be altered to promote more functional cellular fates.",2021,"Animals; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cell Line, Tumor; Coculture Techniques; Energy Metabolism; Female; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Lymphocyte Activation; Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating; Male; Melanoma, Experimental; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Mitochondria; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha; Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Tumor Hypoxia; Tumor Microenvironment",10

Dysregulated expression of co-inhibitory receptors on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells promotes autoimmunity, whereas sustained overexpression on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells promotes T cell dysfunction or exhaustion, leading to impaired ability to clear chronic viral infections and diseases such as cancer<sup>1,2</sup>. Here, using RNA and protein expression profiling at single-cell resolution in mouse cells, we identify a module of co-inhibitory receptors that includes not only several known co-inhibitory receptors (PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3 and TIGIT) but also many new surface receptors. We functionally validated two new co-inhibitory receptors, activated protein C receptor (PROCR) and podoplanin (PDPN). The module of co-inhibitory receptors is co-expressed in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and is part of a larger co-inhibitory gene program that is shared by non-responsive T cells in several physiological contexts and is driven by the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-27.

Despite the clinical significance of metastatic spread, our understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive PDAC metastatic ability remains limited. By generating a genetically engineered mouse model of human PDAC, we uncover a transient subpopulation of cancer cells with exceptionally high metastatic ability. Global gene expression profiling and functional analyses uncovered the transcription factor BLIMP1 as a driver of PDAC metastasis. The highly metastatic PDAC subpopulation is enriched for hypoxia-induced genes, and hypoxia-mediated induction of BLIMP1 contributes to the regulation of a subset of hypoxia-associated gene expression programs. These findings support a model in which upregulation of BLIMP1 links microenvironmental cues to a metastatic stem cell character.<b>Significance:</b> PDAC is an almost uniformly lethal cancer, largely due to its tendency for metastasis. We define a highly metastatic subpopulation of cancer cells, uncover a key transcriptional regulator of metastatic ability, and define hypoxia as an important factor within the tumor microenvironment that increases metastatic proclivity. <i>Cancer Discov; 7(10); 1184-99. &#xa9;2017 AACR.</i><i>See related commentary by Vakoc and Tuveson, p. 1067</i><i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1047</i>.",2018,"Animals; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; Cell Hypoxia; Cell Line, Tumor; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genetic Engineering; Humans; Mice; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Transplantation; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Tumor Microenvironment; Up-Regulation",10

We developed a new computational method, robust to biological and technical variability, which identifies significant transcript isoform changes across multiple samples. We applied this method to more than 4000 samples from the The Cancer Genome Atlas project to obtain novel splicing signatures that are predictive for nine different cancer types, and find a specific signature for basal-like breast tumors involving the tumor-driver CTNND1. Additionally, our method identifies 244 isoform switches, for which the change occurs in the most abundant transcript. Some of these switches occur in known tumor drivers, including PPARG, CCND3, RALGDS, MITF, PRDM1, ABI1 and MYH11, for which the switch implies a change in the protein product. Moreover, some of the switches cannot be described with simple splicing events. Surprisingly, isoform switches are independent of somatic mutations, except for the tumor-suppressor FBLN2 and the oncogene MYH11. Our method reveals novel signatures of cancer in terms of transcript isoforms specifically expressed in tumors, providing novel potential molecular targets for prognosis and therapy.

While some ISFNs are associated with overt FL, others are incidentally identified as isolated or pure forms in individuals without evidence of overt FL. The prevalence of incidentally found isolated ISFN is approximately 3% in Europe; however, no screening study has been conducted in Asia. To investigate the incidence and clinicopathological characteristics of ISFNs in the Japanese population, we conducted histopathological screening of the lymph nodes (LNs) resected for solid tumours or inflammatory conditions. We screened for ISFN in 5700 LNs from 340 individuals using immunohistochemistry for BCL2 and identified seven ISFNs, with an incidence of 2.1%. The median age of the individuals with ISFN was 67&#x2009;years, none of whom developed overt FL, with a median follow-up of 59&#x2009;months. Next-generation sequencing was performed in five ISFNs, and 10 variants in seven FL-associated genes were identified. The identified variants included HIST1H1E (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2), ARID1A (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2), KMT2D (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), CARD11 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), BCL7A (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), CREBBP (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1) and TNFRSF14 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1). The incidence of isolated ISFN in the Japanese population is not significantly different from that in Europe, presumably reflecting the recent increase in FL in Japan.

Four individual tissue biopsies were obtained from each of the 47 patients (multi-sample cohort). One random cancer tissue biopsy was obtained from each of the rest 23 patients (single-sample cohort). A 10 mL of blood was collected from all patients and the circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted. A 605-gene panel was used for targeted sequencing with tissue and paired blood. Mutational landscape revealed significantly higher mutational frequency in <i>APC, CARD11</i> and <i>CSMD3</i> in multi-sample cohort than single-sample cohort (P&lt;0.05).

The aim of this study was to examine potential biomarkers, including deficiency in mismatch repair proteins (dMMR)/microsatellite instability (MSI-H) in sinonasal cancers and their precancerous lesions. A comprehensive analysis of 10 sinonasal cancer cell lines by whole exome sequencing, screening 174 sinonasal tumors by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for mismatch repair deficiency and next generation sequencing (NGS) of 136 tumor samples revealed a dMMR/MSI-H sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SNSCC) cell line based on a somatic missense mutation in <i>MLH1</i> and an overall frequency of dMMR/MSI-H SNSCC of 3.2% (4/125).

There are over 20 BTKi, both irreversible and reversible, in clinical development. While loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in the <i>BTK</i> gene cause the immunodeficiency X-linked agammaglobulinemia, neither inherited, nor somatic <i>BTK</i> driver mutations are known. Instead, BTKi-sensitive malignancies are addicted to BTK. BTK is activated by upstream surface receptors, especially the B cell receptor (BCR) but also by chemokine receptors, and adhesion molecules regulating B cell homing. Consequently, BTKi therapy abrogates BCR-driven proliferation and the tissue homing capacity of the malignant cells, which are being redistributed into peripheral blood. BTKi resistance can develop over time, especially in MCL and high-risk CLL patients. Frequently, resistance mutations affect the BTKi binding-site, cysteine 481, thereby reducing drug binding. Less common are gain-of-function (GoF) mutations in downstream signaling components, including phospholipase C&#x3b3;2 (PLC&#x3b3;2). In a subset of patients, mechanisms outside of the BCR pathway, related e.g. to resistance to apoptosis were described. BCR signaling depends on many proteins including SYK, BTK, PI3K; still based on the resistance pattern, BTKi therapy only selects GoF alterations in the NF-&#x3ba;B arm, whereas an inhibitor of the p110&#x3b4; subunit of PI3K instead selects resistance mutations in the RAS-MAP kinase pathway. BTK and PLC&#x3b3;2 resistance mutations highlight BTK's non-redundant role in BCR-mediated NF-&#x3ba;B activation. Of note, mutations affecting BTK tend to generate clone sizes larger than alterations in PLC&#x3b3;2. This infers that BTK signaling may go beyond the PLC&#x3b3;2-regulated NF-&#x3ba;B and NFAT arms. Collectively, when comparing the primary and acquired mutation spectrum in BTKi-sensitive malignancies with the phenotype of the corresponding germline alterations, we find that certain observations do not readily fit with the existing models of BCR signaling.",2021,"B cell receptor; Btk; CARD11; Waldenstr&#xf6;m&#x2019;s macroglobulinemia; chronic lymphocytic leukemia; ibrutinib; mantle cell lymphoma; resistance mutation; Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase; Animals; B-Lymphocytes; CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Guanylate Cyclase; Hematologic Neoplasms; Humans; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Mutation; NF-kappa B; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Phospholipase C gamma; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Signal Transduction; ras Proteins",14

The low prevalence of ATL among human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) carriers and the long latency period before ATL onset suggest that additional genetic lesions are required for ATL leukemogenesis. Recently, a large-scale genetic analysis clarified the entire picture of genetic alterations, identified a number of novel driver genes, and delineated their characteristics. Frequent alterations are observed in the molecules belonging to T-cell receptor/NF-&#x3ba;B signaling and other T-cell-related pathways. A notable feature of the ATL genome is the predominance of gain-of-function alterations, including activating mutations in PLCG1, PRKCB, and CARD11. As many as one-fourth of all ATL cases harbor structural variations disrupting the 3'-untranslated region of the PD-L1 gene, leading to immune evasion of tumor cells. The frequency and pattern of these somatic alterations differ among clinical subtypes. Aggressive subtypes are associated with an increased burden of genetic alterations, and higher frequencies of TP53 and IRF4 mutations, PD-L1 amplifications, and CDKN2A deletions than indolent subtypes. In contrast, STAT3 mutations are more characteristic of indolent ATL. Furthermore, these subtypes are further classified into molecularly distinct subsets with a different prognosis by genetic alterations.

We obtained a total of 53 samples from MCL patients from five Korean university hospitals between 2009 and 2016. We identified the recurrently mutated genes such as SYNE1, ATM, KMT2D, CARD11, ANK2, KMT2C, and TP53, which included some known drivers of MCL. The mutational profiles of our cohort indicated genetic heterogeneity. The significantly enriched pathways were mainly involved in gene expression, cell cycle, and programmed cell death. Multivariate analysis revealed that ANK2 mutations impacted the unfavourable overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 3.126; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.032).

Expression of ETV6-RUNX1 induces a preleukemic condition leading to acquisition of secondary driver mutations, but the mechanism is poorly understood. SPI-B (encoded by SPIB) is an important transcriptional activator of B-cell development and differentiation. We hypothesized that SPIB is directly transcriptionally repressed by ETV6-RUNX1. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we identified a regulatory region in the first intron of SPIB that interacts with ETV6-RUNX1. Mutation of the RUNX1 binding site in SPIB intron 1 prevented transcriptional repression in transient transfection assays. Next, we sought to determine to what extent gene expression in REH cells can be altered by ectopic SPI-B expression. SPI-B expression was forced using CRISPR-mediated gene activation and also using a retroviral vector. Forced expression of SPI-B resulted in altered gene expression and, at high levels, impaired cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Finally, we identified CARD11 and CDKN1A (encoding p21) as transcriptional targets of SPI-B involved in regulation of proliferation and apoptosis.

Fisher's exact test was used to perform transcription factors (TFs) and genomic region enrichment. Gene expression profiles were downloaded from TCGA to assess expression differences. Immune cell fraction was calculated to quantify the immune cells infiltration. Putative neo-epitopes were predicted from somatic mutations. Three subclasses were identified: Class 1 correlating with the CA subtype and Classes 2 and 3 dividing the CSCC subtype into two subclasses. We found the hypomethylated probes in Class 3 exhibited strong enrichment in promoter region as compared with Class 2. Five TFs significantly enriched in the hypomethylated promoters and their highly expressed target genes in Class 3 functionally involved in the immune pathway. Gene function analysis revealed that immune-related genes were significantly increased in Class 3, and a higher level of immune cell infiltration was estimated. High expression of 24 immune genes exhibited a better overall survival and correlated with neo-epitope burden. Additionally, we found only two immune-related driver genes, <i>CARD11</i> and <i>JAK3</i>, to be significantly increased in Class 3. Our analyses provide a classification of the largest CSCC subtype into two new subclasses, revealing they harbored differences in immune-related gene expression.",2019,"cervical cancer; classification; immune; methylation; neo-epitopes; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; DNA Methylation; Epitopes; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genome, Human; Humans; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Binding; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",14

Here we investigated whether mRNA events that are upregulated in cancer can functionally mimic the outcome of genetic alterations. RNA sequencing or 3'-end sequencing techniques were applied to normal and malignant B cells from 59 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)<sup>1-3</sup>. We discovered widespread upregulation of truncated mRNAs and proteins in primary CLL cells that were not generated by genetic alterations but instead occurred by intronic polyadenylation. Truncated mRNAs caused by intronic polyadenylation were recurrent (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;330) and predominantly affected genes with tumour-suppressive functions. The truncated proteins generated by intronic polyadenylation often lack the tumour-suppressive functions of the corresponding full-length proteins (such as DICER and FOXN3), and several even acted in an oncogenic manner (such as CARD11, MGA and CHST11). In CLL, the inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes by aberrant mRNA processing is substantially more prevalent than the functional loss of such genes through genetic events. We further identified new candidate tumour-suppressor genes that are inactivated by intronic polyadenylation in leukaemia and by truncating DNA mutations in solid tumours<sup>4,5</sup>. These genes are understudied in cancer, as their overall mutation rates are lower than those of well-known tumour-suppressor genes. Our findings show the need to go beyond genomic analyses in cancer diagnostics, as mRNA events that are silent at the DNA level are widespread contributors to cancer pathogenesis through the inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes.",2019,"B-Lymphocytes; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Humans; Introns; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell; Polyadenylation; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Sequence Deletion",14

To provide insight into the regulatory network of MEF2B, in this study, we analyse global gene expression and DNA-binding patterns. We find that candidate MEF2B direct target genes include RHOB, RHOD, CDH13, ITGA5 and CAV1, and that indirect target genes of MEF2B include MYC, TGFB1, CARD11, MEF2C, NDRG1 and FN1. MEF2B overexpression increases HEK293A cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and decreases DLBCL cell chemotaxis. K4E, Y69H and D83V MEF2B mutations decrease the capacity of MEF2B to activate transcription and decrease its' effects on cell migration. The K4E and D83V mutations decrease MEF2B DNA binding.

In an increasing number of B-cell malignancies, BCR signaling is implicated as a pivotal pathway in tumorigenesis. Mechanisms of BCR activation are quite diverse and range from chronic antigenic drive by microbial or viral antigens to autostimulation of B-cells by self-antigens to activating mutations in intracellular components of the BCR pathway. Hepatitis C virus infection can lead to the development of splenic marginal zone lymphoma, while Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with the development of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. In some of these cases, successful treatment of the infection removes the inciting antigen and results in resolution of the lymphoma. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia has been recognized for decades as a malignancy of auto-reactive B-cells and its clinical course is in part determined by the differential response of the malignant cells to BCR activation. In a number of B-cell malignancies, activating mutations in signal transduction components of the BCR pathway have been identified; prominent examples are activated B-cell-like (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) that carry mutations in CD79B and CARD11 and display chronic active BCR signaling resulting in constitutive activation of the NF-&#x3ba;B pathway. Despite considerable heterogeneity in biology and clinical course, many mature B-cell malignancies are highly sensitive to kinase inhibitors that disrupt BCR signaling. Thus, targeted therapy through inhibition of BCR signaling is emerging as a new treatment paradigm for many B-cell malignancies. Here, we review the role of the BCR in the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies and summarize clinical results of the emerging class of kinase inhibitors that target this pathway.",2014,"Antigen; B-cell receptor; Ibrutinib; Idelalisib; Lymphoma; Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase; B-Lymphocytes; CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins; CD79 Antigens; Enzyme Inhibitors; Guanylate Cyclase; Humans; Lymphoma; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Mutation; Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell; Signal Transduction",14
22343534,CARD11,10.1073/pnas.1121343109,Discovery and prioritization of somatic mutations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by whole-exome sequencing.,"To gain insight into the genomic basis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we performed massively parallel whole-exome sequencing of 55 primary tumor samples from patients with DLBCL and matched normal tissue. We identified recurrent mutations in genes that are well known to be functionally relevant in DLBCL, including MYD88, CARD11, EZH2, and CREBBP. We also identified somatic mutations in genes for which a functional role in DLBCL has not been previously suspected. These genes include MEF2B, MLL2, BTG1, GNA13, ACTB, P2RY8, PCLO, and TNFRSF14. Further, we show that BCL2 mutations commonly occur in patients with BCL2/IgH rearrangements as a result of somatic hypermutation normally occurring at the IgH locus. The BCL2 point mutations are primarily synonymous, and likely caused by activation-induced cytidine deaminase-mediated somatic hypermutation, as shown by comprehensive analysis of enrichment of mutations in WRCY target motifs. Those nonsynonymous mutations that are observed tend to be found outside of the functionally important BH domains of the protein, suggesting that strong negative selection against BCL2 loss-of-function mutations is at play. Last, by using an algorithm designed to identify likely functionally relevant but infrequent mutations, we identify KRAS, BRAF, and NOTCH1 as likely drivers of DLBCL pathogenesis in some patients. Our data provide an unbiased view of the landscape of mutations in DLBCL, and this in turn may point toward new therapeutic strategies for the disease.",2012,"Amino Acid Motifs; Cluster Analysis; DNA Mutational Analysis; Exome; Exons; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse; Models, Genetic; Mutation; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Translocation, Genetic",14

However, the influences of TKIs on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIM), especially dynamic changes of responders, have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, RNA sequencing and whole-exome sequencing were performed on EGFR/ALK-positive NSCLC samples before and after TKI treatment. In combination with neoantigen and mutational-load estimations, xCell and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were used to assess tumor immune-cell infiltration and activity. Furthermore, weighted-gene correlation network analysis and the bottleneck method were used to identify the hub genes that affected treatment-related immune responses. We found that TKI treatment remodeled the TIM in treatment-responsive samples. Profound increases in the rate of anti-tumor cell infiltration and cytotoxicity was observed following TKI treatment, while antigen presentation was limited in ALK-rearranged samples. However, no significant change in anti-tumor cell infiltration or cytotoxicity was found between pre-treatment and post-progression samples. Subsequently, we found that neurofilament heavy (NEFH) mutations were enriched in samples after TKI treatment and were associated with reduced neutrophil infiltration. The cytotoxicity of EGFR-mutant NSCLCs with co-driver TP53 mutation and ALK-rearranged samples with wild-type TP53 seems to be more easily induced by TKI. Finally, the immune-associated score generated by hub genes was positively correlated with immune infiltration, immune activation, and a favorable prognosis. In conclusion, the dynamic changes in the TIM provide clues to drug selection and timing for TKI-immunotherapy combinations.",2021,"ALK rearrangement; EGFR mutation; Tumor immune microenvironment; non-small-cell lung cancer; tyrosine kinase inhibitors; Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; ErbB Receptors; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Tumor Microenvironment",2

Although combined surgical therapy and chemoradiotherapy have improved the survival for patients with HPC over the past 3 decades, the mortality rate in late-stage diagnosis of HPC is unsatisfactory. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 23 hypopharyngeal tumor and paired adjacent normal tissue to identify novel candidate driver genes associated with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. We identified several copy number variants (CNVs) and 15 somatic mutation genes that were associated with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Mutations in nine new genes (PRB4, NSD1, REC8, ZNF772, ZNF69, EI24, CYFIP2, NEFH, KRTAP4-5) were also indentified. PRB4 and NSD1 expression were significantly upregulated in hypopharyngeal carcinoma, which was confirmed in an independent cohort using IHC. There was a positive relationship between PRB4 and NSD1. Downregulation of PRB4 by siRNA could inhibit cell growth, colony formation and cell invasion. Notably, we here demonstrate that NSD1 could bind to the promoter regions of PRB4 and activate promoter activity by reducing the binding of H3K27me2 and increasing the binding of H3K36me2 on PRB4 promoter. In summary, we pinpoint the predominant mutations in hypopharyngeal carcinoma by WES, highlighting the substantial genetic alterations contributing to hypopharyngeal carcinoma tumorigenesis. We also indentify a novel epigenetically regulatory between PRB4 and NSD1 that contribute to hypopharyngeal carcinoma tumorigenesis. They may become potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic target for hypopharyngeal carcinoma treatment.",2019,epigenetic; hypopharyngeal cancer; mutations; therapeutic target; whole-exome sequencing,2

In BRCA1 (Breast Cancer gene 1) - or BRCA2-wild type (BRCAwt) HGSOC patients, resistance and progressive disease occur earlier and more often than in mutated BRCA. Identification of biomarkers helpful in predicting response to first-line chemotherapy is a challenge to improve BRCAwt HGSOC management. To identify a gene signature that can predict response to first-line chemotherapy, pre-treatment tumor biopsies from a restricted cohort of BRCAwt HGSOC patients were profiled by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology. Patients were sub-grouped according to platinum-free interval (PFI), into sensitive (PFI&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;12&#x2009;months) and resistant (PFI&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;6&#x2009;months). The gene panel identified by RNA-seq analysis was then tested by high-throughput quantitative real-time PCR (HT RT-qPCR) in a validation cohort, and statistical/bioinformatic methods were used to identify eligible markers and to explore the relevant pathway/gene network enrichments of the identified gene set. Finally, a panel of primary HGSOC cell lines was exploited to uncover cell-autonomous mechanisms of resistance. RNA-seq identified a 42-gene panel discriminating sensitive and resistant BRCAwt HGSOC patients and pathway analysis pointed to the immune system as a possible driver of chemotherapy response. From the extended cohort analysis of the 42 DEGs (differentially expressed genes), a statistical approach combined with the random forest classifier model generated a ten-gene signature predictive of response to first-line chemotherapy. The ten-gene signature included: CKB (Creatine kinase B), CTNNBL1 (Catenin, beta like 1), GNG11 (G protein subunit gamma 11), IGFBP7 (Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7), PLCG2 (Phospholipase C, gamma 2), RNF24 (Ring finger protein 24), SLC15A3 (Solute carrier family 15 member 3), TSPAN31 (Tetraspanin 31), TTI1 (TELO2 interacting protein 1) and UQCC1 (Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex assembly factor). Cytotoxicity assays, combined with gene-expression analysis in primary HGSOC cell lines, allowed to define CTNNBL1, RNF24, and TTI1 as cell-autonomous contributors to tumor resistance. Using machine-learning techniques we have identified a gene signature that could predict response to first-line chemotherapy in BRCAwt HGSOC patients, providing a useful tool towards personalized treatment modalities.",2022,Bioinformatics; Biomarkers; Drug-resistance; HGSOC; Patient stratification; Primary ovarian cancer cells; Random forest classifier model; Transcriptomic; BRCA1 Protein; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Neoplasm Grading; Ovarian Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis,1

Previous studies have reported genomic drivers in OSCC, but much remains to be elucidated about DNA methylation patterns across different stages of oral carcinogenesis. There is a serious lack of biomarkers and clinical application of biomarkers for early detection and prognosis of gingivobuccal complex cancers. Hence, in search of novel biomarkers, we measured genome-wide DNA methylation in 22 normal oral tissues, 22 leukoplakia, and 74 GBC-OSCC tissue samples. Both leukoplakia and GBC-OSCC had distinct methylation profiles as compared to normal oral tissue samples. Aberrant DNA methylation increases during the different stages of oral carcinogenesis, from premalignant lesions to carcinoma. We identified 846 and 5111 differentially methylated promoters in leukoplakia and GBC-OSCC, respectively, with a sizable fraction shared between the two sets. Further, we identified potential biomarkers from integrative analysis in gingivobuccal complex cancers and validated them in an independent cohort. Integration of genome, epigenome, and transcriptome data revealed candidate genes with gene expression synergistically regulated by copy number and DNA methylation changes. Regularised Cox regression identified 32 genes associated with patient survival. In an independent set of samples, we validated eight genes (FAT1, GLDC, HOXB13, CST7, CYB5A, MLLT11, GHR, LY75) from the integrative analysis and 30 genes from previously published reports. Bisulfite pyrosequencing validated GLDC (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.036), HOXB13 (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) promoter hypermethylation, and FAT1 (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) hypomethylation in GBC-OSCC compared to normal controls.

36439494,CST7,10.3389/fonc.2022.941868,Characterization of genomic alterations and neoantigens and analysis of immune infiltration identified therapeutic and prognostic biomarkers in adenocarcinoma at the gastroesophageal junction.,"Adenocarcinoma at the gastroesophageal junction (ACGEJ) refers to a malignant tumor that occurs at the esophagogastric junction. Despite some progress in targeted therapies for HER2, FGFR2, EGFR, MET, Claudin 18.2 and immune checkpoints in ACGEJ tumors, the 5-year survival rate of patients remains poor. Thus, it is urgent to explore genomic alterations and neoantigen characteristics of tumors and identify CD8+ T-cell infiltration-associated genes to find potential therapeutic targets and develop a risk model to predict ACGEJ patients' overall survival (OS). Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 55 paired samples from Chinese ACGEJ patients. Somatic mutations and copy number variations were detected by Strelka2 and FACETS, respectively. SigProfiler and SciClone were employed to decipher the mutation signature and clonal structure of each sample, respectively. Neoantigens were predicted using the MuPeXI pipeline. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of ACGEJ samples from our previous studies and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to identify genes significantly associated with CD8+ T-cell infiltration by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). To construct a risk model, we conducted LASSO and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Recurrent <i>MAP2K7</i>, <i>RNF43</i> and <i>RHOA</i> mutations were found in ACGEJ tumors. The COSMIC signature SBS17 was associated with ACGEJ progression. <i>CCNE1</i> and <i>VEGFA</i> were identified as putative CNV driver genes. <i>PI3KCA</i> and <i>TP53</i> mutations conferred selective advantages to cancer cells. The Chinese ACGEJ patient neoantigen landscape was revealed for the first time, and 58 potential neoantigens common to TSNAdb and IEDB were identified. Compared with Siewert type II samples, Siewert type III samples had significant enrichment of the SBS17 signature, a lower <i>TNFRSF14</i> copy number, a higher proportion of samples with complex clonal architecture and a higher neoantigen load. We identified 10 important CD8+ T-cell infiltration-related Hub genes (<i>CCL5</i>, <i>CD2</i>, <i>CST7</i>, <i>GVINP1</i>, <i>GZMK</i>, <i>IL2RB</i>, <i>IKZF3</i>, <i>PLA2G2D</i>, <i>P2RY10</i> and <i>ZAP70</i>) as potential therapeutic targets from the RNA-seq data.

Inflammation, stromal cells, and the immune landscape have been identified as significant drivers of BC in multiple preclinical studies. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the predictive relevance of stromal and immune cell-associated genes in patients suffering from BC. We employed the estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) algorithm to calculate the stromal and immunological scores, which were then used to evaluate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BC samples using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Univariate analyses were conducted to identify the DEGs linked to survival in BC patients. Next, the prognostic DEGs (with a log-rank P&lt;0.05) were used to create a risk signature, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method was used to analyze and optimize the risk signature. The following formula was used to compute the prognostic risk score values: Risk score = Gene 1 * &#x3b2;1 + Gene 2 * &#x3b2;2 +&#x2026; Gene n * &#x3b2;n. The median prognostic risk score values were used to divide BC patients into the low-risk (LR) and high-risk (HR) groups. The patient samples of the validation cohort were then assessed using this formula. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the expression patterns of the different patient groups. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to determine whether there were significant variations between the groups in the evaluated gene sets. The present study revealed that DEGs linked with survival were closely associated with immunological responses. A prognostic signature was constructed that consisted of 12 genes (<i>ASCL1, BHLHE22, C1S, CLEC9A, CST7, EEF1A2, FOLR2, KLRB1, MEOX1, PEX5L, PLA2G2D,</i> and <i>PPP1R16B</i>). According to their survival, BC patients were separated into LR and HR groups using the identified 12-gene signature. The immunological status and immune cell infiltration were observed differently in the LR and HR groups.

We hypothesized that immunosuppression in glioblastoma limits D2C7-IT efficacy. To improve the response rate and reverse immunosuppression, we combined D2C7-IT tumor cell killing with &#x3b1;CD40 costimulation of antigen-presenting cells. In murine glioma models, a single intratumoral injection of D2C7-IT+&#x3b1;CD40 treatment activated a proinflammatory phenotype in microglia and macrophages, promoted long-term tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity, and generated cures.

Memory B&#xa0;cell and plasma cell infiltrates have previously been associated with better outcomes in ovarian cancer<sup>5,6</sup>, but the nature and functional relevance of these responses are controversial. Here, using 3&#xa0;independent cohorts that in total comprise 534&#xa0;patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer, we show that robust, protective humoral responses are dominated by the production of polyclonal IgA, which binds to polymeric IgA receptors that are universally expressed on ovarian cancer cells. Notably, tumour B-cell-derived IgA redirects myeloid cells against extracellular oncogenic drivers, which causes tumour cell death. In addition, IgA transcytosis through malignant epithelial cells elicits transcriptional changes that antagonize the RAS pathway and sensitize tumour cells to cytolytic killing by T cells, which also contributes to hindering malignant progression. Thus, tumour-antigen-specific and -antigen-independent IgA responses antagonize the growth of ovarian cancer by governing coordinated tumour cell, T cell and B&#xa0;cell responses. These findings provide a platform for identifying targets that are spontaneously recognized by intratumoural B-cell-derived antibodies, and suggest that immunotherapies that augment B&#xa0;cell responses may be more effective than approaches that focus on T cells, particularly for malignancies that are resistant to checkpoint inhibitors.",2021,"Antibody Specificity; Antigens, CD; Antigens, Neoplasm; Cell Line; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin A; Ovarian Neoplasms; Receptors, Fc; Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic; Transcytosis; Tumor Microenvironment",2

A recently developed tool well suited for this line of investigation is the Pdx-1-Cre;Cdh1<sup>F/+</sup> ;Trp53<sup>F/F</sup> ;Smad4<sup>F/F</sup> (pC<sup>he</sup> PS) mouse model that spontaneously develops metastatic DGC showing nearly complete E-cadherin loss. Here, we performed a proteogenomic analysis to uncover the molecular changes induced by the concurrent targeting of E-cadherin, p53, and Smad4 loss. The gene expression profiles of mouse DGCs and in vivo gastric phenotypes from various combinations of gene knockout demonstrated that these mutations collaborate to activate cancer-associated pathways to generate aggressive DGC. Of note, WNT-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and extracellular matrix (ECM)-cytokine receptor interactions were prominently featured. In particular, the WNT target gene osteopontin (OPN) that functions as an ECM cytokine is highly upregulated. In validation experiments, OPN contributed to DGC stemness by promoting cancer stem cell (CSC) survival and chemoresistance. It was further found that Bcl-xL acts as a targetable downstream effector of OPN in DGC CSC survival. In addition, Zeb2 and thymosin-&#x3b2;4 (T&#x3b2;4) were identified as prime candidates as suppressors of E-cadherin expression from the remaining Cdh1 allele during DGC development.

Therefore, we reinvestigated the role of endogenous expression of JAK2(V617F) on early steps of hematopoiesis as well as the effect of interferon-&#x3b1; (IFN&#x3b1;), which may target the JAK2(V617F) clone in humans by using knock-in mice with conditional expression of JAK2(V617F) in hematopoietic cells. These mice develop a MPN mimicking polycythemia vera with large amplification of myeloid mature and precursor cells, displaying erythroid endogenous growth and progressing to myelofibrosis. Interestingly, early hematopoietic compartments [Lin-, LSK, and SLAM (LSK/CD48-/CD150+)] increased with the age. Competitive repopulation assays demonstrated disease appearance and progressive overgrowth of myeloid, Lin-, LSK, and SLAM cells, but not lymphocytes, from a low number of engrafted JAK2(V617F) SLAM cells. Finally, IFN&#x3b1; treatment prevented disease development by specifically inhibiting JAK2(V617F) cells at an early stage of differentiation and eradicating disease-initiating cells. This study shows that JAK2(V617F) in mice amplifies not only late but also early hematopoietic cells, giving them a proliferative advantage through high cell cycling and low apoptosis that may sustain MPN emergence but is lost upon IFN&#x3b1; treatment.",2013,"Animals; Apoptosis; Bone Marrow Cells; Bone Marrow Transplantation; Cell Cycle; Crosses, Genetic; Disease Models, Animal; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Janus Kinase 2; Lymphocytes; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Mutation; Myeloproliferative Disorders; Phenotype; Polycythemia Vera; Primary Myelofibrosis; Stem Cells",2

Researchers have identified that protein pocket regions play critical roles in the interaction of proteins with small molecules, enzymes, and nucleic acid. As such, investigating the features of somatic mutations in protein pocket regions provides a promising approach to identifying new genotype-phenotype relationships in cancer. In this study, we developed a protein pocket-based computational approach to uncover the functional consequences of somatic mutations in cancer. We mapped 1.2 million somatic mutations across 36 cancer types from the COSMIC database and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) onto the protein pocket regions of over 5,000 protein three-dimensional structures. We further integrated cancer cell line mutation profiles and drug pharmacological data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) onto protein pocket regions in order to identify putative biomarkers for anticancer drug responses. We found that genes harboring protein pocket somatic mutations were significantly enriched in cancer driver genes. Furthermore, genes harboring pocket somatic mutations tended to be highly co-expressed in a co-expressed protein interaction network. Using a statistical framework, we identified four putative cancer genes (RWDD1, NCF1, PLEK, and VAV3), whose expression profiles were associated with overall poor survival rates in melanoma, lung, or colorectal cancer patients. Finally, genes harboring protein pocket mutations were more likely to be drug-sensitive or drug-resistant. In a case study, we illustrated that the BAX gene was associated with the sensitivity of three anticancer drugs (midostaurin, vinorelbine, and tipifarnib). This study provides novel insights into the functional consequences of somatic mutations during tumorigenesis and for anticancer drug responses. The computational approach used might be beneficial to the study of somatic mutations in the era of cancer precision medicine.",2014,NA,1

We leveraged paired whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing in the largest LGL leukemia cohort to date, which included 105 patients (93 T-cell receptor &#x3b1;&#x3b2; [TCR&#x3b1;&#x3b2;] T-LGL and 12 TCR&#x3b3;&#x3b4; T-LGL). Seventy-six mutations were observed in 3 or more patients in the cohort, and out of those, STAT3, KMT2D, PIK3R1, TTN, EYS, and SULF1 mutations were shared between both subtypes. We identified ARHGAP25, ABCC9, PCDHA11, SULF1, SLC6A15, DDX59, DNMT3A, FAS, KDM6A, KMT2D, PIK3R1, STAT3, STAT5B, TET2, and TNFAIP3 as recurrently mutated putative drivers using an unbiased driver analysis approach leveraging our whole-exome cohort. Hotspot mutations in STAT3, PIK3R1, and FAS were detected, whereas truncating mutations in epigenetic modifying enzymes such as KMT2D and TET2 were observed. Moreover, STAT3 mutations co-occurred with mutations in chromatin and epigenetic modifying genes, especially KMT2D and SETD1B (P &lt; .01 and P &lt; .05, respectively). STAT3 was mutated in 50.5% of the patients. Most common Y640F STAT3 mutation was associated with lower absolute neutrophil count values, and N647I mutation was associated with lower hemoglobin values. Somatic activating mutations (Q160P, D170Y, L287F) in the STAT3 coiled-coil domain were characterized. STAT3-mutant patients exhibited increased mutational burden and enrichment of a mutational signature associated with increased spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine. Finally, gene expression analysis revealed enrichment of interferon-&#x3b3; signaling and decreased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling for STAT3-mutant patients.

Despite their exquisite specificity, these driver oncogenes have been considered largely undruggable due to their lack of enzymatic activity.Here, we show in the EwS model that - capitalizing on neomorphic DNA-binding preferences - the addiction to the respective fusion transcription factor EWSR1-FLI1 can be leveraged to express therapeutic genes.We genetically engineered a de novo enhancer-based, synthetic and highly potent expression cassette that can elicit EWSR1-FLI1-dependent expression of a therapeutic payload as evidenced by episomal and CRISPR-edited genomic reporter assays. Combining in silico screens and immunohistochemistry, we identified GPR64 as a highly specific cell surface antigen for targeted transduction strategies in EwS. Functional experiments demonstrated that anti-GPR64-pseudotyped lentivirus harboring our expression cassette can specifically transduce EwS cells to promote the expression of viral thymidine kinase sensitizing EwS for treatment to otherwise relatively non-toxic (Val)ganciclovir and leading to strong anti-tumorigenic, but no adverse effects in vivo. Further, we prove that similar vector designs can be applied in PAX3-FOXO1-driven ARMS, and to express immunomodulatory cytokines, such as IL-15 and XCL1, in tumor entities typically considered to be immunologically 'cold'.Collectively, these results generated in pediatric sarcomas indicate that exploiting, rather than suppressing, the neomorphic functions of chimeric transcription factors may open inroads to innovative and personalized therapies, and that our highly versatile approach may be translatable to other cancers addicted to oncogenic transcription factors with unique DNA-binding properties.",2022,"Cancer gene therapy; Ewing sarcoma; Fusion oncogene; GPR64; Rhabdomyosarcoma; Targeted therapy; Antigens, Surface; Cell Line, Tumor; Child; DNA; Ganciclovir; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Interleukin-15; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1; RNA-Binding Protein EWS; Sarcoma; Sarcoma, Ewing; Thymidine Kinase",2

Chronic necro-inflammation is a critical factor in development of NASH, yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms of immune dysregulation in this disease are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we comprehensively profiled the immune composition of the mouse liver during NASH. We identified a significant pathology-associated increase in hepatic conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and further defined their source as NASH-induced boost in cycling of cDC progenitors in the bone marrow. Analysis of blood and liver from patients on the NAFLD/NASH spectrum showed that type 1 cDCs (cDC1) were more abundant and activated in disease. Sequencing of physically interacting cDC-T cell pairs from liver-draining lymph nodes revealed that cDCs in NASH promote inflammatory T cell reprogramming, previously associated with NASH worsening. Finally, depletion of cDC1 in XCR1<sup>DTA</sup> mice or using anti-XCL1-blocking antibody attenuated liver pathology in NASH mouse models. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of cDC biology in NASH and identifies XCR1<sup>+</sup> cDC1 as an important driver of liver pathology.",2021,"Animals; Bone Marrow Cells; Cellular Reprogramming; Dendritic Cells; Diet, High-Fat; Disease Models, Animal; Fatty Liver; Female; Humans; Liver; Lymph Nodes; Male; Mice; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Receptors, Chemokine; T-Lymphocytes",2

Through genome-wide screening for aberrantly methylated CpG islands (CGIs) in 12 clinically uniform, stage-I LADC cases affecting six non-smokers and six smokers, we identified candidate tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) inactivated by hypermethylation. Through systematic expression analyses of those candidates in panels of additional tumor samples and cell lines treated or not treated with 5-aza-deoxycitidine followed by validation analyses of cancer-specific silencing by CGI hypermethylation using a public database, we identified TRIM58 as the most prominent candidate for TSG. TRIM58 was robustly silenced by hypermethylation even in early-stage primary LADC, and the restoration of TRIM58 expression in LADC cell lines inhibited cell growth in vitro and in vivo in anchorage-dependent and -independent manners. Our findings suggest that aberrant inactivation of TRIM58 consequent to CGI hypermethylation might stimulate the early carcinogenesis of LADC regardless of smoking status; furthermore, TRIM58 methylation might be a possible early diagnostic and epigenetic therapeutic target in LADC.",2018,"TRIM58; early-stage lung adenocarcinoma; methylation; smoking status; tumor suppressor gene; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Adenocarcinoma; Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Cell Cycle; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Disease Models, Animal; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenomics; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Silencing; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Ubiquitin",1

Many desmoplastic tumours including breast cancer involve the significant accumulation of type I collagen. However, recently it has become clear that the precise distribution and organisation of matrix molecules such as collagen I is equally as important in the tumour as their abundance. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) coexist within breast cancer tissues and play both pro- and anti-tumourigenic roles through remodelling the ECM. Here, using temporal proteomic profiling of decellularized tumours, we interrogate the evolving matrisome during breast cancer progression. We identify 4 key matrisomal clusters, and pinpoint collagen type XII as a critical component that regulates collagen type I organisation. Through combining our proteomics with single-cell transcriptomics, and genetic manipulation models, we show how CAF-secreted collagen XII alters collagen I organisation to create a pro-invasive microenvironment supporting metastatic dissemination. Finally, we show in patient cohorts that collagen XII may represent an indicator of breast cancer patients at high risk of metastatic relapse.",2022,"Breast Neoplasms; Collagen; Collagen Type I; Collagen Type XII; Extracellular Matrix; Female; Humans; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Proteomics; Tumor Microenvironment",2
33381592,COL12A1,10.1155/2020/8859826,Identification of Core Prognosis-Related Candidate Genes in Chinese Gastric Cancer Population Based on Integrated Bioinformatics.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. There are great geographical differences in the incidence of GC, and somatic mutation rates of driver genes are also different. The present study is aimed at screening core prognosis-related candidate genes in Chinese gastric cancer population based on integrated bioinformatics for the early diagnosis and prognosis of GC. In the present study, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GC were identified using four microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The samples of these datasets were all from China. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was conducted to evaluate the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in GC. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and cytoHubba were performed to determine hub genes associated with GC. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) were performed to validate the hub genes. A total of 240 DEGs were obtained through the RRA method, including 80 upregulated genes and 160 downregulated genes. Upregulated genes were mainly enriched in extracellular matrix organization, extracellular matrix, and extracellular matrix structural constituent. The downregulated genes were mainly enriched in digestion, extracellular space, and oxidoreductase activity. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the upregulated genes were mainly associated with ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. And downregulated genes were mainly associated with the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, metabolic pathways, and gastric acid secretion. The transcriptional and translational expression levels of the genes including <i>COL1A1</i>, <i>COL5A2</i>, <i>COL12A1</i>, and <i>VCAN</i> were higher in GC tissues than normal tissues. A total of four genes including <i>COL1A1</i>, <i>COL5A2</i>, <i>COL12A1</i>, and <i>VCAN</i> were considered potential GC biomarkers in the Chinese population. And ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were revealed to be important mechanisms of GC.

Most HTLV-1-infected individuals are asymptomatic, and only 3% to 5% of carriers develop ATL. Here, we describe the contribution of aberrant DNA methylation to ATL leukemogenesis. HTLV-1-infected T-cells and their uninfected counterparts were separately isolated based on CADM1 and CD7 expression status, and differentially methylated positions (DMPs) specific to HTLV-infected T cells were identified through genome-wide DNA methylation profiling. Accumulation of DNA methylation at hypermethylated DMPs correlated strongly with ATL development and progression. In addition, we identified 22 genes downregulated because of promoter hypermethylation in HTLV-1-infected T cells, including THEMIS, LAIR1, and RNF130, which negatively regulate T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Phosphorylation of ZAP-70, a transducer of TCR signaling, was dysregulated in HTLV-1-infected cell lines but was normalized by reexpression of THEMIS. Therefore, we hypothesized that DNA hypermethylation contributes to growth advantages in HTLV-1-infected cells during ATL leukemogenesis. To test this idea, we investigated the anti-ATL activities of OR-1200 and OR-2100 (OR21), novel decitabine (DAC) prodrugs with enhanced oral bioavailability. Both DAC and OR21 inhibited cell growth, accompanied by global DNA hypomethylation, in xenograft tumors established by implantation of HTLV-1-infected cells. OR21 was less hematotoxic than DAC, whereas tumor growth inhibition was almost identical between the 2 compounds, making it suitable for long-term treatment of ATL patient-derived xenograft mice. Our results demonstrate that regional DNA hypermethylation is functionally important for ATL leukemogenesis and an effective therapeutic target.",2021,"Administration, Oral; Adult; Aged; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Transformation, Viral; Cells, Cultured; DNA Methylation; Demethylation; Drugs, Investigational; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic; HTLV-I Infections; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; Humans; Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Knockout; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Pyridines; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; Young Adult",1

Great advances have been made over the last decades, however, most studies predict driver genes of breast cancer using biological experiments and/or computational methods, regardless of stage information. In this study, we propose a computational framework to predict the disease genes of breast cancer based on stage-specific gene regulatory networks. Firstly, we screen out differentially expressed genes and hypomethylated/hypermethylated genes by comparing tumor samples with corresponding normal samples. Secondly, we construct three stage-specific gene regulatory networks by integrating RNA-seq profiles and TF-target pairs, and apply WGCNA to detect modules from these networks. Subsequently, we perform network topological analysis and gene set enrichment analysis. Finally, the key genes of specific modules for each stage are screened as candidate disease genes. We obtain seven stage-specific modules, and identify 20, 12, and 22 key genes for three stages, respectively. Furthermore, 55%, 83%, and 64% of the genes are associated with breast cancer, for example <i>E2F2</i>, <i>E2F8</i>, <i>TPX2</i>, <i>BUB1</i>, and <i>CKAP2L</i>.

However, to date, there are no effective biological therapies against breast cancers that lack these three receptors or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). TNBC correlates with poor survival, in part because they relapse following chemo- and radio-therapies. TNBC is intrinsically aggressive since they have high mitotic indexes and tend to metastasize to the central nervous system. TNBCs are more likely to display centrosome amplification, an abnormal phenotype that results in defective mitotic spindles and abnormal cytokinesis, which culminate in aneuploidy and chromosome instability (known causes of tumor initiation and chemo-resistance). Besides their known role in cell cycle control, mitotic kinases have been also studied in different types of cancer including breast, especially in the context of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is a cellular process characterized by the loss of cell polarity, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and signaling reprogramming (upregulation of mesenchymal genes and downregulation of epithelial genes). Previously, we and others have shown the effects of mitotic kinases like Nek2 and Mps1 (TTK) on EMT. In this review, we focus on Aurora A, Aurora B, Bub1, and highly expressed in cancer (Hec1) as novel targets for therapeutic interventions in breast cancer and their effects on EMT. We highlight the established relationships and interactions of these and other mitotic kinases, clinical trial studies involving mitotic kinases, and the importance that represents to develop drugs against these proteins as potential targets in the primary care therapy for TNBC.",2021,Aurora kinases; Bub1; Centrosome/mitotic kinases; Hec1; breast cancer; epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; Humans; Mitosis; Protein Kinases,8

This study aimed to unveil profiles of mutant proteins expressed in lung adenocarcinomas of 36 patients harboring representative driver <i>EGFR</i> mutations (Ex19del, nine; L858R, nine; no Ex19del/L858R, 18). Surprisingly, the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis performed for identified mutant proteins demonstrated the profound differences in distance among the different <i>EGFR</i> mutation groups, suggesting that cancer cells harboring L858R or Ex19del emerge from cellular origins different from L858R/Ex19del-negative cells. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis, together with over-representative analysis, identified 18 coexpressed modules and their eigen proteins. Pathways enriched differentially for both the L858R and Ex19del mutations included carboxylic acid metabolic process, cell cycle, developmental biology, cellular responses to stress, mitotic prophase, cell proliferation, growth, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and immune system. The IPA causal network analysis identified the highly activated networks of <i>PARPBP, HOXA1</i>, and <i>APH1</i> under the L858R mutation, whereas those of <i>ASGR1, APEX1, BUB1</i>, and <i>MAPK10</i> were highly activated under the Ex19del mutation. Interestingly, the downregulated causal network of osimertinib intervention showed the highest significance in overlap <i>p</i>-value among most causal networks predicted under the L858R mutation. We also identified the causal network of MAPK interacting serine/threonine kinase 1/2 (<i>MNK1/2</i>) highly activated differentially under the L858R mutation. Tumor-suppressor <i>AMOT</i>, a component of the Hippo pathways, was highly inhibited commonly under both L858R and Ex19del mutations.

Ovarian cancer is frequently sensitive to chemotherapy at diagnosis but rapid development of drug resistance leads to disease progression and ultimately death in the majority of patients. We have generated paclitaxel resistant ovarian cell lines from their corresponding native cell lines to determine driver mechanisms of drug resistance using gene expression arrays. These paclitaxel resistant ovarian cells demonstrate: (1) Increased IC<sub>50</sub> for paclitaxel and docetaxel (10 to 75-fold) and cross-resistance to anthracyclines (2) Reduced cell apoptosis in the presence of paclitaxel (3) Gene depletion involving mitotic regulators BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase, cyclin BI (CCNB1), centromere protein E (CENPE), and centromere protein F (CENPF), and (4) Functional data validating gene depletion among mitotic regulators.

27552964,BUB1,10.1038/ejhg.2016.97,Chromosomal abnormalities in hepatic cysts point to novel polycystic liver disease genes.,"Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD) is caused by variants in PRKCSH, SEC63, and LRP5, whereas autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is caused by variants in PKD1 and PKD2. Liver cyst development in these disorders is explained by somatic loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type allele in the developing cyst. We hypothesize that we can use this mechanism to identify novel disease genes that reside in LOH regions. In this study, we aim to map abnormal genomic regions using high-density SNP microarrays to find novel PLD genes. We collected 46 cysts from 23 patients with polycystic or sporadic hepatic cysts, and analyzed DNA from those cysts using high-resolution microarray (n=24) or Sanger sequencing (n=22). We here focused on regions of homozygosity on the autosomes (&gt;3.0&#x2009;Mb) and large CNVs (&gt;1.0&#x2009;Mb). We found frequent LOH in PRKCSH (22/29) and PKD1/PKD2 (2/3) cysts of patients with known heterozygous germline variants in the respective genes. In the total cohort, 12/23 patients harbored abnormalities outside of familiar areas. In individual ADPLD cases, we identified germline events: a 2q13 complex rearrangement resulting in BUB1 haploinsufficiency, a 47XXX karyotype, chromosome 9q copy-number loss, and LOH on chromosome 3p. The latter region was overlapping with an LOH region identified in two other cysts. Unique germline and somatic abnormalities occur frequently in and outside of known genes underlying cysts.

In this study, we elucidated the molecular diversity among these subtypes by investigating large-scale sequencing datasets. Among genes upregulated from normal, ADC, SQC, LCC to SCLC, six hub genes were found closely correlated with adverse clinical outcome and were testified on cellular or tissue level with quantitative RT-PCR. Cox regression model was then built to generate a risk signature. The possible linkages among these genes were also explored. Transcript levels of BUB1, E2F1, ESPL1, GTSE1, RAB3B, and U2AF2 were found significantly elevated from normal, ADC, SQC, LCC to SCLC. Overexpression of one or multiple of these genes was correlated with adverse overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) in the whole patient cohort or groups stratified according to clinical variables, while most of all six genes were independent prognostic factors. When used as a six-gene risk signature, patients with high signature score displayed more unfavorable clinical variables and poorer outcome. Tight regulative relationships were found within these genes, while BUB1 and E2F1 were likely to be the drivers. We considered the augmented malignancy from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to SCLC might be due to the elevation of these six genes.

26312894,BUB1,10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60387-7,The role of BUB and CDC proteins in low-grade breast cancers.,"The drivers of neoplasia within low-grade luminal breast cancers remain undelineated. The BUB and CDC family are among kinase genes known recently to help to identify luminal breast cancers with poorer prognosis. Additionally, other CDC kinase genes (CDC42) are associated with luminal A breast cancers with good prognosis. We aimed to investigate the role of these kinases at the protein level within low-grade luminal breast cancers. The Nottingham Tenovus Primary Breast Cancer Series (n=1858) microarrays were immunostained for BUB (BUB1, BUB1B, BUB3) and CDC proteins (CDC2, CDC42) and expression correlated with clinicopathological and molecular variables and patient outcome (SPSS, version 22). On &#x3c7;(2) analysis, cytoplasmic BUB1 and nuclear BUB3 were negatively associated with grade including pleomorphism, mitosis, and Nottingham Prognostic Index, whereas BUB1B was positively associated (p=0&#xb7;05). BUB1 and BUB3 expression was positively correlated with oestrogen and progesterone receptor expression whereas BUB1B was negatively correlated (p=0&#xb7;01). CDC42 had strong associations with tumour morphology within the low-grade luminal breast cancers, tubular and lobular (p=0&#xb7;02). CDC42 nuclear expression revealed negative correlations with basal (CK5) and HER family biomarkers (p=0&#xb7;02). By contrast, cytoplasmic CDC2 overexpression was associated with high-grade tumours (p=0&#xb7;01). BUB1, BUB1B, and CDC42 showed significant associations (p=0&#xb7;04) with breast-cancer-specific survival even at the 15-20-year range, indicating their long-term prognostic potential. These results suggest that BUB1, BUB3, and CDC42 are key kinases for low-grade luminal tumours whereas BUB1B and CDC2 kinases are preferentially expressed in high-grade disease.

We identified genes that are regulated during the estrous cycle in murine ovarian surface epithelium and analysed these profiles to identify genes dysregulated in human ovarian cancer, using publically available datasets. We identified 338 genes that are regulated in murine ovarian surface epithelium during the estrous cycle and dysregulated in ovarian cancer. Six of seven candidates selected for immunohistochemical validation were expressed in serous ovarian cancer, inclusion cysts, ovarian surface epithelium and in fallopian tube epithelium. Most were overexpressed in ovarian cancer compared with ovarian surface epithelium and/or inclusion cysts (EpCAM, EZH2, BIRC5) although BIRC5 and EZH2 were expressed as highly in fallopian tube epithelium as in ovarian cancer. We prioritised the 338 genes for those likely to be important for ovarian cancer development by in silico analyses of copy number aberration and mutation using publically available datasets and identified genes with established roles in ovarian cancer as well as novel genes for which we have evidence for involvement in ovarian cancer. Chromosome segregation emerged as an important process in which genes from our list of 338 were over-represented including two (BUB1, NCAPD2) for which there is evidence of amplification and mutation. NUAK2, upregulated in ovarian surface epithelium in proestrus and predicted to have a driver mutation in ovarian cancer, was examined in a larger cohort of serous ovarian cancer where patients with lower NUAK2 expression had shorter overall survival. In conclusion, defining genes that are activated in normal epithelium in the course of ovulation that are also dysregulated in cancer has identified a number of pathways and novel candidate genes that may contribute to the development of ovarian cancer.",2011,"Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Animals; Cohort Studies; Epithelium; Estrous Cycle; Female; Gene Dosage; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, Neoplasm; Genetic Association Studies; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Mice; Middle Aged; Mutation; Neoplasm Proteins; Ovarian Neoplasms; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Reproducibility of Results",8

Most patients with SCLC who initially respond to chemotherapy develop disease relapse. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify novel driver mechanisms of SCLC progression to unlock treatment strategies to improve patient prognosis. SCLC cells comprise subsets of cells possessing progenitor or stem cell properties, while the underlying regulatory pathways remain elusive. Here, we identified the isoform 1 of the neurogenesis-associated protein ASPM (ASPM-I1) as a prominently upregulated stemness-associated gene during the self-renewal of SCLC cells. The expression of ASPM-I1 was found to be upregulated in SCLC cells and tissues, correlated with poor patient prognosis, and indispensable for SCLC stemness and tumorigenesis. A reporter array screening identified multiple developmental signaling pathways, including Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt pathways, whose activity in SCLC cells depended upon ASPM-I1 expression. Mechanistically, ASPM-I1 stabilized the Hh transcriptional factor GLI1 at the protein level through a unique exon-18-encoded region by competing with the E3 ligases &#x3b2;-TrCP and CUL3. In parallel, ASPM-I1 sustains the transcription of the Hh pathway transmembrane regulator SMO through the Wnt-DVL3-&#x3b2;-catenin signaling axis. Functional studies verified that the ASPM-I1-regulated Hh and Wnt activities significantly contributed to SCLC aggressiveness in vivo. Consistently, the expression of ASPM-I1 positively correlated with GLI1 and stemness markers in SCLC tissues. This study illuminates an ASPM-I1-mediated regulatory module that drives tumor stemness and progression in SCLC, providing an exploitable diagnostic and therapeutic target. ASPM promotes SCLC stemness and aggressiveness by stabilizing the expression of GLI1, DVL3, and SMO, representing a novel regulatory hub of Hh and Wnt signaling and targetable vulnerability.",2023,"Humans; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Small Cell Lung Carcinoma; Hedgehog Proteins; Zinc Finger Protein GLI1; Cell Line, Tumor; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Lung Neoplasms; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic",3

Identifying the driver pathways in GC progression is crucial to improving the clinical outcome. Recent studies identified ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated) and FOXM1 (Forkhead box protein M1) as novel Wnt and cancer stem cell (CSC) regulators; their pathogenetic roles and potential crosstalks in GC remain unclarified. The expression patterns of ASPM isoforms and FOXM1 were profiled in normal gastric epithelial and GC tissues. The functional roles of ASPM and FOXM1 in Wnt activity, cancer stemness and GC progression, and the underlying signaling processes were investigated. Approximately one third of GC cells upregulate the expression of ASPM isoform I (ASPMiI) in their cytoplasm; the tumors with a high ASPMiI positive score (&#x2265;&#x2009;10%) are associated with a poor prognosis of the patients. Mechanistically, the molecular interplay among FOXM1, ASPMiI and DVL3 was found to converge on &#x3b2;-catenin to control the Wnt activity and the stemness property of GC cells. This multi-mode Wnt-regulatory module serves to reinforce Wnt signals in CSCs by transcriptional regulation (FOXM1-ASPM), protein-protein interactions (ASPMiI-DVL3-&#x3b2;-catenin), and nuclear translocation (FOXM1-&#x3b2;-catenin).

Drivers of microcephaly could be attractive brain tumor targets.,"New targets for brain tumor therapies may be identified by mutations that cause hereditary microcephaly. Brain growth depends on the repeated proliferation of stem and progenitor cells. Microcephaly syndromes result from mutations that specifically impair the ability of brain progenitor or stem cells to proliferate, by inducing either premature differentiation or apoptosis. Brain tumors that derive from brain progenitor or stem cells may share many of the specific requirements of their cells of origin. These tumors may therefore be susceptible to disruptions of the protein products of genes that are mutated in microcephaly. The potential for the products of microcephaly genes to be therapeutic targets in brain tumors are highlighted hereby reviewing research on EG5, KIF14, ASPM, CDK6, and ATR.

Clustering extra centrosomes is a major coping mechanism required for faithful mitosis of cancer cells with CA that would otherwise undergo mitotic catastrophe and cell death. However, its underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully described. Furthermore, little is known about the processes and players triggering aggressiveness of cells with CA beyond mitosis. Here, we identified Transforming Acidic Coiled-Coil Containing Protein 3 (TACC3) to be overexpressed in tumors with CA, and its high expression is associated with dramatically worse clinical outcome. We demonstrated, for the first time, that TACC3 forms distinct functional interactomes regulating different processes in mitosis and interphase to ensure proliferation and survival of cancer cells with CA. Mitotic TACC3 interacts with the Kinesin Family Member C1 (KIFC1) to cluster extra centrosomes for mitotic progression, and inhibition of this interaction leads to mitotic cell death via multipolar spindle formation. Interphase TACC3 interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex (HDAC2 and MBD2) in nucleus to inhibit the expression of key tumor suppressors (e.g., p21, p16 and APAF1) driving G1/S progression, and its inhibition blocks these interactions and causes p53-independent G1 arrest and apoptosis. Notably, inducing CA by p53 loss/mutation increases the expression of TACC3 and KIFC1 via FOXM1 and renders cancer cells highly sensitive to TACC3 inhibition. Targeting TACC3 by guide RNAs or small molecule inhibitors strongly inhibits growth of organoids and breast cancer cell line- and patient-derived xenografts with CA by induction of multipolar spindles, mitotic and G1 arrest. Altogether, our results show that TACC3 is a multifunctional driver of highly aggressive breast tumors with CA and that targeting TACC3 is a promising approach to tackle this disease.",2023,"Humans; Female; Spindle Apparatus; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Breast Neoplasms; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Centrosome; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA-Binding Proteins",5

We test functional dependence on each of these genes using RNAi in breast cancer and non-malignant cells, validating malignant cell selective dependence upon 37 of 130 genes. Further analysis reveals a cluster of 13 TNBC addiction genes frequently co-upregulated that includes genes regulating cell cycle checkpoints, DNA damage response, and malignant cell selective mitotic genes.

Although KIFC1 acts as a crucial role in the development of several human cancers, the KIFC1 expression profile and functional remain unclear in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We collected the fresh NSCLC samples and paired normal lung tissue in patients with lung cancer operation, and detected KIFC1 expression using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. To expand on previous smaller-scale studies, NSCLC tissue microarrays (TMA) were analyzed by IHC. Finally, cell lines were employed to further probe the potential mechanisms. In this study, we described that KIFC1 was significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues compared with the corresponding normal tissues. Moreover, KIFC1 overexpression was associated with the poor overall survival (OS) of NSCLC patients, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of KIFC1 significantly suppressed tumor cell proliferation <i>in vitro</i>. Further verification showed that inhibition of KIFC1 gene expression caused the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinases inhibitor p21 and downregulation of the cell cycle driver protein cdc2, which arrested cells in the G2-M phase. we report that increased KIFC1 expression may promote cell proliferation and identified it as a biomarker of unfavorable prognosis in NSCLC patients.",2020,Kinesin family member C1 (KIFC1); cell division cycle protein 2 homolog (cdc2); cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21); non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); prognostic,5
23895133,KIFC1,10.1021/cb400186w,Discovery and mechanistic study of a small molecule inhibitor for motor protein KIFC1.,"Centrosome amplification is observed in many human cancers and has been proposed to be a driver of both genetic instability and tumorigenesis. Cancer cells have evolved mechanisms to bundle multiple centrosomes into two spindle poles to avoid multipolar mitosis that can lead to chromosomal segregation defects and eventually cell death. KIFC1, a kinesin-14 family protein, plays an essential role in centrosomal bundling in cancer cells, but its function is not required for normal diploid cell division, suggesting that KIFC1 is an attractive therapeutic target for human cancers. To this end, we have identified the first reported small molecule inhibitor AZ82 for KIFC1. AZ82 bound specifically to the KIFC1/microtubule (MT) binary complex and inhibited the MT-stimulated KIFC1 enzymatic activity in an ATP-competitive and MT-noncompetitive manner with a Ki of 0.043 &#x3bc;M. AZ82 effectively engaged with the minus end-directed KIFC1 motor inside cells to reverse the monopolar spindle phenotype induced by the inhibition of the plus end-directed kinesin Eg5. Treatment with AZ82 caused centrosome declustering in BT-549 breast cancer cells with amplified centrosomes. Consistent with genetic studies, our data confirmed that KIFC1 inhibition by a small molecule holds promise for targeting cancer cells with amplified centrosomes and provided evidence that functional suppression of KIFC1 by inhibiting its enzymatic activity could be an effective means for developing cancer therapeutics.",2015,"Alanine; Drug Discovery; Enzyme Activation; Enzyme Inhibitors; HeLa Cells; Humans; Kinesins; Models, Molecular; Pyridines; Small Molecule Libraries",5
22946058,KIFC1,10.1242/jcs.107474,Acentrosomal spindle organization renders cancer cells dependent on the kinesin HSET.,"Centrosomes represent the major microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) of animal somatic cells and orchestrate bipolar spindle assembly during mitotic cell division. In meiotic cells, the kinesin HSET compensates for the lack of centrosomes by focusing acentrosomal MTOCs into two spindle poles. By clustering multiple centrosomes into two spindle poles, HSET also mediates bipolar mitosis in cancer cells with supernumerary centrosomes. However, although dispensable in non-transformed human cells, the role of HSET in cancer cells with two centrosomes has remained elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that HSET is required for proper spindle assembly, stable pole-focusing and survival of cancer cells irrespective of normal or supernumerary centrosome number. Strikingly, we detected pronounced acentrosomal MTOC structures in untreated mitotic cancer cells. While in most cancer cells these acentrosomal MTOCs were rapidly incorporated into the assembling bipolar spindle, some cells eventually established bipolar spindles with acentrosomal poles and free centrosomes. These observations demonstrate that acentrosomal MTOCs were functional and that both centrosomal and acentrosomal mechanisms were required for bipolar spindle organization. Our study shows that HSET is critical for clustering acentrosomal and centrosomal MTOCs during spindle formation in human cancer cells with two bona fide centrosomes. Furthermore, we show that in checkpoint-defective cancer cells, acentrosomal spindle formation and HSET-dependence are partially mediated by a constitutive activation of the DNA damage response. In summary, we propose that acentrosomal spindle assembly mechanisms are hyperactive in cancer cells and promote HSET, a key driver of acentrosomal spindle organization, as an attractive target for cancer therapy.",2013,"Cell Line, Tumor; Centrosome; DNA Damage; Humans; Kinesins; Microtubules; Multiprotein Complexes; Neoplasms; Spindle Apparatus",5

Multilevel-omics in 38 matched pairs of initial and relapsed T-ALL revealed 18 (47%) type-1 (defined by being derived from the major ancestral clone) and 20 (53%) type-2 relapses (derived from a minor ancestral clone). In both types of relapse, we observed known and novel drivers of multidrug resistance including MDR1 and MVP, NT5C2 and JAK-STAT activators. Patients with type-1 relapses were specifically characterized by IL7R upregulation. In remarkable contrast, type-2 relapses demonstrated (1) enrichment of constitutional cancer predisposition gene mutations, (2) divergent genetic and epigenetic remodeling, and (3) enrichment of somatic hypermutator phenotypes, related to BLM, BUB1B/PMS2 and TP53 mutations. T-ALLs that later progressed to type-2 relapses exhibited a complex subclonal architecture, unexpectedly, already at the time of initial diagnosis. Deconvolution analysis of ATAC-Seq profiles showed that T-ALLs later developing into type-1 relapses resembled a predominant immature thymic T-cell population, whereas T-ALLs developing into type-2 relapses resembled a mixture of normal T-cell precursors. In sum, our analyses revealed fundamentally different mechanisms driving either type-1 or type-2 T-ALL relapse and indicate that differential capacities of disease evolution are already inherent to the molecular setup of the initial leukemia.",2022,Child; Clonal Evolution; Humans; Mutation; Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Recurrence,5

In this work, we studied the genetic profile of well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs) in a cohort of Caucasian patients and analysed the signalling pathways and candidate genes potentially associated with the development of this oncological disease. Twenty-four formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples of well-differentiated PanNETs were subjected to massive parallel sequencing using the targeted gene panel (409 genes) of the Illumina NextSeq 550 platform (San Diego, USA). In 24 patients, 119 variants were identified in 54 genes. The median mutation rate per patient was 5 (2.8-7). The detected genetic changes were dominated by missense mutations (67%) and nonsense mutations (29%). 18% of the mutations were activating, 35% of the variants led to a loss of function of the encoded protein, and 52% were not classified. Twenty-six variants were described as new. Functionally significant changes in the tertiary structure and activity of the protein molecules in an in silico assay were predicted for 5 new genetic variants. The 5 highest priority candidate genes were selected: CREB1, TCF12, PRKAR1A, BCL11A, and BUB1B. Genes carrying the identified mutations participate in signalling pathways known to be involved in PanNETs; in addition, 38% of the cases showed genetic changes in the regulation of the SMAD2/3 signalling pathway.

No model is available to precisely elucidate the molecular drivers of this tumor type. HNF1B is a master regulator of gene expression. Here, we report that the transcription factor HNF1B is downregulated in the majority of ChRCC and that the magnitude of <i>HNF1B</i> loss is unique to ChRCC. We also observed a strong correlation between reduced <i>HNF1B</i> expression and aneuploidy in ChRCC patients. In murine embryonic fibroblasts or ACHN cells, <i>HNF1B</i> deficiency reduced expression of the spindle checkpoint proteins MAD2L1 and BUB1B, and the cell-cycle checkpoint proteins RB1 and p27. Furthermore, it altered the chromatin accessibility of <i>Mad2l1</i>, <i>Bub1b</i>, and <i>Rb1</i> genes and triggered aneuploidy development. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database revealed <i>TP53</i> mutations in 33% of ChRCC where <i>HNF1B</i> expression was repressed.

The BUB and CDC family are among kinase genes known recently to help to identify luminal breast cancers with poorer prognosis. Additionally, other CDC kinase genes (CDC42) are associated with luminal A breast cancers with good prognosis. We aimed to investigate the role of these kinases at the protein level within low-grade luminal breast cancers. The Nottingham Tenovus Primary Breast Cancer Series (n=1858) microarrays were immunostained for BUB (BUB1, BUB1B, BUB3) and CDC proteins (CDC2, CDC42) and expression correlated with clinicopathological and molecular variables and patient outcome (SPSS, version 22). On &#x3c7;(2) analysis, cytoplasmic BUB1 and nuclear BUB3 were negatively associated with grade including pleomorphism, mitosis, and Nottingham Prognostic Index, whereas BUB1B was positively associated (p=0&#xb7;05). BUB1 and BUB3 expression was positively correlated with oestrogen and progesterone receptor expression whereas BUB1B was negatively correlated (p=0&#xb7;01). CDC42 had strong associations with tumour morphology within the low-grade luminal breast cancers, tubular and lobular (p=0&#xb7;02).

BUB1, BUB1B, and CDC42 showed significant associations (p=0&#xb7;04) with breast-cancer-specific survival even at the 15-20-year range, indicating their long-term prognostic potential. These results suggest that BUB1, BUB3, and CDC42 are key kinases for low-grade luminal tumours whereas BUB1B and CDC2 kinases are preferentially expressed in high-grade disease. High protein expression of BUB1, BUB3, and CDC42 in low-grade breast cancers was associated with longer overall survival whereas lower expression resulted in poorer outcome.

Here, we found that the oncoprotein Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) acts as a potential driver for tumor growth in TNBC and, surprisingly, through a proteomic screen, we identified USP7 as a major regulator of FOXM1 in TNBC cells. USP7 interacts with FOXM1 both in vitro and in vivo. USP7 stabilizes FOXM1 through deubiquitination. Conversely, RNAi-mediated USP7 knockdown in TNBC cells, dramatically reduced the levels of FOXM1. Moreover, based upon the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology, we generated PU7-1 (protein degrader for USP7-1), as a USP7 specific degrader. PU7-1 induces rapid USP7 degradation at low nanomolar concentrations in cells but shows no obvious effect on other USP family proteins. Strikingly, the treatment of TNBC cells with PU7-1 significantly abrogates FOXM1 functions and effectively suppresses cell growth in vitro. By using xenograft mouse models, we found that PU7-1 markedly represses tumor growth in vivo. Notably, ectopic overexpression of FOXM1 can reverse the tumor growth suppressive effects induced by PU7-1, underscored the specific effect on FOXM1 induced by USP7 inactivation. Together, our findings indicate that FOXM1 is a major target of USP7 in modulating tumor growth in a p53-independent manner and reveals the USP7 degrader as a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancers.",2023,NA,71

In this study, we developed a novel combination strategy, ""antiADAM17 antibody A9(B8)&#x2009;+&#x2009;EGFR-TKIs"", to enhance the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs. The addition of A9(B8) was shown to restore the effectiveness of erlotinib and overcome acquired resistance. We found that when A9(B8) antibody was treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, the combination treatment synergistically increased apoptosis in an NSCLC cell line and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, the addition of A9(B8) could only reduce the survival of the erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cell line and inhibit the growth of erlotinib-resistant tumors in vivo but not gefitinib-resistant cells. Furthermore, we revealed that A9(B8) overcame erlotinib resistance through the FOXO3a/FOXM1 axis and arrested the cell cycle at the G<sub>1</sub>/S phase, resulting in the apoptosis of cancer cells. Hence, this study establishes a novel, promising strategy for overcoming acquired resistance to erlotinib through the FOXO3a/FOXM1 axis by arresting the cell cycle at the G<sub>1</sub>/S phase.",2022,"Antibody therapy; Cell death; Drug target; Precision oncology; Small molecule; Humans; Antibodies; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Drug Resistance; ErbB Receptors; Erlotinib Hydrochloride; Forkhead Box Protein M1; Gefitinib; Lung Neoplasms; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm",71

The molecular basis of early disease onset is still elusive. We recruited 472 female breast cancer from two sub-Saharan African countries (Cameroon and Congo) between 2007 and 2018 and collected clinical data from these patients. To investigate the molecular drivers of early disease onset, we analyzed publicly available breast cancer molecular data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and the gene expression omnibus (GEO) for copy number alteration, mutation and gene expression. Early BC onset (EOBRCA) (diagnosis before 45&#xa0;years) was higher in African women compared with the TCGA cohort (51.7% vs 15.6%). The tumor grade, mitotic index, HER2&#x2009;+&#x2009;phenotype, basal-like phenotype and ki67 were higher in EOBRCA for all cohorts. BC risk factors such as parity, breastfeeding early onset of menarche and use of hormonal contraceptives were significantly associated with EOBRCA (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). EOBRCA was equally associated with copy number alterations in several oncogenes including CDH6 and FOXM1 and tumor suppressor including TGM3 and DMBT1 as well as higher TP53 mutation rates (OR: 2.93, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). There was a significant enrichment of TGF&#xdf; signaling in EOBRCA with TGM3 deletions, which was associated with high expression of all SMAD transcription factors as well as WNT ligands. The Frizzled receptors FZD1, FZD4 and FZD6 were significantly upregulated in EOBRCA, suggesting activation of non-canonical WNT signaling. Our data, suggest the implication of TGM3 deletion in early breast cancer onset.

Alternative meningioma grouping schemes using copy number variants, gene expression profiles, somatic short variants, or integrated molecular models have been proposed. These data suggest meningioma DNA methylation groups may harbor subgroups unifying contrasting theories of meningioma biology. A total of 565 meningioma DNA methylation profiles from patients with comprehensive clinical follow-up at independent discovery (n = 200) or validation (n = 365) institutions were reanalyzed and classified into Merlin-intact, Immune-enriched, or Hypermitotic DNA methylation groups. RNA sequencing from the discovery (n = 200) or validation (n = 302) cohort were analyzed in the context of DNA methylation groups to identify subgroups. Biological features and clinical outcomes were analyzed across meningioma grouping schemes. RNA sequencing revealed differential enrichment of FOXM1 target genes across two subgroups of Hypermitotic meningiomas. Differential expression and ontology analyses showed the subgroup of Hypermitotic meningiomas without FOXM1 target gene enrichment was distinguished by gene expression programs driving macromolecular metabolism. Analysis of genetic, epigenetic, gene expression, or cellular features revealed Hypermitotic meningioma subgroups were concordant with Proliferative or Hypermetabolic meningiomas, which were previously reported alongside Merlin-intact and Immune-enriched tumors using an integrated molecular model. The addition of DNA methylation subgroups to clinical models refined the prediction of postoperative outcomes compared to the addition of DNA methylation groups. Meningiomas can be separated into three DNA methylation groups and Hypermitotic meningiomas can be subdivided into Proliferative and Hypermetabolic subgroups, each with distinct biological and clinical features.",2023,DNA methylation; cancer; central nervous system; meningioma; tumor; Humans; Meningioma; Meningeal Neoplasms; Neurofibromin 2; DNA Methylation; Transcriptome,71

FOXM1, a proliferation-associated transcription factor, is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors as a key driver of tumorigenesis and cancer progression, and is a potential anticancer therapeutic target. However, FOXM1-targeting p-PROTACs has not been researched. Here, we first analyzed the expression of FOXM1, GLUT1 and PD-L1 in liver cancer through database and clinical samples of patients. FOXM1-targeting peptides, selected by screening phage display library, are verified its targeting effect by immunofluorescence and CCK-8 test. The novel p-PROTAC degrader of FOXM1 is chemically synthesis, named FOXM1-PROTAC, by linking a FOXM1-binding antagonistic peptide, with the E3 ubiquitin ligase recruitment ligand Pomalidomide and with the cell membrane penetrating peptide TAT. Its degradation effect on FOXM1 was detected by Western blotting, qPCR, and we verified its effect on the behavior of cancer cells by flow cytometry, scratch assay, and Transwell in vitro. The tumor xenografted mice model was used for evaluating FOXM1-PROTAC therapeutic response in vivo. Finally, we detected the expression of GLUT1 and PD-L1 after FOXM1-PROTAC degraded FOXM1 by using Western Blotting and hippocampal detectors and dual immunofluorescence. We found that the novel FOXM1-PROTAC efficiently entered cells and induced degradation of FOXM1 protein, which strongly inhibits viability as well as migration and invasion in various cancer cell lines, and suppressed tumor growth in HepG2 and MDA-MB-231 cells xenograft mouse models, without detected toxicity in normal tissues. Meanwhile, FOXM1-PROTAC decreased the cancer cells glucose metabolism via downregulating the protein expression levels of glucose transporter GLUT1 and the immune checkpoint PD-L1, which suggests involvement of FOXM1 in cancer cell metabolism and immune regulation. Our results indicate that biologically targeted degradation of FOXM1 is an attractive therapeutic strategy, and antagonist peptide-containing FOXM1-PROTACs as both degrader and inhibitor of FOXM1 could be developed as a safe and promising drug for FOXM1-overexpressed cancer therapy.",2022,Breast cancer; FOXM1; GLUT1; Liver cancer; P-PROTACs; PD-L1; Animals; Humans; Mice; B7-H1 Antigen; Cell-Penetrating Peptides; Forkhead Box Protein M1; Glucose; Glucose Transporter Type 1; Ligands; Neoplasms; Proteolysis; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases,71
36119839,FOXM1,,USP39 facilitates breast cancer cell proliferation through stabilization of FOXM1.,"Deubiquitinating enzyme dysregulation has been linked to the development of a variety of human malignancies, including breast cancer. However, the exact involvement of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP39 in the progression of breast cancer is yet unknown. Cell viability and colony formation analysis was used to assess the effects of USP39 knockdown on breast cancer cells in this study. The interaction between USP39 and FOXM1 was investigated using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and in vitro deubiquitination analysis. The expression of USP39 and FOXM1 in breast cancer tissues was studied using the TCGA database. According to our findings, USP39 deubiquitinates and stabilizes FOXM1, promoting breast cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, elevated USP39 expression lowers FOXM1 ubiquitination, resulting in increased transcriptional activity. In addition, the high expression of USP39 reduces the ubiquitination of FOXM1, thereby enhancing the transcriptional activity of FOXM1 and regulating the expression of downstream genes Cdc25b and Plk1. USP39 is positively correlated with the expression level of FOXM1 in breast cancer cells. In general, our research revealed the USP39-FOXM1 axis as a critical driver of breast cancer cell proliferation and provided a theoretical foundation for targeting the USP39-FOXM1 axis for pancreatic cancer treatment.",2022,Breast cancer; cell proliferation; transcription factor FOXM1; ubiquitin-specific protease 39,71

Using primary human melanocytes representing the full human skin pigment continuum and preclinical melanoma models, we show that cell-intrinsic differences between dark and light melanocytes regulate melanocyte proliferative capacity and susceptibility to malignant transformation, independent of melanin and ultraviolet exposure. These differences result from dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), a melanin precursor synthesized at higher levels in melanocytes from darkly pigmented skin. We used both high-throughput pharmacologic and genetic in vivo CRISPR screens to determine that DOPA limits melanocyte and melanoma cell proliferation by inhibiting the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M<sub>1</sub> (CHRM1) signaling. Pharmacologic CHRM1 antagonism in melanoma leads to depletion of c-Myc and FOXM1, both of which are proliferation drivers associated with aggressive melanoma. In preclinical mouse melanoma models, pharmacologic inhibition of CHRM1 or FOXM1 inhibited tumor growth. CHRM1 and FOXM1 may be new therapeutic targets for melanoma.",2023,NA,71

Epigenetic factors include a large family of members and understanding their function in cancer has been a hot topic. LncRNAs are RNA molecules with no capacity in synthesis of proteins, and they have regulatory functions in cells. LncRNAs are localized in nucleus and cytoplasm, and their abnormal expression is related to development of tumor. This manuscript emphasizes on the role of lncRNA H19 in various cancers and its association with tumor hallmarks. The function of lncRNA H19 in most tumors is oncogenic and therefore, tumor cells increase its expression for promoting their progression. LncRNA H19 contributes to enhancing growth and cell cycle of cancers and by EMT induction, it is able to elevate metastasis rate. Silencing H19 induces apoptotic cell death and disrupts progression of tumors. LncRNA H19 triggers chemo- and radio-resistance in cancer cells. miRNAs are dually upregulated/down-regulated by lncRNA H19 in increasing tumor progression. Anti-cancer agents reduce lncRNA H19 in impairing tumor progression and increasing therapy sensitivity. A number of downstream targets and molecular pathways for lncRNA H19 have been detected in cancers including miRNAs, RUNX1, STAT3, &#x3b2;-catenin, Akt2 and FOXM1. Clinical studies have revealed potential of lncRNA H19 as biomarker and its association with poor prognosis.

Human Plant Homeodomain (PHD) finger protein 1 (PHF1) coordinates with H3K36me3 to increase nucleosomal DNA accessibility. Previous studies revealed that PHF1 is markedly upregulated in various tumors and enhances cell proliferation, migration and tumorigenesis. However, its roles in LUAD are still unknown. We aimed to depict the biological roles of PHF1 and identify useful targets for clinical treatment of LUAD. Based on the bioinformatic analysis, we found that PHF1 was down-regulated in LUAD samples and low PHF1 expressions correlated with unfavorable clinical characteristics. Patients with low PHF1 had poorer survival outcomes relative to those with high PHF1. Targeting PHF1 potentiated cell growth, migration and in vivo proliferation. Mechanistically, FTO mediated the stabilization of PHF1 mRNA by demethylating m6A, which particularly prevented YTHDF2 from degrading PHF1 transcripts. Of note, FTO also expressed lowly in LUAD that predicts poor prognosis of patients. FTO inhibition promoted LUAD progression, and PHF1 overexpression could reverse the effect. Lastly, down-regulated FTO/PHF1 axis could mainly elevate FOXM1 expression to potentiate the self-renewal capacity. Targeting FOXM1 was effective to suppress PHF1<sup>low/-</sup> LUAD growth. Collectively, our findings revealed that FTO positively regulates PHF1 expression and determined the tumor-suppressive role of FTO/PHF1 axis, thereby highlighting insights into its epigenetic remodeling mechanisms in LUAD progression and treatment.",2022,NA,71

Endowed with self-renewing abilities and multilineage differentiation potential, CSCs have emerged as cellular drivers of virtually all facets of tumor biology, including metastasis, tumor recurrence/relapse, and drug resistance. The functional and biological characteristics of CSCs, such as self-renewal, cell fate decisions, survival, proliferation, and differentiation are regulated by an array of extracellular factors, signaling pathways, and pluripotent transcriptional factors. Besides the well-characterized regulatory role of transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4, and MYC in CSCs, evidence for the central role of Forkhead box transcription factor FOXM1 in the establishment, maintenance, and functions of CSCs is accumulating. Conventionally identified as a master regulator of the cell cycle, a comprehensive understanding of this molecule has revealed its multifarious oncogenic potential and uncovered its role in angiogenesis, invasion, migration, self-renewal, and drug resistance. This review compiles the large body of literature that has accumulated in recent years that provides evidence for the mechanisms by which FOXM1 expression promotes stemness in glioblastoma, breast, colon, ovarian, lung, hepatic, and pancreatic carcinomas. We have also compiled the data showing the association of stem cell mediators with FOXM1 using TCGA mRNA expression data. Further, the prognostic importance of FOXM1 and other stem cell markers is presented. The delineation of FOXM1-mediated regulation of CSCs can aid in the development of molecularly targeted pharmacological approaches directed at the selective eradication of CSCs in several human malignancies.",2022,"Cancer stem cells; Carcinogenesis; FOXM1; Malignancies; Self-renewal; Signaling pathways; Humans; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Signal Transduction; Glioblastoma; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Forkhead Box Protein M1",71

Here we show that FOXM1 is a positive regulator of myeloma metabolism that greatly impacts the bioenergetic pathways of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Using FOXM1-deficient myeloma cells as principal experimental model system, we find that FOXM1 increases glucose uptake, lactate output, and oxygen consumption in myeloma. We demonstrate that the novel 1,1-diarylethylene small-compound FOXM1 inhibitor, NB73, suppresses myeloma in cell culture and human-in-mouse xenografts using a mechanism that includes enhanced proteasomal FOXM1 degradation. Consistent with the FOXM1-stabilizing chaperone function of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), the HSP90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, collaborates with NB73 in slowing down myeloma. These findings define FOXM1 as a key driver of myeloma metabolism and underscore the feasibility of targeting FOXM1 for new approaches to myeloma therapy and prevention.",2022,"Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Forkhead Box Protein M1; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glycolysis; Humans; Mice; Multiple Myeloma; Transcription Factors",71

CSCs share critical features with embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The pluripotent transcription factors (TFs) and developmental signaling pathways of ESCs are invariably hijacked by CSCs termed 'oncofetal drivers' in many cancers, which are rarely detectable in adult tissues. The unique expression pattern makes oncofetal proteins ideal therapeutic targets in cancer treatment. Therefore, elucidation of oncofetal drivers in cancers is critical for the development of effective CSCs-directed therapy. In this review, we summarize the common pluripotent TFs such as OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4, MYC, SALL4, and FOXM1, as well as the development signaling including Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin, Hedgehog (Hh), Hippo, Notch, and TGF-&#x3b2; pathways of ESCs and CSCs. We also describe the newly identified oncofetal proteins that drive the self-renewal, plasticity, and therapy-resistance of CSCs.

Ubiquitin-like protein FAT10 has recently been reported to promote tumor chemotherapy resistance. In this study, the expression of FAT10 in PC was significantly higher than that in adjacent noncancerous tissues. Increased expression of FAT10 in PC was related to a late TNM stage and decreased overall survival. Functional experiments revealed that downregulating the expression of FAT10 inhibits the proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PC cells, promotes the apoptosis of PC cells, and enhances sensitivity to gemcitabine chemotherapy. In addition, upregulation of FAT10 increased the expression of FOXM1 protein. The effect of downregulating FAT10 was reversed by FOXM1 overexpression, and FOXM1 knockdown inhibited EMT driven by FAT10 overexpression. Mechanistically, FAT10 stabilized the expression of FOXM1 by competing with ubiquitin to bind FOXM1 and inhibiting the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of FOXM1. In conclusion, the FAT10-FOXM1 axis is a pivotal driver of PC proliferation and gemcitabine resistance, and the results provide novel insights into chemotherapy resistance in PC.",2022,"Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Deoxycytidine; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Forkhead Box Protein M1; Humans; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Signal Transduction; Ubiquitins; Gemcitabine",71

The lncRNA ELDR (EGFR long noncoding downstream RNA) was recently shown to be highly expressed in oral cancers as compared to adjacent nontumor tissue, and we previously reported that ELDR may be an oncogene as inhibition of ELDR reduces tumor growth in oral cancer models. Furthermore, overexpression of ELDR induces proliferation and colony formation in normal oral keratinocytes (NOKs). In this study, we examined in further detail how ELDR drives the neoplastic transformation of normal keratinocytes. We performed RNA-seq analysis on NOKs stably expressing ELDR (NOK-ELDR), which revealed that ELDR enhances the expression of cell cycle-related genes. Expression of Aurora kinase A and its downstream targets Polo-like kinase 1, cell division cycle 25C, cyclin-dependent kinase 1, and cyclin B1 (CCNB1) are significantly increased in NOK-ELDR cells, suggesting induction of G2/M progression. We further identified CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) as a binding partner of ELDR in NOK-ELDR cells. We show that ELDR stabilizes CTCF and increases its expression. Finally, we demonstrate the ELDR-CTCF axis upregulates transcription factor Forkhead box M1, which induces Aurora kinase A expression and downstream G2/M transition.

Prevalence (~96%) of mutant p53 is a hallmark of HGSOC. Estrogen receptor-beta (ER&#x3b2;) has been reported to be another important player in HGSOC, although the pro-versus anti-tumorigenic role of its different isoforms remains unsettled. However, whether there is functional interaction between ER&#x3b2; and mutant p53 in HGSOC is unknown. ER&#x3b2;1 and ER&#x3b2;2 mRNA and protein analysis in HGSOC cell lines demonstrated that ER&#x3b2;2 is the predominant isoform in HGSOC. Specificity of ER&#x3b2;2 antibody was ascertained using cells depleted of ER&#x3b2;2 and ER&#x3b2;1 separately with isoform-specific siRNAs.

Mutational signatures show the anti-viral apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC) enzymes are responsible for the preponderance of mutations in bladder tumour genomes, but no causative viral agent has been identified. BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a common childhood infection that remains latent in the adult kidney, where reactivation leads to viruria. This study provides missing mechanistic evidence linking reactivated BKPyV-infection to bladder cancer risk. We used a mitotically-quiescent, functionally-differentiated model of normal human urothelium to examine BKPyV-infection. BKPyV-infection led to significantly elevated APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B protein, increased deaminase activity and greater numbers of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in the host urothelial genome. BKPyV Large T antigen (LT-Ag) stimulated re-entry from G0 into the cell cycle through inhibition of retinoblastoma protein and activation of EZH2, E2F1 and FOXM1, with cells arresting in G2. The single-stranded DNA displacement loops formed in urothelial cells during BKPyV-infection interacted with LT-Ag to provide a substrate for APOBEC3-activity.

In this study, we aimed to reveal the role of SPAG5 in melanoma and clarify whether FOXM1 (forkhead box protein M1) /ADAM17 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17) /NOTCH1 signaling was involved. The expression of SPAG5 in malignant melanoma (MM) tissues and matched normal tissues was detected using qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Cell viability was tested using CCK-8 (Cell Count Kit-8), colony formation and EdU staining. Cell migration and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) were measured using transwell chambers and immunofluorescent staining. Cell cycle distribution and tumorigenesis were assessed by flow cytometry and in vivo tumor-bearing experiments, respectively. The results demonstrated that the expression of SPAG5 was increased in MM tissues and cells. Downregulation of SPAG5 inhibited cell viability, migration, invasion and EMT, and induced a G1-phase arrest. In addition, downregulation of SPAG5 decreased the expression of FOXM1, thereafter inhibiting the expression of ADAM17, NOTCH1 and HES1. Furthermore, deletion of SPAG5 expression decreased the tumorigenesis of MM A375 cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that SPAG5 was overexpressed in MM.

FoxM1 overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma is reflective of tumor aggressiveness and recurrence, poor prognosis and low survival in patients. In our study, we have identified the antimalarial natural product, Artemisinin, to efficiently curb FoxM1 expression and activity in hepatic cancer cells, thereby exhibiting potential anticancer efficacy. Here, we demonstrated that Artemisinin considerably mitigates FoxM1 transcriptional activity by disrupting its interaction with the promoter region of its downstream targets, thereby suppressing the expression of numerous oncogenic drivers. Augmented level of FoxM1 is implicated in drug resistance of cancer cells, including hepatic tumor cells. Notably, FoxM1 overexpression rendered HCC cells poorly responsive to Artemisinin-mediated cytotoxicity while FoxM1 depletion in resistant liver cancer cells sensitized them to Artemisinin treatment, manifested in lower proliferative and growth index, drop in invasive potential and repressed expression of EMT markers with a concomitantly increased apoptosis. Moreover, Artemisinin, when used in combination with Thiostrepton, an established FoxM1 inhibitor, markedly reduced anchorage-independent growth and displayed more pronounced death in liver cancer cells. We found this effect to be evident even in the resistant HCC cells, thereby putting forth a novel combination therapy for resistant cancer patients. Altogether, our findings provide insight into the pivotal involvement of FoxM1 in the tumor suppressive activities of Artemisinin and shed light on the potential application of Artemisinin for improved therapeutic response, especially in resistant hepatic malignancies. Considering that Artemisinin compounds are in current clinical use with favorable safety profiles, the results from our study will potentiate its utility in juxtaposition with established FoxM1 inhibitors, promoting maximal therapeutic efficacy with minimal adverse effects in liver cancer patients.",2021,FOXM1 (Forkhead box M1); anticancer; anticarcinogenic agent; artemisinin (ART); drug resistance; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),71

The underlying pathologic molecular events remain poorly understood with a paucity of actionable genetic drivers, which hinders the development of new treatment strategies. We performed large-scale RNA sequencing analysis to identify chimerical transcripts preferentially expressed in luminal B breast cancer. The lead candidate was validated by reverse transcription PCR in breast cancer tissues. The effects of inducible ectopic expression or genetic silencing were assessed by phenotypic assays such as MTS, transwell, and transendothelial migration assays, and by clonogenic assays to assess MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Subcellular fractionation, Western blots, and immunoprecipitation were performed to characterize the protein products and elucidate the engaged mechanisms. Here we report a novel tumor-specific chimeric transcript <i>RAD51AP1-DYRK4</i> preferentially expressed in luminal B tumors. Analysis of 200 ER<sup>+</sup> breast tumors detected <i>RAD51AP1-DYRK4</i> overexpression in 19 tumors (9.5%), which is markedly enriched in the luminal B tumors (17.5%). Ectopic expression of <i>RAD51AP1-DYRK4</i>, but not wild-type <i>RAD51AP1</i>, leads to marked activation of MEK/ERK signaling, and endows increased cell motility and transendothelial migration. More importantly, RAD51AP1-DYRK4 appears to endow increased sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor trametinib through attenuating compensatory activation of HER2/PI3K/AKT under MEK inhibition. This discovery sheds light on a new area of molecular pathobiology of luminal B tumors and implies potential new therapeutic opportunities for more aggressive breast tumors overexpressing this fusion.",2022,"Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA-Binding Proteins; Datasets as Topic; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Pyridones; Pyrimidinones; RNA-Binding Proteins; RNA-Seq",2
28112719,RAD51AP1,10.1038/oncsis.2016.88,The role of the cancer stem cell marker CD271 in DNA damage response and drug resistance of melanoma cells.,"Several lines of evidence have suggested that stemness and acquired resistance to targeted inhibitors or chemotherapeutics are mechanistically linked. Here we observed high cell surface and total levels of nerve growth factor receptor/CD271, a marker of melanoma-initiating cells, in sub-populations of chemoresistant cell lines. CD271 expression was increased in drug-sensitive cells but not resistant cells in response to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics etoposide, fotemustine and cisplatin. Comparative analysis of melanoma cells engineered to stably express CD271 or a targeting short hairpin RNA by expression profiling provided numerous genes regulated in a CD271-dependent manner. In-depth analysis of CD271-responsive genes uncovered the association of CD271 with regulation of DNA repair components. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of CD271-responsive genes in drug-resistant cells, among them DNA repair components. Moreover, our comparative screen identified the fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13) as a target of CD271, highly expressed in chemoresistant cells. Further we show that levels of CD271 determine drug response. Knock-down of CD271 in fotemustine-resistant cells decreased expression of FGF13 and at least partly restored sensitivity to fotemustine. Together, we demonstrate that expression of CD271 is responsible for genes associated with DNA repair and drug response. Further, we identified 110 CD271-responsive genes predominantly expressed in melanoma metastases, among them were NEK2, TOP2A and RAD51AP1 as potential drivers of melanoma metastasis. In addition, we provide mechanistic insight in the regulation of CD271 in response to drugs. We found that CD271 is potentially regulated by p53 and in turn is needed for a proper p53-dependent response to DNA-damaging drugs. In summary, we provide for the first time insight in a CD271-associated signaling network connecting CD271 with DNA repair, drug response and metastasis.",2020,NA,2

However, the key molecular events and mechanisms mediating lymph node metastasis remain elusive. RNA sequencing was used to identify driver genes responsible for lymph node metastasis in four cases of gastric primary tumors, metastatic lesions of lymph nodes and matched normal gastric epithelial tissue. qRT-PCR and IHC were applied to examine RPRD1B expression. Metastatic functions were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RNA-seq was used to identify target genes. ChIP, EMSA and dual luciferase reporter assays were conducted to identify the binding sites of target genes. Co-IP, RIP, MeRIP, RNA-FISH and ubiquitin assays were applied to explore the underlying mechanisms. The top 8 target genes (RPRD1B, MAP4K4, MCM2, TOPBP1, FRMD8, KBTBD2, ADAM10 and CXCR4) that were significantly upregulated in metastatic lymph nodes of individuals with GC were screened. The transcriptional cofactor RPRD1B (regulation of nuclear pre-mRNA domain containing 1B) was selected for further characterization. The clinical analysis showed that RPRD1B was significantly overexpressed in metastatic lymph nodes and associated with poor outcomes in patients with GC. The Mettl3-induced m<sup>6</sup>A modification was involved in the upregulation of RPRD1B. Functionally, RPRD1B promoted lymph node metastasis capabilities in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies indicated that RPRD1B increased fatty acid uptake and synthesis by transcriptionally upregulating c-Jun/c-Fos and activating the c-Jun/c-Fos/SREBP1 axis. In addition, NEAT1 was upregulated significantly by c-Jun/c-Fos in RPRD1B-overexpressing cells. NEAT1, in turn, increased the stability of the RPRD1B mRNA by recruiting the m<sup>6</sup>A ""reader"" protein hnRNPA2B1 and reduced the degradation of the RPRD1B protein by inhibiting TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination. Notably, this functional circuitry was disrupted by an inhibitor of c-Jun/c-Fos/AP1 proteins (SR11302) and small interfering RNAs targeting NEAT1, leading to a preferential impairment of lymph node metastasis. Based on these findings, RPRD1B facilitated FA metabolism and assisted primary tumor implantation in lymph nodes via the c-Jun/c-Fos/SREBP1 axis, which was enhanced by a NEAT1-mediated positive feedback loop, serving as a potential therapeutic target for GC treatment.",2022,"Fatty acid metabolism, c-Jun/c-Fos/SREBP1 axis; Lymph node metastasis; NEAT1; RPRD1B; TRIM25; hnRNPA2B1; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Fatty Acids; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Lymphatic Metastasis; Methyltransferases; Neoplasm Proteins; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; RNA Precursors; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Messenger; Stomach Neoplasms; Ubiquitins",9

We aimed to investigate molecular signatures based on miRNA and mRNA and perform an integrative analysis to identify molecular drivers and pathways for PeC development. Affymetrix miRNA microarray was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) comparing 11 tumoral tissues (TT) paired with non-neoplastic tissues (NNT) with further validation in an independent cohort (<i>n</i> = 13). We also investigated the mRNA expression of 83 genes in the total sample. Experimentally validated targets of DEmiRs, miRNA-mRNA networks, and enriched pathways were evaluated in silico. Eight out of 69 DEmiRs identified by microarray analysis were validated by qRT-PCR (miR-145-5p, miR-432-5p, miR-487b-3p, miR-30a-5p, miR-200a-5p, miR-224-5p, miR-31-3p and miR-31-5p). Furthermore, 37 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified when comparing TT and NNT. We identified four downregulated DEmiRs (miR-30a-5p, miR-432-5p, miR-487b-3p, and miR-145-5p) and six upregulated DEGs (<i>IL1A</i>, <i>MCM2</i>, <i>MMP1</i>, <i>MMP12</i>, <i>SFN</i> and <i>VEGFA</i>) as potential biomarkers in PeC by their capacity of discriminating TT and NNT with accuracy.

It is now clearly established that extensive epigenetic changes act as a driver in human tumors. This study exploits HCC epigenetic deregulation to define a novel prognostic model for monitoring the progression of HCC. We analyzed the genome-wide DNA methylation profile of 374 primary tumor specimens using the Illumina 450 K array data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We initially used a novel combination of Machine Learning algorithms (Recursive Features Selection, Boruta) to capture early tumor progression features. The subsets of probes obtained were used to train and validate Random Forest models to predict a Progression Free Survival greater or less than 6 months. The model based on 34 epigenetic probes showed the best performance, scoring 0.80 accuracy and 0.51 Matthews Correlation Coefficient on testset. Then, we generated and validated a progression signature based on 4 methylation probes capable of stratifying HCC patients at high and low risk of progression. Survival analysis showed that high risk patients are characterized by a poorer progression free survival compared to low risk patients. Moreover, decision curve analysis confirmed the strength of this predictive tool over conventional clinical parameters. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted that high risk patients differentiated themselves by the upregulation of proliferative pathways. Ultimately, we propose the oncogenic <i>MCM2</i> gene as a methylation-driven gene of which the representative epigenetic markers could serve both as predictive and prognostic markers. Briefly, our work provides several potential HCC progression epigenetic biomarkers as well as a new signature that may enhance patients surveillance and advances in personalized treatment.",2021,"epigenetic; hepatocellular carcinoma; hepatocellular carcinoma DNA methylation; prediction model; tumor microenvironment; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; CpG Islands; DNA; DNA Methylation; Decision Making; Disease Progression; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Liver Neoplasms; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Progression-Free Survival; Proportional Hazards Models; Regression Analysis; Risk; Tumor Microenvironment",9

Due to their physiological roles in the genome reduplication of normal cells, we hypothesised that the oncogenes cyclins E1 and E2 may be drivers of genome doubling in cancer. We show that both cyclin E1 (<i>CCNE1</i>) and cyclin E2 (<i>CCNE2</i>) mRNA are significantly associated with high genome ploidy in breast cancers. By live cell imaging and flow cytometry, we show that cyclin E2 overexpression promotes aberrant mitosis without causing mitotic slippage, and it increases ploidy with negative feedback on the replication licensing protein, Cdt1. We demonstrate that cyclin E2 localises with core preRC (pre-replication complex) proteins (MCM2, MCM7) on the chromatin of cancer cells. Low <i>CCNE2</i> is associated with improved overall survival in breast cancers, and we demonstrate that low cyclin E2 protects from excess genome rereplication. This occurs regardless of p53 status, consistent with the association of high cyclin E2 with genome doubling in both p53 null/mutant and p53 wildtype cancers. In contrast, while cyclin E1 can localise to the preRC, its downregulation does not prevent rereplication, and overexpression promotes polyploidy via mitotic slippage. Thus, in breast cancer, cyclin E2 has a strong association with genome doubling, and likely contributes to highly proliferative and genomically unstable breast cancers.",2020,cyclin E1; cyclin E2; genome doubling; genomic instability; p53,9

Routine methods for detecting TMMs in tumor samples are still missing, whereas telomerase targeting treatments are becoming available. In paediatric cancers, alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is found in a subset of sarcomas and malignant brain tumors. ALT is a non-canonical mechanism of telomere maintenance developed by cancer cells with no-functional telomerase. <i>Methods</i>: To identify drivers and/or markers of ALT, we performed a differential gene expression analysis between two zebrafish models of juvenile brain tumors, that differ only for the telomere maintenance mechanism adopted by tumor cells: one is ALT while the other is telomerase-dependent. <i>Results</i>: Comparative analysis of gene expression identified five genes of the pre-replicative complex, <i>ORC4, ORC6, MCM2</i>, <i>CDC45</i> and <i>RPA3</i> as upregulated in ALT. We searched for a correlation between telomerase levels and expression of the pre-replicative complex genes in a cohort of paediatric brain cancers and identified a counter-correlation between telomerase expression and the genes of the pre-replicative complex. Moreover, the analysis of ALT markers in a group of 20 patients confirmed the association between ALT and increased RPA and decreased H3K9<sub>me3</sub> localization at telomeres. <i>Conclusions</i>: Our study suggests that telomere maintenance mechanisms may act as a driver of telomeric DNA replication and chromatin status in brain cancers and identifies markers of ALT that could be exploited for precise prognostic and therapeutic purposes.",2020,ALT; C-circles; heterochromatin; pediatric brain tumors; pre-replicative complex; telomere maintenance mechanisms; zebrafish,9

We performed transcriptome on 16 primary coupled CRC and NTC tissues. We identified pathways and networks related to pathophysiology of CRC and selected potential therapeutic targets. CRC cells have multiple ways to reprogram its transcriptome: a functional enrichment analysis in 285 genes, 25% mutated, showed that they control the major cellular processes known to promote tumorigenesis. Among the genes showing alternative splicing, cell cycle related genes were upregulated (CCND1, CDC25B, MCM2, MCM3), while genes involved in fatty acid metabolism (ACAAA2, ACADS, ACAT1, ACOX, CPT1A, HMGCS2) were downregulated. Overall 148 genes showed differential splicing identifying 17 new isoforms. Most of them are involved in the pathogenesis of CRC, although the functions of these variants remain unknown. We identified 2 in-frame fusion events, KRT19-KRT18 and EEF1A1-HSP90AB1, encoding for chemical proteins in two CRC patients. We draw a functional interactome map involving integrated multiple genomic features in CRC.

30787364,MCM2,10.1038/s41598-019-38878-z,Genetic characterization of thymoma.,"Thymoma represents the most common anterior mediastinal compartment neoplasm, originating from the epithelial cell population in the thymus. Various histological types of thymoma feature different clinical characteristics. Furthermore, thymoma is frequently associated with autoimmune disorders, esp. myasthenia gravis (MG). However, the underlying molecular tumourigenesis of thymoma remains largely unknown. The goal of our current study is to demonstrate the underlying genetic abberations in thymoma, so as to understand the possible cause of MG in thymoma patients. By using CapitalBio mRNA microarray analysis, we analyzed 31 cases of thymoma including 5 cases of type AB thymoma, 6 B1-type cases, 12 B2-type cases, 5 B2B3-type cases and 3 type-B3 cases. 6 cases of thymoma were not associated with myasthenia gravis, while 25 cases were with myasthenia gravis. By comparisons between thymoma and the paratumoral tissues, differentially expressed genes were identified preliminarily. Among them, 292 genes increased more than 2-fold, 2 genes more than 5-fold. On the other hand, 596 genes were decreased more than 2-fold, 6 genes more than 20-fold. Interestingly, among these genes upregulated more than 2-fold, 6 driver genes (FANCI, NCAPD3, NCAPG, OXCT1, EPHA1 and MCM2) were formerly reported as driver oncogenes. This microarray results were further confirmed through real-time PCR. 8 most dysregulated genes were verified: E2F2, EPHA1, CCL25 and MCM2 were upregulated; and IL6, FABP4, CD36 and MYOC were downregulated. Supervised clustering heat map analysis of 2-fold upregulated and 2-fold downregulated genes revealed 6 distinct clusters. Strikingly, we found that cluster 1 was composed of two type-B2 thymoma; and cluster 6 was three type-B2/B3 thymoma. KEGG database analysis revealed possible genetic mechanisms of thymoma and functional process. We further compared gene expression pattern between thymoma with and without MG, and found 5 genes were upregulated more than 2-fold, more than 30 genes were downregulated more than 2-fold. KEGG analysis revealed 2 important signaling pathways with more than 2-fold upregulated genes (TGF- beta signaling pathway and HTLV-I signaling pathway) as differially functioning between MG positive and negative thymomas. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed that CCL25 was upregulated; and MYC, GADD45B, TNFRSF12 downregulated in thymoma with MG. Our study thus provided important genetic information on thymoma. It shed light on the molecular bases for analyzing the functional process of thymoma and finding potential biomarkers for pathological categorizing and treatment.

The present study intended to identify the association between three severe types of gynecological cancer, specifically ovarian cancer, cervical cancer and endometrial cancer, and to identify the connective driver genes, microRNAs (miRNAs) and biological processes associated with these types of gynecological cancer. In the present study, individual driver genes for each type of cancer were identified using integrated analysis of multiple microarray data. Gene Ontology (GO) has been used widely in functional annotation and enrichment analysis. In the present study, GO enrichment analysis revealed a number of common biological processes involved in gynecological cancer, including 'cell cycle' and 'regulation of macromolecule metabolism'. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis is a resource for understanding the high&#x2011;level functions and utilities of a biological system from molecular&#x2011;level information. In the present study, the most common pathway was 'cell cycle'. A protein&#x2011;protein interaction network was constructed to identify a hub of connective genes, including minichromosome maintenance complex component 2 (MCM2), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), collagen type&#xa0;I&#xa0;&#x3b1;1 chain (COL1A1) and Jun proto&#x2011;oncogene AP&#x2011;1 transcription factor subunit (JUN). Survival analysis revealed that the expression of MCM2, MMP2, COL1A1 and JUN was associated with the prognosis of the aforementioned gynecological cancer types. By constructing an miRNA&#x2011;driver gene network, let&#x2011;7 targeted the majority of the driver genes.

Here, we investigated the expression of MCMs and their values in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MCMs were analyzed in 105 samples including normal livers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15), cirrhotic livers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40), HCC (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (Cohort 1). Significantly up-regulated MCMs were verified in 102 HCC and matched peritumoral livers using PCR (Cohort 2), and the correlations with clinical features and outcomes were determined. In addition, the focused MCMs were analyzed in parallel immunohistochemistry of 345 samples on spectrum of hepatocarcinogenesis (Cohort 3) and queried for the potential specific role in cell cycle. MCM2-7, MCM8 and MCM10 was significantly up-regulated in HCC in Cohort 1. In Cohort 2, overexpression of MCM2-7, MCM8 and MCM10 was verified and significantly correlated with each other. Elevated MCM2, MCM6 and MCM7 were associated with adverse tumor features and poorer outcomes.

Additionally, MCM6 other than MCM2 and MCM7 independently predicted poorer survival in 175 HCC patients. Furthermore, knockdown of MCM6 caused a delay in S/G2-phase progression as evidenced by down-regulation of CDK2, CDK4, CyclinA, CyclinB1, CyclinD1, and CyclinE in HCC cells.

Attenuating MPHOSPH1 expression with a tumor-selective shRNA-expressing adenovirus (Ad-shMPP1) was sufficient to arrest HCC cell proliferation in a manner associated with an accumulation of multinucleated polyploid cells, induction of postmitotic apoptosis, and increased sensitivity to taxol cytotoxicity. Mechanistic investigations showed that attenuation of MPHOSPH1 stabilized p53, blocked STAT3 phosphorylation, and prolonged mitotic arrest. In a mouse subcutaneous xenograft model of HCC, tumoral injection of Ad-shMPP1 inhibited MPHOSPH1 expression and tumor growth in a manner correlated with induction of apoptosis. Combining Ad-shMPP1 injection with taxol administration enhanced antitumor efficacy relative to taxol alone. Furthermore, Ad-shMPP1 tail vein injection suppressed formation of orthotopic liver nodules and prevented hepatic dysfunction.

We have previously described a novel pathway in breast cancer cells, whereby ADP (Adenosine diphosphate)-ribose derived from hydrolysis of poly (ADP-Ribose) and pyrophosphate (PPi) are converted to ATP, catalysed by the enzyme NUDT5 (nucleotide diphosphate hydrolase type 5). Overexpression of the <i>NUDT5</i> gene in breast and other cancer types is associated with poor prognosis, increased risk of recurrence and metastasis. In order to understand the role of NUDT5 in cancer cell growth, we performed phenotypic and global expression analysis in breast cancer cells grown as oncospheres. Comparison of two-dimensional (2D) versus 3D cancer cell cultures from different tissues of origin suggest that NUDT5 increases the aggressiveness of the disease via the modulation of several key driver genes, including ubiquitin specific peptidase 22 (<i>USP22</i>), <i>RAB35B</i>, focadhesin (<i>FOCAD</i>) and prostagladin E synthase (<i>PTGES</i>). NUDT5 functions as a master regulator of key oncogenic pathways and of genes involved in cell adhesion, cancer stem cell (CSC) maintenance and epithelial to mesenchyme transition (EMT).

This information is vitally important in Taiwan, where endometrial cancer is the second most common gynecological cancer. We performed whole-exome sequencing on DNA from 14 tumor tissue samples from Taiwanese endometrial cancer patients. We used the Genome Analysis Tool kit software package for data analysis, and the dbSNP, Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases for comparisons. Variants were validated via Sanger sequencing. We identified 143 non-synonymous mutations in 756 canonical cancer-related genes and 1,271 non-synonymous mutations in non-canonical cancer-related genes in 14 endometrial samples. PTEN, KRAS and PIK3R1 were the most frequently mutated canonical cancer-related genes. Our results revealed nine potential driver genes (MAPT, IL24, MCM6, TSC1, BIRC2, CIITA, DST, CASP8 and NOTCH2) and 21 potential passenger genes (ARMCX4, IGSF10, VPS13C, DCT, DNAH14, TLN1, ZNF605, ZSCAN29, MOCOS, CMYA5, PCDH17, UGT1A8, CYFIP2, MACF1, NUDT5, JAKMIP1, PCDHGB4, FAM178A, SNX6, IMP4 and PCMTD1). The detected molecular aberrations led to putative activation of the mTOR, Wnt, MAPK, VEGF and ErbB pathways, as well as aberrant DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptosis pathways.

Both proteins preferentially bind uridine-rich sequences upstream of 3'ss via their RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). Here, we examined 36 RRM substitutions reported in cancer patients to identify variants that alter 3'ss selection, RNA binding and protein properties. Employing PUF60- and U2AF65-dependent 3'ss previously identified by RNA-seq of depleted cells, we found that 43% (10/23) and 15% (2/13) of independent RRM mutations in U2AF65 and PUF60, respectively, conferred splicing defects. At least three RRM mutations increased skipping of internal <i>U2AF2</i> (~9%, 2/23) or <i>PUF60</i> (~8%, 1/13) exons, indicating that cancer-associated RRM mutations can have both <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-acting effects on splicing. We also report residues required for correct folding/stability of each protein and map functional RRM substitutions on to existing high-resolution structures of U2AF65 and PUF60. These results identify new RRM residues critical for 3'ss selection and provide relatively simple tools to detect clonal RRM mutations that enhance the mRNA isoform diversity.",2020,3&#x2032; splice site; Functional genomics; PUF60; SF3B4; U2AF2; cancer; differential scanning fluorimetry; driver mutation; exon inclusion; gel shift assay; lariat branch point; leukemia; mRNA; pre-mRNA splicing,3

From the integrative analysis of the transcriptome and clinicopathologic data of human multi-stage HCC tissues, we were able to identify barrier-to-autointegration factor 1 (BANF1), procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 3 (PLOD3) and splicing factor 3b subunit 4 (SF3B4) as early HCC biomarkers which could be detected in precancerous lesions of HCC, with superior capabilities to diagnose eHCC compared to the currently popular HCC diagnostic biomarkers: GPC3, GS, and HSP70. We then showed that SF3B4 knockdown caused G1/S cell cycle arrest by recovering p27kip1 and simultaneously suppressing cyclins, and CDKs in liver cancer cells. Notably, we demonstrated that aberrant SF3B4 overexpression altered the progress of splicing progress of the tumor suppressor gene, kruppel like factor 4 (KLF4), and resulted in non-functional skipped exon transcripts. This contributes to liver tumorigenesis via transcriptional inactivation of p27Kip1 and simultaneous activation of Slug genes. Our results suggest that SF3B4 indicates early-stage HCC in precancerous lesions, and also functions as an early-stage driver in the development of liver cancer.

We aimed to investigate the molecular markers underlying early progression of HCC that can be detected in precancerous lesions. We designed a gene selection strategy to identify potential driver genes by integrative analysis of transcriptome and clinicopathological data of human multistage HCC tissues, including precancerous lesions, low- and high-grade dysplastic nodules. The gene selection process was guided by detecting the selected molecules in both HCC and precancerous lesion. Using various computational approaches, we selected 10 gene elements as a candidate and, through immunohistochemical staining, showed that barrier to autointegration factor 1 (BANF1), procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 3 (PLOD3), and splicing factor 3b subunit 4 (SF3B4) are HCC decision markers with superior capability to diagnose early-stage HCC in a large cohort of HCC patients, as compared to the currently popular trio of HCC diagnostic markers: glypican 3, glutamine synthetase, and heat-shock protein 70. Targeted inactivation of BANF1, PLOD3, and SF3B4 inhibits in vitro and in vivo liver tumorigenesis by selectively modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell-cycle proteins. Treatment of nanoparticles containing small-interfering RNAs of the three genes suppressed liver tumor incidence as well as tumor growth rates in a spontaneous mouse HCC model. We also demonstrated that SF3B4 overexpression triggers SF3b complex to splice tumor suppressor KLF4 transcript to nonfunctional skipped exon transcripts. This contributes to malignant transformation and growth of hepatocyte through transcriptional inactivation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and simultaneously activation of Slug genes. The findings suggest molecular markers of BANF1, PLOD3, and SF3B4 indicating early-stage HCC in precancerous lesion, and also suggest drivers for understanding the development of hepatocarcinogenesis.

Activating EGFR mutations are common in IDH1 wild-type gliomas. However, the cooperative partners of EGFR driving gliomagenesis remain poorly understood. We explore EGFR-mutant glioma evolution in conditional mutant mice by whole-exome sequencing, transposon mutagenesis forward genetic screening, and transcriptomics. We show mutant EGFR is sufficient to initiate gliomagenesis in vivo, both in the brain and spinal cord. We identify significantly recurrent somatic alterations in these gliomas including mutant EGFR amplifications and Sub1, Trp53, and Tead2 loss-of-function mutations. Comprehensive functional characterization of 96 gliomas by genome-wide piggyBac insertional mutagenesis in vivo identifies 281 known and novel EGFR-cooperating driver genes, including Cdkn2a, Nf1, Spred1, and Nav3. Transcriptomics confirms transposon-mediated effects on expression of these genes. We validate the clinical relevance of new putative tumor suppressors by showing these are frequently altered in patients' gliomas, with prognostic implications. We discover shared and distinct driver mutations in brain and spinal gliomas and confirm in vivo differential tumor suppressive effects of Pten between these tumors. Functional validation with CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutations in novel genes Tead2, Spred1, and Nav3 demonstrates heightened EGFRvIII-glioma cell proliferation. Chemogenomic analysis of mutated glioma genes reveals potential drug targets, with several investigational drugs showing efficacy in vitro.

29351612,NAV3,10.1093/annonc/mdy011,A mutational signature associated with alcohol consumption and prognostically significantly mutated driver genes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is often diagnosed at an advanced and incurable stage. Information on driver genes and prognosticators in ESCC remains incomplete. The objective was to elucidate significantly mutated genes (SMGs), mutational signatures, and prognosticators in ESCC. Three MutSig algorithms (i.e. MutSigCV, MutSigCL and MutSigFN) and '20/20+' ratio-metric were employed to identify SMGs. Nonnegative matrix factorization was used to decipher mutational signatures. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, multivariate Cox and logistic regression models were applied to analyze association between mutational features and clinical parameters. We identified 26 SMGs, including 8 novel (NAV3, TENM3, PTCH1, TGFBR2, RIPK4, PBRM1, USP8 and BAP1) and 18 that have been previously reported. Three mutational signatures were identified to be prevalent in ESCC including clocklike C&gt;T at CpG, APOBEC overactive C&gt;T at TpCp[A/T], and a signature featured by T&gt;C substitution. The T&gt;C mutational signature was significantly correlated with alcohol consumption (OR: 3.59; 95% CI: 2.30-5.67; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). This alcohol consumption signature was also observed in liver cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and its mutational activity was substantially higher in samples with mutations in TP53. Survival analysis revealed that TENM3 mutations (HR: 5.54; CI: 2.68-11.45; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and TP53 hotspot mutation p.R213* (HR: 3.37; CI: 1.73-8.06; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) were significantly associated with shortened survival outcome. The association remained statistically significant after controlling for age, gender, TNM stage and tumor grade. We have uncovered several new SMGs in ESCC and defined an alcohol consumption related mutational signature.

We sought to identify potential cancer drivers in clinically aggressive neuroblastoma.Whole exome sequencing was conducted on 17 germline and tumor DNA samples from high-risk patients with adverse events within 36 months from diagnosis (HR-Event3) to identify somatic mutations and deep targeted sequencing of 134 genes selected from the initial screening in additional 48 germline and tumor pairs (62.5% HR-Event3 and high-risk patients), 17 HR-Event3 tumors and 17 human-derived neuroblastoma cell lines.We revealed 22 significantly mutated genes, many of which implicated in cancer progression. Fifteen genes (68.2%) were highly expressed in neuroblastoma supporting their involvement in the disease. CHD9, a cancer driver gene, was the most significantly altered (4.0% of cases) after ALK.Other genes (PTK2, NAV3, NAV1, FZD1 and ATRX), expressed in neuroblastoma and involved in cell invasion and migration were mutated at frequency ranged from 4% to 2%.Focal adhesion and regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathways, were frequently disrupted (14.1% of cases) thus suggesting potential novel therapeutic strategies to prevent disease progression.Notably BARD1, CHEK2 and AXIN2 were enriched in rare, potentially pathogenic, germline variants.In summary, whole exome and deep targeted sequencing identified novel cancer genes of clinically aggressive neuroblastoma.

Excessive proliferation and resistance to apoptosis of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) is one of the most important drivers of vascular remodeling in PAH, for which available treatments have limited effectiveness.<b>Objectives:</b> To gain insights into the mechanisms leading to the development of the disease and identify new actionable targets.<b>Methods:</b> Protein expression profiling was conducted by two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in isolated PASMCs from controls and patients with PAH. Multiple molecular, biochemical, and pharmacologic approaches were used to decipher the role of NUDT1 (nudrix hyrolase 1) in PAH.<b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Increased expression of the detoxifying DNA enzyme NUDT1 was detected in cells and tissues from patients with PAH and animal models. <i>In vitro</i>, molecular or pharmacological inhibition of NUDT1 in PAH-PASMCs induced accumulation of oxidized nucleotides in the DNA, irresolvable DNA damage (comet assay), disruption of cellular bioenergetics (Seahorse), and cell death (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay). In two animal models with established PAH (i.e., monocrotaline and Sugen/hypoxia-treated rats), pharmacological inhibition of NUDT1 using (S)-Crizotinib significantly decreased pulmonary vascular remodeling and improved hemodynamics and cardiac function.<b>Conclusions:</b> Our results indicate that, by overexpressing NUDT1, PAH-PASMCs hijack persistent oxidative stress in preventing incorporation of oxidized nucleotides into DNA, thus allowing the cell to escape apoptosis and proliferate. Given that NUDT1 inhibitors are under clinical investigation for cancer, they may represent a new therapeutic option for PAH.",2021,"DNA damage; MTH1; oxidative stress; pulmonary hypertension; smooth muscle cells; 8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine; Adult; Aged; Animals; Apoptosis; Blotting, Western; Case-Control Studies; Cell Proliferation; Chromatography, Liquid; Comet Assay; DNA; DNA Repair Enzymes; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Forkhead Box Protein M1; Humans; In Vitro Techniques; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension; Pulmonary Artery; Pyrophosphatases; RNA, Messenger; Rats; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Up-Regulation; Vascular Remodeling",2

Cellular models of RAS-dependent cancers have been used to identify experimental small molecules, such as SCH51344, but their molecular mechanism of action remains generally unknown. Here, using a chemical proteomic approach, we identify the target of SCH51344 as the human mutT homologue MTH1 (also known as NUDT1), a nucleotide pool sanitizing enzyme. Loss-of-function of MTH1 impaired growth of KRAS tumour cells, whereas MTH1 overexpression mitigated sensitivity towards SCH51344. Searching for more drug-like inhibitors, we identified the kinase inhibitor crizotinib as a nanomolar suppressor of MTH1 activity. Surprisingly, the clinically used (R)-enantiomer of the drug was inactive, whereas the (S)-enantiomer selectively inhibited MTH1 catalytic activity. Enzymatic assays, chemical proteomic profiling, kinome-wide activity surveys and MTH1 co-crystal structures of both enantiomers provide a rationale for this remarkable stereospecificity. Disruption of nucleotide pool homeostasis via MTH1 inhibition by (S)-crizotinib induced an increase in DNA single-strand breaks, activated DNA repair in human colon carcinoma cells, and effectively suppressed tumour growth in animal models. Our results propose (S)-crizotinib as an attractive chemical entity for further pre-clinical evaluation, and small-molecule inhibitors of MTH1 in general as a promising novel class of anticancer agents.",2014,"Aminoquinolines; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Colonic Neoplasms; Crizotinib; Crystallization; DNA Breaks, Single-Stranded; DNA Repair; DNA Repair Enzymes; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Homeostasis; Humans; Mice; Mice, SCID; Models, Molecular; Nucleotides; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Protein Conformation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proteomics; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Pyrazoles; Pyridines; Substrate Specificity; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; ras Proteins",2

For instance, the translocation t(12;21)(p13;q22), representing the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene (ER), is present in a quarter of BCP-ALL cases. However, around 10% of the cases lack classifying chromosomal abnormalities (B-other). In pediatric ER BCP-ALL, rearrangement mediated by RAG (recombination-activating genes) has been proposed as the predominant driver of oncogenic rearrangement. Herein we analyzed almost 1600 pediatric BCP-ALL samples to determine which subtypes express RAG. We demonstrate that RAG1 mRNA levels are especially high in the ETV6-RUNX1 (ER) subtype and in a subset of B-other samples. We also define 31 genes that are co-expressed with RAG1 (RAG1-signature) in the ER subtype, a signature that also identifies this subset of B-other samples. Moreover, this subset also shares leukemia and pro-B gene expression signatures as well as high levels of the ETV6 target genes (BIRC7, WBP1L, CLIC5, ANGPTL2) with the ER subtype, indicating that these B-other cases are the recently identified ER-like subtype. We validated our results in a cohort where ER-like has been defined, which confirmed expression of the RAG1-signature in this recently described subtype. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the RAG1-signature identifies the ER-like subtype. As there are no definitive genetic markers to identify this novel subtype, the RAG1-signature represents a means to screen for this leukemia in children.",2021,"BCP-ALL; ETV6-RUNX1; ETV6-RUNX1-like; RAG1; leukemia; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Angiopoietin-Like Protein 2; B-Lymphocytes; Child; Chloride Channels; Chromosome Aberrations; Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Profiling; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins; Membrane Proteins; Microfilament Proteins; Neoplasm Proteins; Nuclear Proteins; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets; RNA, Messenger; Repressor Proteins; Transcriptome; Translocation, Genetic",1

For two of these regions, 8p12 and 10q26, we previously reported the amplification of genes encoding FGF receptors, FGFRI/FLG and FGFR2/BEK, in about 12% of breast tumors. The PLAT gene, encoding the tissue-type plasminogen activator, is also located close to or within the 8p12 region. In the present study, we show that both FGFRI and PLAT can be amplified in breast as well as ovarian carcinomas. FGFRI amplification was detected in 14.5% of breast and 7.8% of ovarian tumors, whereas PLAT was found to be amplified in 15.6% and 19.4% of the tumors, respectively. Each gene could be amplified independently of the other. These data raised the question of which gene is selected for amplification at 8p12. In most cases, the levels of expression of FGFRI and PLAT in breast tumors were comparable to their level of expression in normal mammary tissue. However, FGFRI was expressed above the normal level in a certain number of cases.

CRC tumorigenesis is also driven by multiple epi-mutational modifiers, such as transcriptional regulators. We describe the common (and near-universal) activation of the zinc finger transcription factor and Let-7 target PLAGL2 in CRC and find that it is a key driver of intestinal epithelial transformation. PLAGL2 drives proliferation, cell cycle progression, and anchorage-independent growth in CRC cell lines and non-transformed intestinal cells. Investigating effects of PLAGL2 on downstream pathways revealed very modest effects on canonical Wnt signaling. Alternatively, we find pronounced effects on the direct PLAGL2 target genes IGF2, a fetal growth factor, and ASCL2, an intestinal stem cell-specific bHLH transcription factor. Inactivation of PLAGL2 in CRC cell lines has pronounced effects on ASCL2 reporter activity. Furthermore, ASCL2 expression can partially rescue deficits of proliferation and cell cycle progression caused by depletion of PLAGL2 in CRC cell lines. Thus, the oncogenic effects of PLAGL2 appear to be mediated via core stem cell and onco-fetal pathways, with minimal effects on downstream Wnt signaling.",2023,Colorectal Cancer; IGF2; PLAGL2; Tumorigenesis; Wnt,316

We defined the clinical and molecular impact of heritable alterations in appendiceal adenocarcinoma to evaluate the need for dedicated appendiceal screening and prevention strategies in patients with LP/P germline variants. We performed an integrated germline and somatic molecular analysis for patients with confirmed appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Patients underwent paired tumor-normal sequencing for up to 90 hereditary cancer risk genes and 505 genes for somatic mutation profiling. We defined the cooccurrence of LP/P germline variants and second-hit pathogenic somatic alterations. The associations between germline variants and patient clinicopathologic features were also evaluated. Twenty-five of 237 patients (10.5%) carried pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in cancer susceptibility genes. Clinicopathologic characteristics and appendiceal adenocarcinoma-specific survival were similar in patients with or without germline variants. Most (92%, N = 23/25) patients with germline variants demonstrated no second-hit somatic alterations, including loss of heterozygosity. Two patients with a germline APC I1307K low-penetrance founder variant exhibited secondary somatic pathogenic alterations in APC. However, only one patient tumor exhibited APC-mediated WNT signaling dysregulation: a plausible consequence of multiple somatic APC mutations with no germline variant contribution. Four patients had germline variants in PMS2 or MSH2 associated with Lynch syndrome, yet their cancers were microsatellite-stable. Germline variants are likely incidental without a contributory driver role in appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Appendiceal adenocarcinoma screening in patients with germline variants is not clearly merited.",2023,NA,316

A <i>TP53</i> intronic mutation (c.782+1G&gt;T) was the only pathogenic splice_donor_variant&#xa0;found in this HBL tumor. The frequency of variants and Phred scores were markedly high, and the p-values&#xa0;were significant for all of the aforementioned mutations. In summary, a total of 15 missense, 10&#xa0;synonymous, and 19 intronic variants were identified in the HBL tumor. Results of the&#xa0;present study detected one novel insertion in <i>NRAS</i> and one novel deletion in <i>HNF1A</i> genes, a novel&#xa0;missense variant in the <i>TP53</i> gene, and two novel missense variants of <i>SND1</i>.

Pre-chemoradiation (CRT) biopsy and post-CRT surgical specimens were obtained from 27 patients undergoing neoadjuvant CRT followed by definitive resection. Exomes were sequenced to a mean coverage of 30&#xd7;. Somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (indels) were identified. Tumor mutational burden was defined as the number of SNVs or indels. Mutational signatures were extracted and fitted to COSMIC reference signatures. Tumor heterogeneity was quantified with a mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH) score. Genetic biomarkers and frequently occurred copy number alterations (CNAs) were compared between pre- and post-CRT specimens. Their associations with tumor regression grade (TRG) and clinical outcomes were explored. Top five mutated genes were APC, TP53, NF1, KRAS, and NOTCH1 for pre-CRT samples and APC, TP53, NF1, CREBBP, and ATM for post-CRT samples. Several gene mutations including RUNX1, EGFR, and TP53 in pre-CRT samples showed significant association with clinical outcomes, but not with TRG. However, no such association was found in post-CRT samples. Discordance of driver mutation status was found between pre- and post-CRT samples. In tumor mutational burden analysis, higher number of SNVs or indels was associated with worse treatment outcomes. Six single-base substitution (SBS) signatures identified were SBS1, SBS30, SBS29, SBS49, SBS3, and SBS44. The MATH score decreased after CRT on paired analysis. Less than half of CNAs frequent in post-CRT samples were present in pre-CRT samples. Pre- and post-CRT samples showed different genomic landscape. Potential genetic biomarkers of pre-CRT samples found in the current analysis call for external validation.",2023,neoadjuvant chemoradiation; rectal cancer; whole-exome sequencing,316

We defined the clinical and molecular impact of heritable alterations in AC to evaluate the need for dedicated appendiceal screening and prevention strategies in patients with LP/P germline variants. We performed an integrated germline and somatic molecular analysis for patients with confirmed AC. Patients underwent paired tumor-normal sequencing for up to 90 hereditary cancer-risk genes and 505 genes for somatic mutation profiling. We defined the co-occurrence of LP/P germline variants and second-hit pathogenic somatic alterations. The associations between germline variants and patient clinicopathologic features were also evaluated. Twenty-five out of 237 patients (10.5%) carried pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in cancer susceptibility genes. Clinicopathologic characteristics and AC-specific survival were similar in patients with or without germline variants. Most (92%, N=23/25) patients with germline variants demonstrated no second-hit somatic alterations, including loss of heterozygosity. Two patients with a germline APC I1307K low-penetrance founder variant exhibited secondary somatic pathogenic alterations in APC. However only one patient tumor exhibited APC-mediated WNT-signaling dysregulation; a plausible consequence of multiple somatic APC mutations with no germline variant contribution. Four patients had germline variants in PMS2 or MSH2 associated with Lynch Syndrome, yet their cancers were microsatellite-stable. Germline variants are likely incidental without a contributory driver role in AC. AC screening in patients with germline variants is not clearly merited.",2023,NA,316

To understand the landscape of NRG1 gene fusions, 4397 solid tumor formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples consecutively tested by comprehensive genomic and immune profiling during standard care were analyzed. Nineteen NRG1 fusions were found in 17 unique patients, across multiple tumor types, including non-small-cell lung (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;7), breast (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;2), colorectal (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;3), esophageal (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;2), ovarian (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;1), pancreatic (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;1), and unknown primary (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;1) carcinomas, with a cumulative incidence of 0.38%. Fusions were identified with breakpoints across four NRG1 introns spanning 1.4 megabases, with a mixture of known (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;8) and previously unreported (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;11) fusion partners. Co-occurring driver alterations in tumors with NRG1 fusions were uncommon, except colorectal carcinoma, where concurrent alterations in APC, BRAF, and ERBB2 were present in a subset of cases. The overall lack of co-occurring drivers highlights the importance of identifying NRG1 gene fusions, as these patients are unlikely to harbor other targetable alterations. In addition, RNA sequencing is important to identify NRG1 gene fusions given the variety of fusion partners and large genomic areas where breakpoints can occur.",2023,NA,316

CUP can be life-threatening with a median overall survival of less than 1 year based on empirical chemotherapy. Gene detection technology advances the driver gene detection of malignant tumors and the appropriate precise therapy. Immunotherapy has ushered in a new era in cancer therapy, changing the way advanced tumors, including CUP, are treated. Combined with comprehensive clinical and pathological investigations, molecular analysis of the original tissue and detection of potential driver mutations may provide therapeutic recommendations for CUP. A 52-year-old female was admitted to hospital for dull abdominal pain, with peripancreatic lesions below the caudate lobe of the liver and posterior peritoneal lymph nodes enlargement. Conventional biopsy under endoscopic ultrasonography and laparoscopic biopsy both revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma based on immunohistochemical series. To help identify tumor origin and molecular characteristics, 90-gene expression assay, tumor gene expression profiling with Next-generation sequencing (NGS) method and Immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 were employed. Although no gastroesophageal lesions discovered by gastroenteroscopy, the 90-gene expression assay yielded a similarity score and prompted the most likely primary site was gastric/esophagus cancer. NGS revealed high TMB (19.3mutations/Mb) but no druggable driver genes identified. The Dako PD-L1 22C3 assay IHC assay for PD-L1 expression revealed a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 35%. Given the presence of negative predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy, including adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) c.646C&gt;T mutation at exon 7 and Janus kinase 1(JAK1), the patient received immunochemotherapy instead of immunotherapy alone. She was successfully treated with nivolumab plus carboplatin and albumin-bound nanoparticle paclitaxel for six cycles and nivolumab maintenance, which achieved a complete response (CR) maintained for 2 years without severe adverse events. This case highlights the value of multidisciplinary diagnosis and individual precision treatment in CUP. Further investigation is needed as an individualized treatment approach combining immunotherapy and chemotherapy based on tumor molecular characteristics and immunotherapy predictors is expected to improve the outcome of CUP therapy.",2023,"cancer of unknown primary; case report; gene expression profiling; immunochemotherapy; metastatic adenocarcinoma; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Nivolumab; B7-H1 Antigen; Neoplasms, Unknown Primary; Adenocarcinoma; Gene Expression Profiling; Immunotherapy",316

Thus, to improve clinical care of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, we explored the role of age-related p16 epimutation in intestinal tumorigenesis. We established a mouse model that replicates two common genetic and epigenetic events observed in human CRCs: Apc mutation and p16 epimutation. We conducted long-term survival and histological analysis of tumor development and progression. Colonic epithelial cells and tumors were collected from mice and analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize tumor-infiltrating immune cells throughout tumor progression. We tested whether anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy affects overall survival of tumor-bearing mice and whether inhibition of both epigenetic regulation and immune checkpoint is more efficacious. Mice carrying combined Apc mutation and p16 epimutation had significantly shortened survival and increased tumor growth compared to those with Apc mutation only. Intriguingly, colon tumors with p16 epimutation exhibited an activated interferon pathway, increased expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (Pdl1), and enhanced infiltration of immune cells. scRNA-seq further revealed the presence of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and &#x3b3;&#x3b4;T17 cells, which contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, we showed that a combined therapy using an inhibitor of DNA methylation and a PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor is more effective for improving survival in tumor-bearing mice than blockade of either pathway alone. Our study demonstrated that age-dependent p16 epimutation creates a permissive microenvironment for malignant transformation of polyps to colon cancer.

In this study, we show that mTOR inhibition potently suppresses intestinal polyp formation, regresses established polyps, and prolongs lifespan of APC<sup>Min/+</sup> mice. Everolimus in diet strongly reduces p-4EBP1, p-S6, and Myc levels, and induces apoptosis of cells with activated &#x3b2;-catenin (p-S552) in the polyps on day 3. The cell death is accompanied by ER stress, activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, innate immune cell recruitment, and followed by T-cell infiltration on day 14 persisting for months thereafter. These effects are absent in normal intestinal crypts with physiologic levels of Myc and a high rate of proliferation. Using normal human colonic epithelial cells, EIF4E S209A knockin and BID knockout mice, we found that local inflammation and antitumor efficacy of Everolimus requires Myc-dependent induction of ER stress and apoptosis. These findings demonstrate mTOR and deregulated Myc as a selective vulnerability of mutant APC-driven intestinal tumorigenesis, whose inhibition disrupts metabolic and immune adaptation and reactivates immune surveillance necessary for long-term tumor control.",2023,"Mice; Humans; Animals; Everolimus; Immunogenic Cell Death; Colorectal Neoplasms; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Signal Transduction; Mice, Knockout; beta Catenin",316

Pioneering studies in the field have indicated the presence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) spanning Apc in a subset of sporadic and radiation-induced intestinal tumors of ApcMin/+ mice, albeit with a substantial subset in which LOH was not detected; whether copy number losses accompany such LOH has also been unclear. Herein, we analyzed intestinal tumors of C3B6F1 ApcMin/+ mice that were either left untreated or irradiated with 2&#xa0;Gy of &#x3b3;-rays. We observed intratumor mosaicism with respect to the nuclear/cytoplasmic accumulation of immunohistochemically detectable &#x3b2;-catenin, which is a hallmark of Apc+ allele loss. An immunoguided laser microdissection approach enabled the detection of LOH involving the Apc+ allele in &#x3b2;-catenin-overexpressing cells; in contrast, the LOH was not observed in the non-overexpressing cells. With this improvement, LOH involving Apc+ was detected in all 22 tumors analyzed, in contrast to what has been reported previously. The use of a formalin-free fixative facilitated the LOH and microarray-based DNA copy number analyses, enabling the classification of the aberrations as nondisjunction/mitotic recombination type or interstitial deletion type. Of note, the latter was observed only in radiation-induced tumors (nonirradiated, 0 of 8; irradiated, 11 of 14). Thus, an analysis considering intratumor heterogeneity identifies interstitial deletion involving the Apc+ allele as a causative radiation-related event in intestinal tumors of ApcMin/+ mice, providing an accurate approach for attributing individual tumors to radiation exposure.",2023," ApcMin /+ mouse; immunoguided laser microdissection; interstitial deletion; intestinal tumor; radiation signature; Mice; Animals; beta Catenin; Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced; Mutation; Loss of Heterozygosity; Intestinal Neoplasms",316

However, the characteristic of APC specific mutations in mCRC is poorly understood. Here, we explored the clinical and molecular characteristics of N-terminal and C-terminal side APC mutations in Chinese patients with mCRC. Hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on tumor tissues from 275 mCRC patients to detect mutations in 639 tumor-associated genes. The prognostic value and gene-pathway difference between APC specific mutations in mCRC patients were analyzed. APC mutations were highly clustered, accounting for 73% of all mCRC patients, and most of them were truncating mutations. The tumor mutation burden (TMB) of the N-terminal side APC mutations group (n=76) was significantly lower than that of the C-terminal side group (n=123) (p&lt;0.001), further confirmed by the public database. Survival analysis showed that mCRC patients with N-terminus side APC mutations had longer overall survival (OS) than C-terminus side. Tumor gene pathway analysis showed that gene mutations in the RTK/RAS, Wnt and TGF&#x3b2; signaling pathways of the C-terminal group were significantly higher than those of the N-terminal group (p&lt;0.05). Additionally, KRAS, AMER1, TGFBR2, and ARID1A driver mutations were more common in patients with C-terminal side APC mutations. APC specific mutations have potential function as mCRC prognostic biomarkers.

Since then, the importance of APC in normal tissue homeostasis has been confirmed in a plethora of other (model) organisms spanning a large evolutionary space. APC is a multifunctional protein, with roles as a key scaffold protein in complexes involved in diverse signalling pathways, most prominently the Wnt signalling pathway. APC is also a cytoskeletal regulator with direct and indirect links to and impacts on all three major cytoskeletal networks. Correspondingly, a wide range of APC binding partners have been identified. Mutations in APC are extremely strongly associated with colorectal cancers, particularly those that result in the production of truncated proteins and the loss of significant regions from the remaining protein. Understanding the complement of its role in health and disease requires knowing the relationship between and regulation of its diverse functions and interactions. This in turn requires understanding its structural and biochemical features. Here we set out to provide a brief overview of the roles and function of APC and then explore its conservation and structure using the extensive sequence data, which is now available, and spans a broad range of taxonomy.

Here, we use mass cytometry of isogenic human colon organoids and patient-derived cancer organoids to capture oncogenic signaling, cell phenotypes, and differentiation states in a high-dimensional single-cell map. We define a differentiation axis in all tumor progression states from normal to cancer. Our data show that colorectal cancer driver mutations shape the distribution of cells along the differentiation axis. In this regard, subsequent mutations can have stem cell promoting or restricting effects. Individual nodes of the cancer cell signaling network remain coupled to the differentiation state, regardless of the presence of driver mutations.

This study aimed to investigate the expression profiling of these genes along with immunotherapeutic target molecules in CTCs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Expression of <i>p53</i>, <i>APC</i>, <i>KRAS</i>, <i>c-Myc</i>, and immunotherapeutic target molecules <i>PD-L1</i>, <i>CTLA-4</i>, and <i>CD47</i> in CTCs and PBMCs were analysed by qPCR. Their expression in high versus low CTC-positive patients with CRC was compared and clinicopathological correlations between these patient groups were analysed. CTCs were detected in 61% (38 of 62) of patients with CRC. The presence of higher numbers of CTCs was significantly correlated with advanced cancer stages (<i>p</i> = 0.045) and the subtypes of adenocarcinoma (conventional vs. mucinous, <i>p</i> = 0.019), while being weakly correlated with tumour size (<i>p</i> = 0.051). Patients with lower numbers of CTCs had higher expression of <i>KRAS</i>. Higher <i>KRAS</i> expression in CTCs was negatively correlated with tumour perforation (<i>p</i> = 0.029), lymph node status (<i>p</i> = 0.037), distant metastasis (<i>p</i> = 0.046) and overall staging (<i>p</i> = 0.004). <i>CTLA-4</i> was highly expressed in both CTCs and PBMCs.

Recent studies investigated the clinicopathologic and molecular features of IPNB, which contributed to a more detailed understanding of this undercharacterized neoplasm. To summarize driver gene mutations, radiologic tumor evolution, and a potentially unique pattern of tumor progression in IPNB. Data were derived from a literature review and personal clinical and research experiences. In contrast to de novo cholangiocarcinoma, type 1 IPNB often has mutations in APC, CTNNB1, STK11, and GNAS. These molecular features are shared with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas; however, the frequencies of individual gene abnormalities differ between these 2 neoplasms. A radiologic review of sequential images suggested that type 1 IPNB is a slow-growing neoplasm, with an &#x223c;1-cm increase in size every 2 to 3 years, and remains in a noninvasive state for many years. A similar papillary neoplasm may develop in the biliary tree years after the complete surgical resection of IPNB. The second neoplasm has the same genetic abnormalities as the first neoplasm, indicating intrabiliary implantation rather than multifocal lesions. In contrast to type 1 IPNB, most cases of type 2 IPNB have invasive malignancy at the initial presentation.

The role of the p53 tumor suppressor in WGD has been enigmatic: p53 can block the proliferation of tetraploid cells, acting as a barrier to WGD, but can also promote mitotic bypass, a key step in WGD via endoreduplication. In wild-type (WT) p53 tumors, WGD is frequently associated with activation of the E2F pathway, especially amplification of CCNE1, encoding cyclin E1. Here, we show that elevated cyclin E1&#xa0;expression causes replicative stress, which activates ATR- and Chk1-dependent G2 phase arrest. p53, via its downstream target p21, together with Wee1, then inhibits mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase activity sufficiently to activate APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup> and promote mitotic bypass.

A retrospective analysis of the data of 60 patients with stage IV mCRC who received cetuximab at The First and Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from 2016 to 2020 was conducted. The patients were divided into the following 3 groups according to the genetic test results: (I) group A (the all-<i>RAS</i> wild-type group); (II) group B (the all-<i>RAS</i> wild-type group with the tumor suppressor gene mutation); and (III) group C (the all-<i>RAS</i> wild-type group with the oncogenic driver gene mutation). A subgroup analysis was conducted to examine left CRC and local intervention, and the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of the patients were observed.

ACC may rarely occur as part of familial cancer syndromes, but even in sporadic cases, a significant proportion of patients had other malignancies before or after diagnosis of ACC. Herein we present three cases where sporadic ACC was identified in patients with coexistent or previous history of melanoma. Patient 1 - A 37-yr-old man with a superficial spreading BRAF-positive melanoma was found to harbour a progressively growing left adrenal mass. Initially, he was suspected of having adrenal metastasis, but the histology after adrenalectomy confirmed ACC. Patient 2 - A 68-year-old man with a history of recurrent BRAF-positive melanoma was diagnosed with disseminated metastatic melanoma recurrence, including a rapidly enlarging left adrenal mass. Consequently, he underwent left adrenalectomy, and histology again confirmed ACC. Patient 3 - A 50-yr-old man was referred with histological diagnosis of metastatic ACC. He had a background history of pT1 melanoma. We undertook targeted sequencing of ACC tissue samples in all cases. Somatic variants were observed in the known driver genes CTNNB1 (Patient 1), APC and KMT2D (Patient 2), and APC and TP53 (Patient 3). Germline TP53 variants (Li-Fraumeni syndrome) were excluded in all cases. Retrospective review of our patient cohort in the last 21&#x2009;years revealed a frequency of 0.5% of histologically diagnosed melanoma metastasis among patients referred for adrenal masses. On the other hand, 1.6% of patients with histologically confirmed ACC had a previous history of melanoma.

However, whether the negative selection of cells that have lost malignant properties contributes to cancer progression has not yet been fully investigated. Using intestinal metastatic tumor-derived organoids carrying Apc, Kras, Tgfbr2, and Trp53 quadruple mutations, we demonstrate here that approximately 30% of subclones of the organoids show loss of metastatic ability to the liver while keeping the driver mutations and oncogenic pathways. Notably, highly metastatic subclones also showed a gradual loss of metastatic ability during further passages. Such non-metastatic subclones revealed significantly decreased survival and proliferation ability in Matrigel and collagen gel culture conditions, which may cause elimination from the tumor tissues in vivo. RNA sequencing indicated that stemness-related genes, including Lgr5 and Myb, were significantly downregulated in non-metastatic subclones as well as subclones that lost metastatic ability during additional passages. Furthermore, a CGH analysis showed that non-metastatic subclones were derived from a minor population of parental organoid cells. These results indicate that metastatic ability is continuously lost with decreased stem cell property in certain subpopulations of malignant tumors, and such subpopulations are eliminated by negative selection. Therefore, it is possible that cancer evolution is regulated not only by positive selection but also by negative selection. The mechanism underlying the loss of metastatic ability will be important for the future development of therapeutic strategies against metastasis.",2023,"cancer evolution; colon cancer; metastasis; negative selection; organoids; Humans; Intestinal Neoplasms; Intestines; Mutation; Genes, ras; Organoids; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)",316
36548952,APC,10.1093/carcin/bgac101,Endometrial hyperplasia with loss of APC in a novel population of Lyz2-expressing mouse endometrial epithelial cells.,"Loss of heterozygosity and promoter hypermethylation of APC is frequently observed in human endometrial cancer, which is the most common gynecological cancer in the USA, but its carcinogenic driver status in the endometrial epithelium has not been confirmed. We have identified a novel population of progenitor endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) in mice that express lysozyme M (LysM) and give rise to approximately 15% of all EECs in adult mice. LysM is a glycoside hydrolase that is encoded by Lyz2 and functions to protect cells from bacteria as part of the innate immune system. Its expression has been shown in a subset of hematopoietic stem cells and in specialized lung and small intestinal epithelial cells. Conditional deletion of Apc in LysM + EECs results in significantly more epithelial cells compared to wild-type mice. At 5 months of age, the ApccKO mice have enlarged uterine horns with pathology that is consistent with endometrial hyperplasia with cystic endometrial glands, non-villous luminal papillae and nuclear atypia. Nuclear accumulation of &#x3b2;-catenin and ER&#x3b1;, both of which are known to induce endometrial hyperplasia, was observed in the EECs of the ApccKO mice. These results confirm that loss of APC in EECs can result in a phenotype similar to endometrial hyperplasia.",2023,Adult; Female; Humans; Mice; Animals; Endometrial Hyperplasia; Epithelial Cells; Endometrium; Endometrial Neoplasms; Stem Cells,316

While individual tumor sequencing studies have discovered driver mutations in SCC, there has yet to be a review and subsequent analysis synthesizing current studies. To conduct a comprehensive synthesis and analysis of SCC sequencing studies with individual patient-level data, a comprehensive literature search was performed. Statistical analyses were performed to identify trends. Studies meeting inclusion criteria included a total of 279 patients (189 localized SCCs, 90 metastatic SCCs). Several mutations were correlated with demographic characteristics (TP53, MLL4, BRCA2, COL4A1). TP53, TERT, SPEN, MLL3, and NOTCH2 mutations were significantly more likely to be found in metastatic versus localized SCCs even after the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Silent mutations were found more in localized SCCs than metastatic SCCs, and nonsense mutations were found more in metastatic SCCs than localized SCCs (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0003 and p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04, respectively). Additional mutations were identified that have not yet been explored in SCC including AHNAK2, LRP1B, TRIO, MDN1, COL4A2, SVIL, VPS13C, DST, DMD, and DYSF. Overall, novel mutations were identified and differences between mutation patterns in localized and metastatic SCCs were found.

This information is vitally important in Taiwan, where endometrial cancer is the second most common gynecological cancer. We performed whole-exome sequencing on DNA from 14 tumor tissue samples from Taiwanese endometrial cancer patients. We used the Genome Analysis Tool kit software package for data analysis, and the dbSNP, Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases for comparisons. Variants were validated via Sanger sequencing. We identified 143 non-synonymous mutations in 756 canonical cancer-related genes and 1,271 non-synonymous mutations in non-canonical cancer-related genes in 14 endometrial samples. PTEN, KRAS and PIK3R1 were the most frequently mutated canonical cancer-related genes. Our results revealed nine potential driver genes (MAPT, IL24, MCM6, TSC1, BIRC2, CIITA, DST, CASP8 and NOTCH2) and 21 potential passenger genes (ARMCX4, IGSF10, VPS13C, DCT, DNAH14, TLN1, ZNF605, ZSCAN29, MOCOS, CMYA5, PCDH17, UGT1A8, CYFIP2, MACF1, NUDT5, JAKMIP1, PCDHGB4, FAM178A, SNX6, IMP4 and PCMTD1).

Giant cell tumours of bone (GCTs) are characterised by a mutated histone H3.3 as the sole genetic driver present in bone-forming osteoprogenitor cells but absent from abnormally large bone-resorbing osteoclasts which represent the hallmark of these neoplasms. While these striking features imply a pathogenic interaction between mesenchymal and myelomonocytic lineages during GCT development, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We show that the changes in the transcriptome and epigenome in the mesenchymal cells caused by the H3.3-G34W mutation contribute to increase osteoclast recruitment in part via reduced expression of the TGF&#x3b2;-like soluble factor, SCUBE3. Transcriptional changes in SCUBE3 are associated with altered histone marks and H3.3<sup>G34W</sup> enrichment at its enhancer regions. In turn, osteoclasts secrete unregulated amounts of SEMA4D which enhances proliferation of mutated osteoprogenitors arresting their maturation. These findings provide a mechanism by which GCTs undergo differentiation in response to denosumab, a drug that depletes the tumour of osteoclasts. In contrast, hTERT alterations, commonly found in malignant GCT, result in the histone-mutated neoplastic cells being independent of osteoclasts for their proliferation, predicting unresponsiveness to denosumab. We provide a mechanism for the initiation of GCT, the basis of which is dysfunctional cross-talk between bone-forming and bone-resorbing cells. The findings highlight the role of tumour/microenvironment bidirectional interactions in tumorigenesis and how this is exploited in the treatment of GCT.",2022,Humans; Giant Cell Tumor of Bone; Histones; Denosumab; Bone Neoplasms; Osteoclasts; Bone Remodeling; Tumor Microenvironment; Calcium-Binding Proteins,4

Thus, CTCs provide a unique patient biopsy resource to decipher the cellular subpopulations that initiate metastasis and their molecular properties. However, one crucial question is whether CTCs derived and expanded <i>ex vivo</i> from patients recapitulate human metastatic disease in an animal model. Here, we show that CTC lines established from patients with breast cancer are capable of generating metastases in mice with a pattern recapitulating most major organs from corresponding patients. Genome-wide sequencing analyses of metastatic variants identified semaphorin 4D as a regulator of tumor cell transmigration through the blood-brain barrier and MYC as a crucial regulator for the adaptation of disseminated tumor cells to the activated brain microenvironment. These data provide the direct experimental evidence of the promising role of CTCs as a prognostic factor for site-specific metastasis. SIGNIFICANCE: Interests abound in gaining new knowledge of the physiopathology of brain metastasis. In a direct metastatic tropism analysis, we demonstrated that <i>ex vivo</i>-cultured CTCs from 4 patients with breast cancer showed organotropism, revealing molecular features that allow a subset of CTCs to enter and grow in the brain.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1</i>.",2021,"Animals; Antigens, CD; Apoptosis; Biomarkers, Tumor; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain Neoplasms; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Proliferation; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glutathione Peroxidase; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; Neoplastic Cells, Circulating; Oxidative Stress; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Semaphorins; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Tumor Microenvironment; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; Glutathione Peroxidase GPX1",4

Osteosarcoma is associated with massive genomic instability, making it problematic to identify driver genes using human tumors or prototypical mouse models, many of which involve loss of Trp53 function. To identify the genes driving osteosarcoma development and metastasis, we performed a Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon-based forward genetic screen in mice with and without somatic loss of Trp53. Common insertion site (CIS) analysis of 119 primary tumors and 134 metastatic nodules identified 232 sites associated with osteosarcoma development and 43 sites associated with metastasis, respectively. Analysis of CIS-associated genes identified numerous known and new osteosarcoma-associated genes enriched in the ErbB, PI3K-AKT-mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways.

Malignant meningiomas are rare and are typically associated with a higher risk of local tumor recurrence and a poorer prognosis (median survival time &lt;2 years). Previous genome-wide association studies and exome sequencing studies have identified genes that play a role in susceptibility to meningiomas, but these studies did not focus specifically on malignant tumors. We performed exome sequencing on five malignant meningiomas on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon kits. We used wANNOVAR web server to annotate and prioritize variants, identified candidate genes with recurrent mutations, and validated selected mutations by Sanger sequencing. We next designed custom NimbleGen targeted region arrays on five candidate genes, and sequenced four additional malignant meningiomas. From exome sequencing data, we identified several frequently mutated genes including NF2, MN1, ARID1B, SEMA4D, and MUC2, with private mutations in tumors. We sequenced these genes in four additional samples and identified potential driver mutations in NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2) and MN1 (meningioma 1). We confirmed that mutations in NF2 may play a role in progression of meningiomas, and nominated MN1 as a candidate gene for malignant transformation of meningiomas.

Blocking the release of Wnt in distinct stromal cell types suggests obligatory functions of several stromal cell sources and yields different observations. The physiological contribution of epithelial Wnt to tissue homeostasis remains unclear. We show here that blocking epithelial Wnts affects colonic Reg4+ epithelial cell differentiation and impairs colonic epithelial regeneration after injury in mice. Single-cell RNA analysis of intestinal stroma showed that the majority of Wnt-producing cells were contained in transgelin (Tagln+) and smooth muscle actin &#x3b1;2 (Acta2+) expressing populations. We genetically attenuated Wnt production from these stromal cells using Tagln-Cre and Acta2-CreER drivers, and found that blockage of Wnt release from either epithelium or Tagln+ and Acta2+ stromal cells impaired colonic epithelial healing after chemical-induced injury. Aggregated blockage of Wnt release from both epithelium and Tagln+ or Acta2+ stromal cells drastically diminished epithelial repair, increasing morbidity and mortality. These results from two uncharacterized stromal populations suggested that colonic recovery from colitis-like injury depends on multiple Wnt-producing sources.",2022,"Acta2; Colitis; Gpr177; Intestinal stem cell; Tagln; Wnt; Wntless; Wound healing; Actins; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Colitis, Ulcerative; Colon; Intestinal Mucosa; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Microfilament Proteins; Muscle Proteins; Pancreatitis-Associated Proteins; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; Stem Cells; Wnt3A Protein; Wound Healing",2

Cancer cells acquire enhanced Top2 functions to cope with the stress generated by transcription and DNA replication during rapid cell division since cancer driver genes such as Myc and EZH2 hijack Top2 in order to realize their oncogenic transcriptomes for cell growth and tumor progression. Inhibitors of Top2 are therefore designed to target Top2 to trap it on DNA, subsequently causing protein-linked DNA breaks, a halt to the cell cycle, and ultimately cell death. Despite the effectiveness of these inhibitors, cancer cells can develop resistance to them, thereby limiting their therapeutic utility. To maximize the therapeutic potential of Top2 inhibitors, combination therapies to co-target Top2 with DNA damage repair (DDR) machinery and oncogenic pathways have been proposed to induce synthetic lethality for more thorough tumor suppression. In this review, we will discuss the mode of action of Top2 inhibitors and their potential applications in cancer treatments.",2023,DNA damage repair; DNA repair inhibitors; DNA topoisomerase II; EZH2; Myc; synthetic lethality; topoisomerase inhibitors,69

Developing therapeutic strategies to cope with CSCs requires a thorough understanding of the critical drivers and molecular mechanisms underlying the aforementioned processes. One such hub regulator of stemness is Lin28, an RNA-binding protein. Lin28 blocks the synthesis of let-7, a tumour-suppressor microRNA, and acts as a global regulator of cell differentiation and proliferation. Lin28also targets messenger RNAs and regulates protein translation. In this review, we explain the role of the Lin28/let-7 axis in establishing stemness, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and glucose metabolism reprogramming.

Upon encountering protein-damaging conditions, cells activate the heat-shock response (HSR) which involves HSF1-mediated transcriptional upregulation of a group of chaperones - the heat shock proteins (HSPs). Cancer cells experience high levels of proteotoxic stress due to the production of mutated proteins, aneuploidy-induced excess of components of multiprotein complexes, increased translation rates, and dysregulated metabolism. To cope with this chronic state of proteotoxic stress, cancers almost invariably upregulate major components of HSR, including HSF1 and individual HSPs. Some oncogenic programs show dependence or coupling with a particular HSR factor (such as frequent coamplification of HSF1 and MYC genes). Elevated levels of HSPs and HSF1 are typically associated with drug resistance and poor clinical outcomes in various malignancies. The non-oncogene dependence (""addiction"") on protein quality controls represents a pancancer target in treating human malignancies, offering a potential to enhance efficacy of standard and targeted chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Here, we elucidate the role of the high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) chromatin regulator as a novel driver of MPN progression. HMGA1 is upregulated in MPN, with highest levels after transformation to MF or AML. To define HMGA1 function, we disrupted gene expression via CRISPR/Cas9, short hairpin RNA, or genetic deletion in MPN models. HMGA1 depletion in JAK2V617F AML cell lines disrupts proliferation, clonogenicity, and leukemic engraftment. Surprisingly, loss of just a single Hmga1 allele prevents progression to MF in JAK2V617F mice, decreasing erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, megakaryocyte hyperplasia, and expansion of stem and progenitors, while preventing splenomegaly and fibrosis within the spleen and BM. RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed HMGA1 transcriptional networks and chromatin occupancy at genes that govern proliferation (E2F, G2M, mitotic spindle) and cell fate, including the GATA2 master regulatory gene. Silencing GATA2 recapitulates most phenotypes observed with HMGA1 depletion, whereas GATA2 re-expression partially rescues leukemogenesis. HMGA1 transactivates GATA2 through sequences near the developmental enhancer (+9.5), increasing chromatin accessibility and recruiting active histone marks. Further, HMGA1 transcriptional networks, including proliferation pathways and GATA2, are activated in human MF and MPN leukemic transformation. Importantly, HMGA1 depletion enhances responses to the JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib, preventing MF and prolonging survival in murine models of JAK2V617F AML. These findings illuminate HMGA1 as a key epigenetic switch involved in MPN transformation and a promising therapeutic target to treat or prevent disease progression.",2022,"Animals; Cell Proliferation; Chromatin; GATA2 Transcription Factor; Gene Regulatory Networks; HMGA1a Protein; Janus Kinase 2; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Mice; Myeloproliferative Disorders; Primary Myelofibrosis",69

Polyploidy frequently arises during tissue development and repair, and in age-associated diseases, such as cancer. Its consequences are diverse and clearly different between systems. The liver is a particularly fascinating organ in that it can adapt its ploidy to the physiological and pathological context.

The advantages and disadvantages of polyploidy in mammals are not fully understood. About 30% of the hepatocytes in the human liver are polyploid. In this review, we explore the mechanisms underlying the development of polyploid cells, our current understanding of the regulation of polyploidization during development and pathophysiology and its consequences for liver function.

Chemotherapy is the first step once no active driver mutation has been discovered. Non-antitumor drugs have been found to be beneficial when used as adjuvants to chemotherapy. In this study, the additive effect and mechanism of metformin combined with pemetrexed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells were elucidated. Three NSCLC cell lines, A549, H1975, and HCC827, were used to analyze tumor cell proliferation, colony formation and the cell cycle <i>in vitro</i> when exposed to metformin alone, pemetrexed alone or their combination. We found that combination treatment in three cell lines exerted antiproliferative effects through cell cycle arrest in the S phase. An <i>ex vivo</i> chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay was used to examine the antiangiogenic effect of metformin combined with pemetrexed on vascular structure formation. We further created an A549 orthotopic xenograft model with an <i>in vivo</i> imaging system (IVIS) and explored the associated indicators involved in the tumorigenic process. The <i>in vitro</i> results showed that the combination of metformin and pemetrexed exhibited an antiproliferative effect in reducing cell viability and colony formation, the downregulation of cyclin D1 and A2 and the upregulation of CDKN1B, which are involved in the G1/S phase. For antiangiogenic effects, the combination therapy inhibited the vascular structure, as proven by the CAM assay. We elucidated that combination therapy could target VEGFA and Endoglin by RT-qPCR, ELISA and histopathological findings in an A549 orthotopic NSCLC xenograft model.

Since pheomelanin can act as an endogenous photosensitizer, people carrying MC1R polymorphisms are more susceptible to skin cancer. Here, we summarize current knowledge on the biology of MC1R beyond its ability to drive eumelanogenesis. We analyze its capacity to cope with oxidative insult and consequent DNA damage. We describe its ability to transduce through different pathways.

A myriad of therapeutic strategies is indeed available. However, the wide variability in tumor physiology, response to therapy, added to multi-drug resistance poses enormous challenges in clinical oncology. The last years have witnessed a fast-paced development of novel experimental and translational approaches to therapeutics, that supplemented with computational and theoretical advances are opening promising avenues to cope with cancer defiances. At the core of these advances, there is a strong conceptual shift from gene-centric emphasis on driver mutations in specific oncogenes and tumor suppressors-let us call that the silver bullet approach to cancer therapeutics-to a systemic, semi-mechanistic approach based on pathway perturbations and global molecular and physiological regulatory patterns-we will call this the shrapnel approach. The silver bullet approach is still the best one to follow when clonal mutations in driver genes are present in the patient, and when there are targeted therapies to tackle those. Unfortunately, due to the heterogeneous nature of tumors this is not the common case. The wide molecular variability in the mutational level often is reduced to a much smaller set of pathway-based dysfunctions as evidenced by the well-known hallmarks of cancer. In such cases ""shrapnel gunshots"" may become more effective than ""silver bullets"". Here, we will briefly present both approaches and will abound on the discussion on the state of the art of pathway-based therapeutic designs from a translational bioinformatics and computational oncology perspective.

There are two levels: CATH-B, a daily snapshot of the latest domain structures and superfamily assignments, and CATH+, with additional derived data, such as predicted sequence domains, and functionally coherent sequence subsets (Functional Families or FunFams). The latest CATH+ release, version 4.3, significantly increases coverage of structural and sequence data, with an addition of 65,351 fully-classified domains structures (+15%), providing 500 238 structural domains, and 151 million predicted sequence domains (+59%) assigned to 5481 superfamilies. The FunFam generation pipeline has been re-engineered to cope with the increased influx of data. Three times more sequences are captured in FunFams, with a concomitant increase in functional purity, information content and structural coverage. FunFam expansion increases the structural annotations provided for experimental GO terms (+59%). We also present CATH-FunVar web-pages displaying variations in protein sequences and their proximity to known or predicted functional sites.

Various forms of RNA alterations have been described in cancer, including overexpression<sup>2</sup>, altered splicing<sup>3</sup> and gene fusions<sup>4</sup>; however, it is difficult to attribute these to underlying genomic changes owing to heterogeneity among patients and tumour types, and the relatively small cohorts of patients for whom samples have been analysed by both transcriptome and whole-genome sequencing. Here we present, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive catalogue of cancer-associated gene alterations to date, obtained by characterizing tumour transcriptomes from 1,188 donors of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)<sup>5</sup>. Using matched whole-genome sequencing data, we associated several categories of RNA alterations with germline and somatic DNA alterations, and identified probable genetic mechanisms. Somatic copy-number alterations were the major drivers of variations in total gene and allele-specific expression. We identified 649 associations of somatic single-nucleotide variants with gene expression in cis, of which 68.4% involved associations with flanking non-coding regions of the gene. We found 1,900 splicing alterations associated with somatic mutations, including the formation of exons within introns in proximity to Alu elements. In addition, 82% of gene fusions were associated with structural variants, including 75 of a new class, termed 'bridged' fusions, in which a third genomic location bridges two genes. We observed transcriptomic alteration signatures that differ between cancer types and have associations with variations in DNA mutational signatures.

The mutational spectrum changes significantly throughout tumour evolution in 40% of samples. A nearly fourfold diversification of driver genes and increased genomic instability are features of later stages. Copy number alterations often occur in mitotic crises, and lead to simultaneous gains of chromosomal segments. Timing analyses suggest that driver mutations often precede diagnosis by many years, if not decades.

Information on driver genes and prognosticators in ESCC remains incomplete. The objective was to elucidate significantly mutated genes (SMGs), mutational signatures, and prognosticators in ESCC. Three MutSig algorithms (i.e. MutSigCV, MutSigCL and MutSigFN) and '20/20+' ratio-metric were employed to identify SMGs. Nonnegative matrix factorization was used to decipher mutational signatures. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, multivariate Cox and logistic regression models were applied to analyze association between mutational features and clinical parameters. We identified 26 SMGs, including 8 novel (NAV3, TENM3, PTCH1, TGFBR2, RIPK4, PBRM1, USP8 and BAP1) and 18 that have been previously reported. Three mutational signatures were identified to be prevalent in ESCC including clocklike C&gt;T at CpG, APOBEC overactive C&gt;T at TpCp[A/T], and a signature featured by T&gt;C substitution. The T&gt;C mutational signature was significantly correlated with alcohol consumption (OR: 3.59; 95% CI: 2.30-5.67; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). This alcohol consumption signature was also observed in liver cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and its mutational activity was substantially higher in samples with mutations in TP53. Survival analysis revealed that TENM3 mutations (HR: 5.54; CI: 2.68-11.45; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and TP53 hotspot mutation p.R213* (HR: 3.37; CI: 1.73-8.06; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) were significantly associated with shortened survival outcome. The association remained statistically significant after controlling for age, gender, TNM stage and tumor grade.

Inhibition of EZH2 activity is thought to be a potent treatment option for eligible cancer patients with an aberrant EZH2 expression profile, thus the indirect EZH2 inhibitor 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) is currently under evaluation for its clinical utility. Although DZNep blocks proliferation and induces apoptosis in different tumor types including lymphomas, acquired resistance to DZNep may limit its clinical application. To investigate possible mechanisms of acquired DZNep resistance in B-cell lymphomas, we generated a DZNep-resistant clone from a previously DZNep-sensitive B-cell lymphoma cell line by long-term treatment with increasing concentrations of DZNep (ranging from 200 to 2000&#x2009;nM) and compared the molecular profiles of resistant and wild-type clones. This comparison was done using molecular techniques such as flow cytometry, copy number variation assay (OncoScan and TaqMan assays), fluorescence in situ hybridization, Western blot, immunohistochemistry and metabolomics analysis. Whole exome sequencing did not indicate the acquisition of biologically meaningful single nucleotide variants. Analysis of copy number alterations, however, demonstrated among other acquired imbalances an amplification (about 30 times) of the S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (AHCY) gene in the resistant clone. AHCY is a direct target of DZNep and is critically involved in the biological methylation process, where it catalyzes the reversible hydrolysis of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine to L-homocysteine and adenosine. The amplification of the AHCY gene is paralleled by strong overexpression of AHCY at both the transcriptional and protein level, and persists upon culturing the resistant clone in a DZNep-free medium. This study reveals one possible molecular mechanism how B-cell lymphomas can acquire resistance to DZNep, and proposes AHCY as a potential biomarker for investigation during the administration of EZH2-targeted therapy with DZNep.",2021,"3- Deazaneplanocin a (DZNep); B-cell lymphoma; Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2); S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (AHCY); Adenosine; Adenosylhomocysteinase; Apoptosis; Cell Proliferation; DNA Copy Number Variations; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein; Humans; Lymphoma, B-Cell; Tumor Cells, Cultured",1

This points to stochastic determinants, such as postzygotic mutations (PZMs) in the expanding antigen-specific autoreactive T cell lineages, by analogy to their role in the expanding tumor lineage in cancer. Using comparative genomic hybridization of DNA from pancreatic lymph-node memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of 25 diabetic NOD mice, we found lymphocyte-exclusive mosaic somatic copy-number aberrations (CNAs) with highly nonrandom independent involvement of the same gene(s) across different mice, some with an autoimmunity association (e.g., <i>Ilf3</i> and <i>Dgka</i>). We confirmed genes of interest using the gold standard approach for CNA quantification, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), as an independent method. As controls, we examined lymphocytes expanded during normal host defense (17 NOD and BALB/c mice infected with <i>Leishmania major</i> parasite). Here, CNAs found were fewer and significantly smaller compared to those in autoreactive cells (<i>P</i> = 0.0019). We determined a low T cell clonality for our samples suggesting a prethymic formation of these CNAs. In this study, we describe a novel, unexplored phenomenon of a potential causal contribution of PZMs in autoreactive T cells in T1D pathogenesis.

More than 50% of DCIS lesions are benign and will remain indolent, never progressing to invasive cancers. However, the factors that promote DCIS invasion remain poorly understood. Here, we show that SMARCE1 is required for the invasive progression of DCIS and other early-stage tumors. We show that SMARCE1 drives invasion by regulating the expression of secreted proteases that degrade basement membrane, an ECM barrier surrounding all epithelial tissues. In functional studies, SMARCE1 promotes invasion of in situ cancers growing within primary human mammary tissues and is also required for metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, SMARCE1 drives invasion by forming a SWI/SNF-independent complex with the transcription factor ILF3. In patients diagnosed with early-stage cancers, SMARCE1 expression is a strong predictor of eventual relapse and metastasis.

WGCNA was used to analyze the union of genes related to PC in NCBI and OMIM databases and the differentially expressed genes screened by TCGA-PAAD database. Samples were clustered according to gene expression in gene modules and Fisher exact method was performed. GO and KEGG were used for enrichment analysis to visually display module genes and screen driver genes. Hypergeometric test method was used to calculate pivot nodes among ncRNAs, TFs and mRNA based on RAID 2.0 and TRRUST v2 databases. The blue and yellow modules were identified as the core modules associated with PC types. MST1R, TMPRSS, MIR198, SULF1, COL1A1 and FAP were the core genes in the modules.

The Sulfs are dysregulated in many cancers with Sulf-2 in particular implicated as a driver of carcinogenesis in NSCLC, pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. This review describes the novel activity of the Sulfs in altering the sulfation pattern of HSPG chains on the outside of cells. Thereby, the Sulfs can change the binding of growth factors to these chains and can either promote (e.g., Wnt) or inhibit (e.g., fibroblast growth factor-2) signaling. The review focuses on the widespread upregulation of both Sulfs in cancers and summarizes the evidence that Sulf-2 promotes the transformed behavior of several types of cancer cells in vitro as well as their tumorigenicity in vivo.

Cellular responses to IL-6 are mediated by membrane-bound or soluble forms of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) complexed with the signal-transducing subunit gp130. While expression of the membrane-bound IL-6R is restricted to selected cell types, soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) enables gp130 engagement on all cells, a process termed IL-6 trans-signalling and considered to be pro-inflammatory. sIL-6R is predominantly generated through proteolytic processing by the metalloproteinase ADAM17. ADAM17 also liberates ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a prerequisite for EGFR activation and results in stimulation of proliferative signals. Hyperactivation of EGFR mostly due to activating mutations drives cancer development. Here, we reveal an important link between overshooting EGFR signalling and the IL-6 trans-signalling pathway. In epithelial cells, EGFR activity induces not only IL-6 expression but also the proteolytic release of sIL-6R from the cell membrane by increasing ADAM17 surface activity. We find that this derives from the transcriptional upregulation of iRhom2, a crucial regulator of ADAM17 trafficking and activation, upon EGFR engagement, which results in increased surface localization of ADAM17. Also, phosphorylation of the EGFR-downstream mediator ERK mediates ADAM17 activity via interaction with iRhom2. In sum, our study reveals an unforeseen interplay between EGFR activation and IL-6 trans-signalling, which has been shown to be fundamental in inflammation and cancer.",2023,ADAM17; EGFR; IL-6 trans-signalling; Interleukin-6; iRhom2,17

Here we investigate in non-small-cell-lung-cancer (NSCLC) cells a novel link between IR-enhanced ADAM17 activity and the non-canonical pathway of EphA2 in the cellular stress response to irradiation. Cancer cell migration in dependence of IR, EphA2, and paracrine signaling mediated by ADAM17 was determined using transwell migration assays. Changes of EphA2 pS897 and mRNA expression levels upon different ADAM17-directed treatment strategies, including the small molecular inhibitor TMI-005, the monoclonal antibody MEDI3622, and shRNAs, were mechanistically investigated. ADAM17-mediated release and cleavage of the EphA2 ligand ephrin-A1 was measured using ELISA and an acellular cleavage assay. Irradiation with 5 Gy enhanced tumor cell migration of NSCLC NCI-H358 cells in dependence of EphA2. At the same time, IR increased growth factor-induced EphA2 S897 phosphorylation <i>via</i> auto- and paracrine signaling. Genetic and pharmaceutical downregulation of ADAM17 activity abrogated growth factor (e.g. amphiregulin) release, which reduced MAPK pathway-mediated EphA2 S897 phosphorylation in an auto- and paracrine way (non-canonical EphA2-pathway) in NCI-H358 and A549 cells. These signaling processes were associated with reduced cell migration towards conditioned media derived from ADAM17-deficient cells. Interestingly, ADAM17 inhibition with the small molecular inhibitor TMI-005 led to the internalization and proteasomal degradation of EphA2, which was rescued by amphiregulin or MG-132 treatment. In addition, ADAM17 inhibition also abrogated ephrin-A1 cleavage and thereby interfered with the canonical EphA2-pathway. We identified ADAM17 and the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 as two important drivers for (IR-) induced NSCLC cell migration and described a unique interrelation between ADAM17 and EphA2. We demonstrated that ADAM17 influences both, EphA2 (pS897) and its GPI-anchored ligand ephrin-A1. Using different cellular and molecular readouts, we generated a comprehensive picture of how ADAM17 and IR influence the EphA2 canonical and non-canonical pathway in NSCLC cells.",2023,ADAM17; EphA2; Ephrin-A1; cancer cell migration; ionizing radiation,17

The reason for such resistance is not well understood, which hampers development of better therapeutic strategies. Although activating mutations in KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA are considered major drivers of CRC resistance to EGFR inhibitors, therapeutic targeting of these drug resistance drivers has not produced substantial clinical benefit. We exploited cell lines and mouse tumor models (cell line xenografts and patient derived xenografts) for experiments of genetic and pharmacologic depletion of EGFR and/or its family member HER2, including EGFR mutants, inhibition of EGFR ligand shedding, and biochemical analysis of signaling proteins, to delineate the mechanism of CRC resistance to EGFR inhibitors and to assess the therapeutic activity of PEPD<sup>G278D</sup>, which is a recombinant human protein that induces the degradation of both EGFR and HER2. The sensitivity of CRC cells to cetuximab and panitumumab correlates with the ability of these drugs to induce EGFR downregulation. PEPD<sup>G278D</sup> strongly inhibits oncogenic signaling and growth of CRC cells by causing profound depletion of EGFR and HER2, regardless of activating mutations of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA. siRNA knockdown of EGFR or HER2 also inhibits CRC cells resistant to EGFR inhibitors. Tumors harboring mutated KRAS, BRAF and/or PIK3CA also overexpress EGFR ligands, further suggesting that EGFR signaling remains important to the tumors. While excessive tumor-generated high-affinity EGFR ligands block target engagement by PEPD<sup>G278D</sup>, aderbasib, an inhibitor of ADAM10 and ADAM17, enables PEPD<sup>G278D</sup> to exert strong antitumor activity by inhibiting ligand shedding.

In this study, we aimed to reveal the role of SPAG5 in melanoma and clarify whether FOXM1 (forkhead box protein M1) /ADAM17 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17) /NOTCH1 signaling was involved. The expression of SPAG5 in malignant melanoma (MM) tissues and matched normal tissues was detected using qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Cell viability was tested using CCK-8 (Cell Count Kit-8), colony formation and EdU staining. Cell migration and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) were measured using transwell chambers and immunofluorescent staining. Cell cycle distribution and tumorigenesis were assessed by flow cytometry and in vivo tumor-bearing experiments, respectively. The results demonstrated that the expression of SPAG5 was increased in MM tissues and cells. Downregulation of SPAG5 inhibited cell viability, migration, invasion and EMT, and induced a G1-phase arrest. In addition, downregulation of SPAG5 decreased the expression of FOXM1, thereafter inhibiting the expression of ADAM17, NOTCH1 and HES1. Furthermore, deletion of SPAG5 expression decreased the tumorigenesis of MM A375 cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that SPAG5 was overexpressed in MM. Downregulation of SPAG5 repressed MM cell growth and EMT, which might be induced by inactivation of the FOXM1/ADAM17/NOTCH1 signaling.",2022,"Melanoma; Sperm-associated antigen 5; cell growth; forkhead box protein M1; migration; ADAM17 Protein; Carcinogenesis; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Down-Regulation; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Forkhead Box Protein M1; Humans; Male; Melanoma; Metalloproteases; Receptor, Notch1; Spermatozoa",17

Circulating tumor cells need to migrate through the endothelial layer of blood vessels to escape the hostile circulation and establish metastases at distant organ sites. Here, we identified the membrane-bound metalloprotease ADAM17 on endothelial cells as a key driver of metastasis. We show that TNFR1-dependent tumor cell-induced endothelial cell death, tumor cell extravasation, and subsequent metastatic seeding is dependent on the activity of endothelial ADAM17. Moreover, we reveal that ADAM17-mediated TNFR1 ectodomain shedding and subsequent processing by the &#x3b3;-secretase complex is required for the induction of TNF-induced necroptosis. Consequently, genetic ablation of ADAM17 in endothelial cells as well as short-term pharmacological inhibition of ADAM17 prevents long-term metastases formation in the lung. Thus, our data identified ADAM17 as a novel essential regulator of necroptosis and as a new promising target for antimetastatic and advanced-stage cancer therapies.",2022,"ADAM17 Protein; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Biomarkers; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Communication; Cell Death; Disease Susceptibility; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Necroptosis; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Seeding; Neoplasms; Proteolysis; Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I; Tumor Microenvironment; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",17

Interestingly, KRAS mutation coexisted (62.5%) in 10 out of 16 NRG1 fusions. In this study, we examined the role of mutant KRAS in regulating the S-N fusion protein in KRAS mutant (H358) and wild-type (Calu-3) cells. KRAS mutation-mediated increase in MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity enhanced disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)17 activity, which increased the shedding of NRG1 from the S-N fusion protein. The cleavage of NRG1 also increased the phosphorylation of ERBB2-ERBB3 heterocomplex receptors and their downstream signalling pathways, including PI3K/Akt/mTOR, even under activated KRAS mutation signalling. The concurrence of S-N fusion and KRAS mutation synergistically increased cell proliferation, colony formation, tumour growth, and the cells' resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors more than KRAS mutation alone. Targeted inhibition of MEK1/2, and ADAM17 significantly induced apoptosis singly and when combined with each mutation singly or with chemotherapy in both the concurrent KRAS mutant and S-N fusion xenograft and lung orthotopic models. Taken together, this is the first study to report that KRAS mutation increased NRG1 cleavage from the S-N fusion protein through ADAM17, thereby enhancing the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and ERBB/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. Moreover, the coexistence of KRAS mutant and S-N fusion in lung tumours renders them vulnerable to MEK1/2 and/or ADAM17 inhibitors, at least in part, due to their dependency on the strong positive loop between KRAS mutation and S-N fusion.",2022,"ADAM17 Protein; Animals; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Neuregulin-1; Oncogenes; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Transfection",17

Although the role of ADAM17 in cancer cells has been well studied, the secreted ADAM17 effects transported via exosomes are less understood. Herein, we show that the level of exosome-derived ADAM17 is elevated in the serum of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer as well as in metastatic colorectal cancer cells. Furthermore, exosomal ADAM17 was shown to promote the migratory ability of colorectal cancer cells by cleaving the E-cadherin junction. Moreover, exosomal ADAM17 overexpression as well as RNA interference results highlighted its function as a tumor metastasis-promoting factor in colorectal cancer <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Taken together, our current work suggests that exosomal ADAM17 is involved in pre-metastatic niche formation and may be utilized as a blood-based biomarker of colorectal cancer metastasis.",2021,ADAM17; E-cadherin; colorectal cancer; exosome; liver metastasis,17

This study aimed to reveal the correlation of mutational and evolutionary traits with clinical outcomes. We applied a case-based targeted and whole exome sequencing of eleven matched primary, recurrent and metastatic samples from three OS patients characterized by different clinical behaviors in local recurrence or systematic progression pattern. Extensive OS-associated driver genes were detected including TP53, RB1, NF1, PTEN, SPEN, CDKN2A. Oncogenic signaling pathways including cell cycle, TP53, MYC, Notch, WNT, RTK-RAS and PI3K were determined. MYC amplification was observed in the patient with shortest disease-free interval. Linear, branched or mixed evolutionary models were constructed in the three OS cases. A branched evolution with limited root mutation was detected in patient with shorter survival interval. ADAM17 mutation and HEY1 amplification were identified in OS happening dedifferentiation. Signatures 21 associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) was identified in OS patient with extra-pulmonary metastases. OS was characterized by complex genomic alterations. MYC aberration, limited root mutations, and a branched evolutionary model were observed in OS patient with relatively aggressive course. Extra-pulmonary metastases of OS might attribute to distinct mutational process pertaining to MSI.

Previously, we could show that CUX1 acts as an important mediator of tumor cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cell lines. However, in vivo evidence for its impact on pancreatic carcinogenesis, isoform-specific effects and downstream signaling cascades are missing. We crossbred two different CUX1 isoform mouse models (p200 CUX1 and p110 CUX1) with KC (KrasLSL-G12D/+; Ptf1aCre/+) mice, a genetic model for pancreatic precursor lesions (PanIN). In the context of oncogenic KRASs, both mice KCCux1p200 and KCCux1p110 led to increased PanIN formation and development of invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomata (PDAC). In KCCux1p110 mice, tumor development was dramatically more accelerated, leading to formation of invasive PDAC within 4 weeks. In vitro and in vivo, we could show that CUX1 enhanced proliferation by activating MEK-ERK signaling via an upstream increase of ADAM17 protein, which in turn led to an activation of EGFR. Additionally, CUX1 further enhanced MEK-ERK activation through upregulation of the serine/threonine kinase MOS, phosphorylating MEK in a KRAS-independent manner. We identified p110 CUX1 as major driver of pancreatic cancer formation in the context of mutant KRAS. These results provide the first in vivo evidence for the importance of CUX1 in the development of pancreatic cancer, and highlight the importance of CUX1-dependent signaling pathways as potential therapeutic targets.",2021,ADAM17; CUX1; EGFR; KRAS mutation; MEK-ERK; cell proliferation; pancreatic cancer; transgenic mice,17

Pharmacological targeting of EGFR is often challenged by acquired mechanisms of resistance. Ligand-dependent mechanisms in EGFR wild-type cells rely on ligand or receptor overexpression, allowing cells to outcompete inhibitors and perpetuate signaling in an autocrine manner. Importantly, EGFR ligands are synthesized as membrane-bound precursors that must be solubilized to enable receptor-ligand interactions. The A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) is considered the main sheddase of several EGFR ligands, and a potential pharmacological target. However, its broad substrate range and ubiquitous expression complicate its therapeutic targeting. Here, we present a novel bispecific fusion protein construct consisting of the inhibitory prodomain of ADAM17 (TPD), fused to an EGFR-targeting designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin). TPD is a natural inhibitor of ADAM17, maintaining the protease in a zymogen-like form. Meanwhile, the high affinity anti-EGFR DARPin E01 binds to EGFR and inhibits ligand binding. The resulting fusion protein E01-GS-TPD retained binding ability to both molecular targets EGFR and ADAM17. The large difference in affinity for each target resulted in enrichment of the fusion protein in EGFR-positive cells compared to EGFR-negative cells, suggesting a possible application in autocrine signaling inhibition. Accordingly, E01-GS-TPD decreased migration and proliferation of EGFR-dependent cell lines with no significant increase in apoptotic cell death. Finally, inhibition of proliferation was observed through EGFR ligand-dependent mechanisms as growth inhibition was not observed in EGFR mutant or KRAS mutant cell lines. The use of bispecific proteins targeting the EGFR/ADAM17 axis could be an innovative strategy for the treatment of EGFR-dependent cancers.",2020,ADAM17; DARPins; EGFR; bispecifics,17

Increased expression of Notch ligand Jagged1 occurs in several human malignancies, including colorectal cancer, and correlates with cancer progression, poor prognosis, and recurrence. Herein, we demonstrated that Jagged1 was constitutively processed in colorectal cancer tumors with mutant Kras, which ultimately triggered intrinsic reverse signaling via its nuclear-targeted intracellular domain Jag1-ICD. This process occurred when Kras/Erk/ADAM17 signaling was switched on, demonstrating that Jagged1 is a novel target of the Kras signaling pathway. Notably, Jag1-ICD promoted tumor growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, enhancing colorectal cancer progression and chemoresistance both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. These data highlight a novel role for Jagged1 in colorectal cancer tumor biology that may go beyond its effect on canonical Notch activation and suggest that Jag1-ICD may behave as an oncogenic driver that is able to sustain tumor pathogenesis and to confer chemoresistance through a noncanonical mechanism.

NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer diagnoses, with the majority of patients presenting with lung adenocarcinoma (LAC). <i>KRAS</i> mutations are a major driver of LAC, and are closely related to cigarette smoking, unlike mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which arise in never-smokers. Although the past two decades have seen fundamental progress in the treatment and diagnosis of NSCLC, NSCLC still is predominantly diagnosed at an advanced stage when therapeutic interventions are mostly palliative. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), also known as tumour necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF&#x3b1;)-converting enzyme (TACE), is responsible for the protease-driven shedding of more than 70 membrane-tethered cytokines, growth factors and cell surface receptors. Among these, the soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R), which drives pro-inflammatory and pro-tumourigenic IL-6 trans-signaling, along with several EGFR family ligands, are the best characterised. This large repertoire of substrates processed by ADAM17 places it as a pivotal orchestrator of a myriad of physiological and pathological processes associated with the initiation and/or progression of cancer, such as cell proliferation, survival, regeneration, differentiation and inflammation. In this review, we discuss recent research implicating ADAM17 as a key player in the development of LAC, and highlight the potential of ADAM17 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy to tackle this deadly malignancy.",2020,ADAM17; EGFR; IL-6 trans-signaling; KRAS; lung cancer; tobacco smoking,17

The pro-tumorigenic activity of ADAM17 was dependent upon its threonine phosphorylation by p38 MAPK, along with the preferential shedding of the ADAM17 substrate, IL-6R, to release soluble IL-6R that drives IL-6 trans-signaling via the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway. The requirement for ADAM17 in <i>Kras</i><sup>G12D</sup>-driven LAC was independent of bone marrow-derived immune cells. Furthermore, in <i>KRAS</i> mutant human LAC, there was a significant positive correlation between augmented phospho-ADAM17 levels, observed primarily in epithelial rather than immune cells, and activation of ERK and p38 MAPK pathways.

Metastases occur in approximately 50-70% of synovial sarcoma cases with yet unknown mechanisms, which led to about 70-80% mortality rate in five years. To explore the possibilities to investigate metastatic mechanisms of synovial sarcoma, we carried out the first genome-wide search for potential genetic biomarkers and drivers associated with metastasis by comparative mutational profiling of 18 synovial sarcoma samples isolated from four patients carrying the primary tumors and another four patients carrying the metastatic tumors through whole exome sequencing. Selected from the candidates yielded from this effort, we examined the effect of the multiple missense mutations of ADAM17, which were identified solely in metastatic synovial sarcoma. The mutant alleles as well as the wild-type control were expressed in the mammalian cells harboring the <i>SS18</i>-<i>SSX1</i> fusion gene. The ADAM17-P729H mutation was shown to enhance cell migration, a phenotype associated with metastasis.

EGFR is normally activated following the release of ligands such as TGF&#x3b1;, mediated by the two MMP-like proteases ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase)-10 and ADAM-17. The aim of this study was to investigate the antitumour effects of a monoclonal antibody against ADAM-17 on an in vitro model of TNBC. We investigated an inhibitory cross-domain humanised monoclonal antibody targeting both the catalytic domain and the cysteine-rich domain of ADAM17-D1(A12) in the HCC1937 and HCC1143 cell lines. D1(A12) was found to significantly inhibit the release of TGF&#x3b1;, and to decrease downstream EGFR-dependent cell signalling. D1(A12) treatment reduced proliferation in two-dimensional clonogenic assays, as well as growth in three-dimensional culture. Furthermore, D1(A12) reduced invasion of HCC1937 cells and decreased migration of HCC1143 cells. Finally, D1(A12) enhanced cell death in HCC1143 cells.

The vast majority of pituitary tumours are pituitary adenomas, also recently referred to as pituitary neuroendocrine tumours. The prevalence of clinically relevant pituitary adenomas is approximately 1 in 1000; other pituitary tumours such as craniopharyngioma and pituicytoma are comparatively very rare. This review addresses the molecular and genetic aspects of pituitary adenomas. We first discuss the germline genetic variants underlying familial pituitary tumours, which account for approximately 5% of all pituitary adenoma cases. This includes variants in established pituitary adenoma/hyperplasia predisposition genes (MEN1, PRKAR1A, AIP, CDKN1B, GPR101, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2) as well as emerging genetic associations. In addition, we discuss McCune-Albright syndrome which lies between the germline and somatic pituitary tumour genes as the causative GNAS mutations are postzygotic rather than being inherited, and the condition is associated with multiglandular features due to the involvement of different cell lines rather than being limited to the pituitary. By contrast, somatic GNAS mutations contribute to sporadic acromegaly. USP8 is the only other gene where somatic driver mutations have been established in sporadic pituitary tumorigenesis.

Since abnormally overexpression of oncogenic drivers is induced by genomic variation, we here utilized genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical prognosis data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LUAD datasets to discover novel drivers from long noncoding RNAs. We further used zebrafish models to validate the biological function of candidates in vivo. The full length of FAM83H-AS1 was obtained by rapid amplification of the cDNA ends assay. RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, quantitative mass spectrometry, and RNA sequencing assays were conducted to explore the potential mechanisms. Additionally, we used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) method and patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) model to evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting FAM83H-AS1. The results suggest that FAM83H-AS1 is a potential oncogenic driver due to chromosome 8q24 amplification. Upregulation of FAM83H-AS1 results in poor prognosis of LUAD patients in both Jiangsu Cancer Hospital (JSCH) and TCGA cohorts.

Moreover, previous studies have either used formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples or lacked paired normal tissues. We aimed to determine somatic mutations in the exomes of 76 genes, including 50 driver genes of solid cancers and NOTCH-related genes, some of which are previously reported as frequently mutated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or OSCC. We used fresh-frozen tumor/normal-paired samples from 98 treatment-na&#xef;ve Japanese patients with OSCC and analyzed their correlations with clinicopathological characteristics and survival. We identified 136 exonic mutations, including 78 non-synonymous mutations, 13 synonymous mutations, 22 nonsense mutations, 2 non-frameshift deletions, 11 frameshift deletion, and 5 each of splice-site and frameshift insertions. The most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (36.7%), FAT1 (9.2%), NOTCH1 (8.2%), CDKN2A (7.1%), ZFHX4 (5.1%), CASP8 (4.1%), EP300 (4.1%), and KMT2D (4.1%). We followed up 90 of the 98 patients for 3 years. Among them, TP53 mutation was associated with significantly shorter 3-year disease-free survival. Most of the identified TP53 mutations occurred in the DNA-binding domain and were functionally deleterious. Our findings and the mutation spectra can contribute to the development of a therapeutic strategy for Japanese patients with OSCC.",2022,"Clinical oncology; Head and neck cancer; Japanese patients; OSCC; Oral squamous cell carcinoma; Somatic mutation; Aged; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Mouth Neoplasms; Mutation",1

They may travel together with tumor cells to support their survival and aid in the formation of a metastatic niche. In this study, we aimed to study circulating CAFs (cCAFs) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in a preclinical breast tumor model in mice in order to understand the effect of chemotherapy on cCAFs and CTC formation. Tumors with MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor cells with/without primary human mammary fibroblasts (representing CAFs) were coinjected in SCID mice to develop tumors. We found that the tumors with CAFs grew faster than tumors without CAFs. To study the effect of the stroma on CTCs and cCAFs, we isolated cells using microsieve filtration technology and established ITGA5 as a new cCAF biomarker, which showed good agreement with the CAF markers FAP and &#x3b1;-SMA. We found that ITGA5+ cCAFs shed in the blood of mice bearing stroma-rich coinjection-based tumors, while there was no difference in CTC formation. Although treatment with liposomal doxorubicin reduced tumor growth, it increased the numbers of both cCAFs and CTCs in blood. Moreover, cCAFs and CTCs were found to form clusters in the chemotherapy-treated mice. Altogether, these findings indicate that the tumor stroma supports tumor growth and the formation of cCAFs. Furthermore, chemotherapy may exacerbate the formation of cCAFs and CTCs, which may eventually support the formation of a metastasis niche in breast cancer.",2023,circulating cancer-associated fibroblasts; circulating tumor cells; metastasis; tumor microenvironment; tumor stroma,11

Here, we investigate spatially organised immune determinants of PDAC recurrence. PDACs (n=284; discovery cohort) were classified according to recurrence site as liver (n=93/33%), lung (n=49/17%), local (n=31/11%), peritoneal (n=38/13%) and no-recurrence (n=73/26%). Spatial compartments were identified by fluorescent imaging as: pancytokeratin (PanCK)<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup> (tumour cells); CD45<sup>+</sup>PanCK<sup>-</sup> (leucocytes) and PanCK<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup> (stromal cells), followed by transcriptomic (72 genes) and proteomic analysis (51 proteins) for immune pathway targets. Results from next-generation sequencing (n=194) were integrated. Finally, 10 tumours from each group underwent immunophenotypic analysis by multiplex immunofluorescence. A validation cohort (n=109) was examined in parallel. No-recurrent PDACs show high immunogenicity, adaptive immune responses and are rich in pro-inflammatory chemokines, granzyme B and alpha-smooth muscle actin<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts. PDACs with liver and/or peritoneal recurrences display low immunogenicity, stemness phenotype and innate immune responses, whereas those with peritoneal metastases are additionally rich in FAP<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts. PDACs with local and/or lung recurrences display interferon-gamma signalling and mixed adaptive and innate immune responses, but with different leading immune cell population. Tumours with local recurrences overexpress dendritic cell markers whereas those with lung recurrences neutrophilic markers. Except the exclusive presence of <i>RNF43</i> mutations in the no-recurrence group, no genetic differences were seen. The no-recurrence group exhibited the best, whereas liver and peritoneal recurrences the poorest prognosis. Our findings demonstrate distinct inflammatory/stromal responses in each recurrence group, which might affect dissemination patterns and patient outcomes. These findings may help to inform personalised adjuvant/neoadjuvant and surveillance strategies in PDAC, including immunotherapeutic modalities.",2023,cancer immunobiology; immune response; immunohistopathology; pancreatic cancer,11

Rectal NETs are the most common NETs in gastrointestinal tract. Due to the rarity of rectal NETs in rectal cancer, the molecular features and the correlation with patient therapeutic response and prognosis have not been investigated in detail. In this review, we focused on the molecular features, potential therapeutic targets and prognosis of rectal NETs. By summarizing the relevant studies, we established the mutational landscape of rectal NETs and identified a series of large fragment variations. Driver genes including TP53, APC, KRAS, BRAF, RB1, CDKN2A and PTEN were found as the top mutated genes. Large fragment alterations mainly involved known driver genes, including APC, TP53, CCNE1, MYC, TERT, RB1 and ATM. Germline mutations of APC, MUTYH, MSH6, MLH1 and MSH2 associated with Lynch syndrome or FAP were also found in rectal NETs. The BRAF-V600E mutation was reported as an actionable target in rectal NETs, and the combined BRAF/MEK inhibitors were found to be effective targeting BRAF-V600E in advanced or metastatic NETs. The known prognostic risk factors of rectal adenocarcinoma, including a series of demographic and clinicopathological factors were also prognostic factors for rectal NETs. Furthermore, three types of markers, including genetic alterations, protein expression levels and methylation, were also suggested as prognostic factors for rectal NETs. In summary, we established the landscape of mutations and large-fragment alterations of rectal NETs, and identified potential therapeutic targets and a series of prognostic factors.

Prior in situ profiling studies of human CAFs have largely relied on scoring single markers, thus presenting a limited view of their molecular complexity. Our objective was to study the complex spatial tumor microenvironment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with multiple CAF biomarkers, identify novel CAF subsets, and explore their associations with patient outcome. Multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry was employed to spatially profile the CAF landscape in 2 population-based NSCLC cohorts (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;636) using antibodies against 4 fibroblast markers: platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA) and -beta (PDGFRB), fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#x3b1;SMA). The CAF subsets were analyzed for their correlations with mutations, immune characteristics, and clinical variables as well as overall survival. Two CAF subsets, CAF7 (PDGFRA-/PDGFRB+/FAP+/&#x3b1;SMA+) and CAF13 (PDGFRA+/PDGFRB+/FAP-/&#x3b1;SMA+), showed statistically significant but opposite associations with tumor histology, driver mutations (tumor protein p53 [TP53] and epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]), immune features (programmed death-ligand 1 and CD163), and prognosis. In patients with early stage tumors (pathological tumor-node-metastasis IA-IB), CAF7 and CAF13 acted as independent prognostic factors. Multimarker-defined CAF subsets were identified through high-content spatial profiling. The robust associations of CAFs with driver mutations, immune features, and outcome suggest CAFs as essential factors in NSCLC progression and warrant further studies to explore their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. This study also highlights multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry-based CAF profiling as a powerful tool for the discovery of clinically relevant CAF subsets.",2023,"Humans; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta; Biomarkers, Tumor; Fibroblasts; Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts; Mutation; Tumor Microenvironment",11

Three patients from two families with MSH3-associated polyposis were included. Whole exome sequencing of nine adenomas and matched normal tissue was performed. The amount of somatic variants in the MSH3-deficient adenomas and the pattern of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) was similar to sporadic adenomas, whereas the fraction of small insertions/deletions (indels) (21-42% of all small variants) was significantly higher. Interestingly, pathogenic somatic APC variants were found in all but one adenoma. The vast majority (12/13) of these were di-, tetra-, or penta-base pair (bp) deletions. The fraction of APC indels was significantly higher than that reported in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (p &lt; 0.01) or in sporadic adenomas (p &lt; 0.0001). In MSH3-deficient adenomas, the occurrence of APC indels in a repetitive sequence context was significantly higher than in FAP patients (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, the MSH3-deficient adenomas harboured one to five (recurrent) somatic variants in 13 established or candidate driver genes for early colorectal carcinogenesis, including ACVR2A and ARID genes. Our data suggest that MSH3-related colorectal carcinogenesis seems to follow the classical APC-driven pathway. In line with the specific function of MSH3 in the mismatch repair (MMR) system, we identified a characteristic APC mutational pattern in MSH3-deficient adenomas, and confirmed further driver genes for colorectal tumourigenesis.",2021,"Activin Receptors, Type II; Adenomatous Polyposis Coli; Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein; Colorectal Neoplasms; Humans; INDEL Mutation; MutS Homolog 3 Protein; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",11

Surgical treatments are limited; therefore, effective new therapies for DD are urgently required. To identify the key cellular and molecular pathways driving DD, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing, profiling the transcriptomes of 35,250 human single cells from DD, nonpathogenic fascia, and healthy dermis. We identify a DD-specific population of pathogenic PDPN<sup>+</sup>/FAP<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells displaying an elevated expression of fibrillar collagens and profibrogenic genes. In silico trajectory analysis reveals resident fibroblasts to be the source of this pathogenic population. To resolve the processes governing DD progression, genes differentially expressed during fibroblast differentiation were identified, including upregulated TNFRSF12A and transcription factor SCX. Knockdown of SCX and blockade of TNFRSF12A inhibited the proliferation and altered the profibrotic gene expression of cultured human FAP<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells, demonstrating a functional role for these genes in DD. The power of single-cell RNA sequencing is utilized to identify the major pathogenic mesenchymal subpopulations driving DD and the key molecular pathways regulating the DD-specific myofibroblast phenotype.

Here, we study FAP, PDGF&#x3b2;R and &#x3b1;-SMA fibroblast markers in a well-annotated clinical cohort of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for analyses of associations with immune cell infiltration, mutation status and survival. A well-annotated NSCLC cohort was subjected to IHC analyses of stromal expression of FAP, PDGF&#x3b2;R and &#x3b1;-SMA and of stromal CD8 density. Fibroblast markers-related measurements were analyzed with regard to potential associations with CD8 density, cancer genetic driver mutations, survival and PD-L1 expression in the whole NSCLC cohort and in subsets of patients.

WGCNA was used to analyze the union of genes related to PC in NCBI and OMIM databases and the differentially expressed genes screened by TCGA-PAAD database. Samples were clustered according to gene expression in gene modules and Fisher exact method was performed. GO and KEGG were used for enrichment analysis to visually display module genes and screen driver genes. Hypergeometric test method was used to calculate pivot nodes among ncRNAs, TFs and mRNA based on RAID 2.0 and TRRUST v2 databases. The blue and yellow modules were identified as the core modules associated with PC types. MST1R, TMPRSS, MIR198, SULF1, COL1A1 and FAP were the core genes in the modules.

In addition to colon polyps, individuals with FAP have a substantially increased risk of developing papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Little is known about the events underlying this association, and the prevalence of somatic ""second-hit"" mutations in <i>APC</i> is controversial. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Whole-genome sequencing was performed on paired thyroid tumor and normal DNA from 12 FAP patients who developed PTC. Somatic mutation profiles were compared with clinical characteristics and previously sequenced sporadic PTC cases. Germline variant profiling was performed to assess the prevalence of variants in genes previously shown to have a role in PTC predisposition. <b><i>Results:</i></b> All 12 patients harbored germline mutations in <i>APC</i>, consistent with FAP. Seven patients also had somatic mutations in <i>APC</i>, and seven patients harbored somatic mutations in <i>KMT2D</i>, which encodes a lysine methyl transferase. Mutation of these genes is extremely rare in sporadic PTCs. Notably, only two of the tumors harbored the somatic <i>BRAF</i> p.V600E mutation, which is the most common driver mutation found in sporadic PTCs. Six tumors displayed a cribriform-morular variant of PTC (PTC-CMV) histology, and all six had somatic mutations in <i>APC</i>. Additionally, nine FAP-PTC patients had rare germline variants in genes that were previously associated with thyroid carcinoma. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Our data indicate that FAP-associated PTCs typically have distinct mutations compared with sporadic PTCs. Roughly half of the thyroid cancers that arise in FAP patients have somatic ""second-hits"" in <i>APC</i>, which is associated with PTC-CMV histology. Somatic <i>BRAF</i> p.V600E variants also occur in some FAP patients, a novel finding. We speculate that in carriers of heterozygous pathogenic mutations of tumor suppressor genes such as <i>APC</i>, a cooperating second-hit somatic variant may occur in a different gene such as <i>KTM2D</i> or <i>BRAF</i>, leading to differences in phenotypes. The role of germline variance in genes other than APC (9 of the 12 patients in this series) needs further research.",2021,"APC; cribriform&#x2013;morular variant; familial adenomatous polyposis; papillary thyroid cancer; whole-genome sequencing; Adenomatous Polyposis Coli; Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein; Adult; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Germ-Line Mutation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; Thyroid Cancer, Papillary; Thyroid Neoplasms; Young Adult",11

The severity of polyposis varies substantially within families bearing the same germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor gene. The progressive step-wise accumulation of genetic events in tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes leads to oncogenic transformation, with driver alterations in the tumour protein p53 (TP53) gene playing a key role in advanced stage CRC. We analysed groups of pigs carrying a truncating mutation in APC (APC<sup>1311/+</sup>; orthologous to human APC<sup>1309/+</sup>) to study the influence of TP53 polymorphisms and expression on the frequency of polyp formation and polyp progression in early-stage FAP. Five generations of APC<sup>1311/+</sup> pigs were examined by colonoscopy for polyposis severity and development.

HCC is a multistep disease marked by various signaling alterations. A better understanding of the new molecular drivers of HCC could therefore provide an opportunity to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Ubiquitin-specific protease 44 (USP44), a member of the cysteine protease family, has been reported to play a role in many cancer types. However, its contribution to HCC development remains unknown. In the present study, we observed suppression of USP44 expression in HCC tissue. Clinicopathologic analysis further showed that low USP44 expression correlated with poorer survival and a later tumor stage in HCC, suggesting that USP44 could be a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Gain-of-function analysis <i>in vitro</i> demonstrated the importance of USP44 in HCC cell growth and G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> cell cycle arrest.

This study aimed to profile the molecular alterations of PSGTs via targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Immunohistochemistry was used to screen PSGTs in 32 patients and MAML2 and MYB rearrangements were detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization. 1021-Genepanel of targeted NGS was conducted to profile genomic mutations in all the PSGT patients. Among the 32 patients, 25 had MEC and 7 had ACC. MAML2 and MYB rearrangements were detected in 80.0% (20/25) of the MEC and 71.4% (5/7) of the ACC patients. Among the MEC patients, 10 (40.0%) had &#x2265;1 mutation, and 6 of them had 11 isolated mutations with abundance &gt;5%, namely NFE2L2, MYOD1, INPP4B, CCND2, SNTG1, HSPD1, TGFBR1, RBM10, NOTCH4, ASXL1, and PTPRD mutations. The remaining 4 patients had 9 mutations with abundance &lt;5%, namely KMT2A, PDCD11, FLT1, BRCA2, APC, SLX4, FOXP1, FGFR1, and HRAS mutations. All the ACC patients had mutations, which were enriched in 5 pathways including the PI3K and NOTCH pathways, chromatin and cytoskeleton remodeling, and DNA damage. These results explain PSGTs harbor distinct driver features of MAML2 or MYB rearrangement, accompanied with wide mutational diversity with very low rate of somatic mutation. Several important pathways, including the NOTCH and PI3K pathways, and chromatin remodeling could be targeted to improve the survival in patients with ACC.",2021,"MAML2 and MYB rearrangements; Molecular alterations; Primary pulmonary salivary gland-type tumors; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Mucoepidermoid; Forkhead Transcription Factors; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Lung Neoplasms; Minor Histocompatibility Antigens; Mutation; Nuclear Proteins; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; RNA-Binding Proteins; Repressor Proteins; Salivary Glands",14

In our study, we evaluated the NGS results of 82 melanoma patients from clinical routine in 2017. Besides determining the tumor mutational burden (TMB) and annotation of all genetic driver alterations, we investigated their potential as a predictor for resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and as a distinguishing feature between melanoma subtypes. Melanomas of unknown primary had a similar mutation pattern and TMB to cutaneous melanoma, which hints at its cutaneous origin. Besides the typical hotspot mutation in <i>BRAF</i> and <i>NRAS</i>, we frequently observed <i>CDKN2A</i> deletions. Acral and mucosal melanomas were dominated by CNV alterations affecting <i>PDGFRA</i>, <i>KIT</i>, <i>CDK4</i>, <i>RICTOR</i>, <i>CCND2</i> and <i>CHEK2</i>. Uveal melanoma often had somatic SNVs in <i>GNA11/Q</i> and amplification of <i>MYC</i> in all cases. A significantly higher incidence of <i>BRAF</i> V600 mutations and <i>EGFR</i> amplifications, <i>PTEN</i> and <i>TP53</i> deletions was found in patients with disease progression while on ICI. Thus, NGS might help to characterize melanoma subtypes more precisely and to identify possible resistance mechanisms to ICI therapy. Nevertheless, NGS based studies, including larger cohorts, are needed to support potential genetic ICI resistance mechanisms.",2020,Genome of advanced melanoma; TMB; acral; immune checkpoint inhibitors; melanoma of unknown origin; mucosal; next-generation sequencing; tumor mutation burden; uveal,14

Apart from the central role of genetic lesions, epigenetic anomalies have been identified as drivers in the development of the disease. Alterations in the DNA methylome were mapped in 52 newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) patients of six molecular subgroups and matched with loci-specific chromatin marks to define their impact on gene expression. Differential DNA methylation analysis was performed using DMAP with a &#x2265;10% increase (hypermethylation) or decrease (hypomethylation) in NDMM subgroups, compared to control samples, considered significant for all the subsequent analyses with p&lt;0.05 after adjusting for a false discovery rate. We identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) within the etiological cytogenetic subgroups of myeloma, compared to control plasma cells. Using gene expression data we identified genes that are dysregulated and correlate with DNA methylation levels, indicating a role for DNA methylation in their transcriptional control. We demonstrated that 70% of DMRs in the MM epigenome were hypomethylated and overlapped with repressive H3K27me3. In contrast, differentially expressed genes containing hypermethylated DMRs within the gene body or hypomethylated DMRs at the promoters overlapped with H3K4me1, H3K4me3, or H3K36me3 marks. Additionally, enrichment of BRD4 or MED1 at the H3K27ac enriched DMRs functioned as super-enhancers (SE), controlling the overexpression of genes or gene-cassettes. Therefore, this study presents the underlying epigenetic regulatory networks of gene expression dysregulation in NDMM patients and identifies potential targets for future therapies.",2021,"DNA methylation; epigenetics; gene regulation; myeloma; Aneuploidy; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4; Cyclin D1; Cyclin D2; DNA Methylation; DNA, Neoplasm; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenome; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Ontology; Gene Regulatory Networks; Histone Code; Histones; Humans; Multiple Myeloma; Neoplasm Proteins; Plasma Cells; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-maf; Translocation, Genetic",14

USP8 mutations are well-known driver mutations in corticotrophinomas. Differences in transcriptomic profiles between functioning and silent tumours or tumours with different USP8 status have not been investigated. Forty-eight patients (28 CD, 20 SCA) were screened for USP8 mutations with Sanger sequencing. Twenty-four patients were included in transcriptomic profiling with Ampliseq Transcriptome Human Gene Expression Core Panel. The entire patients group was included in qRT-PCR analysis of selected genes expression. Immunohistochemistry was used for visualization of selected protein. We found USP8 mutation in 15 patients with CD and 4 SCAs. USP8 mutations determine molecular profile of the tumours as showed by hierarchical clustering and identification of 1648 genes differentially expressed in USP8-mutated and USP8-wild-type tumours. Mutations affect many molecular pathways as observed in Gene Set Enrichment analysis. USP8-mutated adenomas showed higher level of POMC, CDC25A, MAPK4 but lower level of CCND2, CDK6, CDKN1B than USP8-wt tumours. Eighty-seven genes differentially expressed between CD-related adenomas and SCAs were found, including those involved in cell signalling (GLI2, DLC1, TBX2, RASSF6), cell adhesion (GJA1, CDH6), ion transport (KCNN4, KCNJ5) and GABA signalling (GABBR2, GABRD). USP8 mutations occur in functioning and silent corticotrophinomas. They have pleiotropic effect, not limited to EGFR signalling, and affect expression levels of many genes involved in different pathways.

The long noncoding RNA JPX (lncRNA JPX) on the X chromosome is an activator of X-inactive-specific transcript (XIST) and is a molecular switch for X-chromosome inactivation. However, the exact mechanism by which JPX acts in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not well studied. Here, through integrating clinical data and a series of functional experiments, we found that lncRNA JPX expression is significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues compared with that in paired adjacent normal tissues from two independent datasets and significantly associated with a poor survival and other malignant phenotypes (tumor stage, tumor volume) of NSCLC. Furthermore, we elucidated that JPX functions as an oncogene in NSCLC-promoting cell proliferation and cell migration by affecting cell-cycle progression. Mechanistically, JPX upregulates cyclin D2 (CCND2) expression in a competing endogenous RNA mechanism by interacting with miR-145-5p, thus provoking the development and progression of NSCLC. These findings reveal the mechanism of X-chromosome lncRNA JPX and its core regulatory circuitry JPX/miR-145-5p/CCND2 in the development and progression of NSCLC, which bring us closer to an understanding of the molecular drivers of NSCLC.",2020,"Animals; Apoptosis; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Cycle; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cyclin D2; Disease Progression; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; MicroRNAs; Prognosis; RNA, Long Noncoding; Survival Rate; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",14

However, the signaling pathways and driver genes involved in these disparate subtypes are ambiguous. This study integrated three cohort profile datasets, including 250 GCB samples and 250 ABC samples, to elucidate potential candidate hub genes and key pathways involved in these two subtypes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. After Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and sub-PPI network analyses were conducted using the STRING database and Cytoscape software. Subsequently, the Oncomine database and the cBioportal online tool were employed to verify the alterations and differential expression of the 8 hub genes (MME, CD44, IRF4, STAT3, IL2RA, ETV6, CCND2, and CFLAR). Gene set enrichment analysis was also employed to identify the intersection of the key pathways (JAK-STAT, FOXO, and NF-<i>&#x3ba;</i>B pathways) validated in the above analyses.

Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is an aggressive subtype with a higher rate of metastasis and poorer prognosis. The majority of ARMS tumors (80%) harbor a PAX3-FOXO1 or less commonly a PAX7-FOXO1 fusion gene. The presence of either the PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1 fusion gene foretells a poorer prognosis resulting in clinical re-classification as either fusion-positive (FP-RMS) or fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS). The PAX3/7-FOXO1 fusion genes result in the production of a rogue transcription factors that drive FP-RMS pathogenesis and block myogenic differentiation. Despite knowing the molecular driver of FP-RMS, targeted therapies have yet to make an impact for patients, highlighting the need for a greater understanding of the molecular consequences of PAX3-FOXO1 and its target genes including microRNAs. Here we show FP-RMS patient-derived xenografts and cell lines display a distinct microRNA expression pattern. We utilized both loss- and gain-of function approaches in human cell lines with knockdown of PAX3-FOXO1 in FP-RMS cell lines and expression of PAX3-FOXO1 in human myoblasts and identified microRNAs both positively and negatively regulated by the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein. We demonstrate PAX3-FOXO1 represses miR-221/222 that functions as a tumor suppressing microRNA through the negative regulation of CCND2, CDK6, and ERBB3. In contrast, miR-486-5p is transcriptionally activated by PAX3-FOXO1 and promotes FP-RMS proliferation, invasion, and clonogenic growth. Inhibition of miR-486-5p in FP-RMS xenografts decreased tumor growth, illustrating a proof of principle for future therapeutic intervention. Therefore, PAX3-FOXO1 regulates key microRNAs that may represent novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in FP-RMS.",2019,"Animals; Cell Proliferation; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Cells, Cultured; Child; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Mice; Mice, SCID; MicroRNAs; Microarray Analysis; Muscle Neoplasms; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Paired Box Transcription Factors; Rhabdomyosarcoma, Alveolar",14

Currently there is a lack of established markers to detect early neoplastic changes. We aimed to identify the copy number variations (CNVs) and the associated genes which could be potential markers for the detection of neoplasia in both ulcerative colitis-associated neoplasia (UC-CRN) and sporadic colorectal neoplasia (S-CRN). We employed array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) to identify CNVs in tissue samples of UC nonprogressor, progressor and sporadic CRC. Select genes within these CNV regions as a panel of markers were validated using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) method along with the microsatellite instability (MSI) in an independent cohort of samples. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis was also performed. Integrated analysis showed 10 overlapping CNV regions between UC-Progressor and S-CRN, with the 8q and 12p regions showing greater overlap. The qRT-PCR based panel of MYC, MYCN, CCND1, CCND2, EGFR and FNDC3A was successful in detecting neoplasia with an overall accuracy of 54% in S-CRN compared to that of 29% in UC neoplastic samples. IHC study showed that p53 and CCND1 were significantly overexpressed with an increasing frequency from pre-neoplastic to neoplastic stages. EGFR and AMACR were expressed only in the neoplastic conditions. CNVs that are common and unique to both UC-associated and sporadic colorectal neoplasm could be the key players driving carcinogenesis. Comparative analysis of CNVs provides testable driver aberrations but needs further evaluation in larger cohorts of samples.

Here we report whole-exome and deep sequencing of 30 paired oesophageal adenocarcinomas sampled before and after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Most, but not all, good responders pass through genetic bottlenecks, a feature associated with higher mutation burden pre-treatment. Some poor responders pass through bottlenecks, but re-grow by the time of surgical resection, suggesting a missed therapeutic opportunity. Cancers often show major changes in driver mutation presence or frequency after treatment, owing to outgrowth persistence or loss of sub-clones, copy number changes, polyclonality and/or spatial genetic heterogeneity. Post-therapy mutation spectrum shifts are also common, particularly C&gt;A and TT&gt;CT changes in good responders or bottleneckers. Post-treatment samples may also acquire mutations in known cancer driver genes (for example, SF3B1, TAF1 and CCND2) that are absent from the paired pre-treatment sample.

To bypass this obstacle, we have applied array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) to zebrafish embryonal rhabdomyosaroma (ERMS) and utilized cross-species comparison to rapidly identify genomic copy number aberrations and novel candidate oncogenes in human disease. Zebrafish ERMS contain small, focal regions of low-copy amplification. These same regions were commonly amplified in human disease. For example, 16 of 19 chromosomal gains identified in zebrafish ERMS also exhibited focal, low-copy gains in human disease. Genes found in amplified genomic regions were assessed for functional roles in promoting continued tumor growth in human and zebrafish ERMS--identifying critical genes associated with tumor maintenance. Knockdown studies identified important roles for Cyclin D2 (CCND2), Homeobox Protein C6 (HOXC6) and PlexinA1 (PLXNA1) in human ERMS cell proliferation. PLXNA1 knockdown also enhanced differentiation, reduced migration, and altered anchorage-independent growth. By contrast, chemical inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling reduced angiogenesis and tumor size in ERMS-bearing zebrafish. Importantly, VEGFA expression correlated with poor clinical outcome in patients with ERMS, implicating inhibitors of the VEGF pathway as a promising therapy for improving patient survival. Our results demonstrate the utility of array CGH and cross-species comparisons to identify candidate oncogenes essential for the pathogenesis of human cancer.",2014,"Animals; Comparative Genomic Hybridization; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genome, Human; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Neoplasms; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oncogenes; Rhabdomyosarcoma, Embryonal; Zebrafish",14

Of particular interest are genes involved in cell cycle pathways, which regulate cell division. We examined associations between common germline genetic variation in 13 genes involved in cell cycle control (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CDK2 [p33], CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1A [p21, Cip1], CDKN1B [p27, Kip1], CDKN2A [p16], CDKN2B [p15], CDKN2C [p18], and CDKN2D [p19]) and survival among women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer participating in the SEARCH (Studies of Epidemiology and Risk factors in Cancer Heredity) breast cancer study. DNA from up to 4,470 women was genotyped for 85 polymorphisms that tag the known common polymorphisms (minor allele frequency &gt; 0.05) in the genes. The genotypes of each polymorphism were tested for association with survival using Cox regression analysis. The rare allele of the tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2479717 is associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio = 1.26 per rare allele carried, 95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 1.42; P = 0.0001), which was not attenuated after adjusting for tumour stage, grade, and treatment. This SNP is part of a large linkage disequilibrium block, which contains CCND3, BYSL, TRFP, USP49, C6ofr49, FRS3, and PGC. We evaluated the association of survival and somatic expression of these genes in breast tumours using expression microarray data from seven published datasets. Elevated expression of the C6orf49 transcript was associated with breast cancer survival, adding biological interest to the finding. It is possible that CCND3 rs2479717, or another variant it tags, is associated with prognosis after a diagnosis of breast cancer.

Seventy-nine tag SNPs were used to evaluate 240 common SNPs found in the genes: CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1A, CDKNIB, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, CDKN2C and CDKN2D. These were genotyped in 2270 cases and 2280 controls from the Studies in Epidemiology and Risks of Cancer Heredity (SEARCH) study. Tag SNPs showing evidence of statistically significant differences between cases and controls (P &lt; 0.1) were genotyped in a further 2200 cases and 2280 controls from the same population. This approach found evidence for breast cancer-associated SNPs in four of the cell cycle genes: the cyclin CCNE1 rs997669 had an odds ratio (OR) (GG/AA) of 1.18 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.04-1.34] P = 0.003 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors-CDKN1A rs3176336: OR (TT/AA) = 1.25 (95% CI 1.11-1.42) P = 0.0026; CDKN1B rs34330: OR (TT/CC) = 1.22 (95% CI 1.02-1.47) P = 0.013 and the region of CDKN2A/2B rs3731239: OR (CC/TT) = 0.90 (95% CI 0.79-1.03) P = 0.013 and rs3218005 OR (GG/AA) = 1.55 (95% CI 1.02-2.37) P = 0.013 (P-values unadjusted for multiple testing). We were able to exclude the D-type cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, CDKN2C and CDKN2D from having any significantly associated risk with breast cancer in our study population. The combined effects of the cell cycle genes considered here provide evidence for a significant association with breast cancer risk in a global test (P-heterogeneity = 0.010, P-trend = 0.048).

Many studies have identified aberrations related to the pathogenesis and prognosis, broadly classifying neuroblastoma patients into high- and low-risk groups, but predicting tumor progression and clinical management of high-risk patients remains a big challenge. We integrate gene-level expression, array-based comparative genomic hybridization and functional gene-interaction network of 145 neuroblastoma patients to detect potential driver genes. The drivers are summarized into a driver-gene score (DGscore) for each patient, and we then validate its clinical relevance in terms of association with patient survival. Focusing on a subset of 48 clinically defined high-risk patients, we identify 193 recurrent regions of copy number alterations (CNAs), resulting in 274 altered genes whose copy-number gain or loss have parallel impact on the gene expression. Using a network enrichment analysis, we detect four common driver genes, ERCC6, HECTD2, KIAA1279, EMX2, and 66 patient-specific driver genes. Patients with high DGscore, thus carrying more copy-number-altered genes with correspondingly up- or down-regulated expression and functional implications, have worse survival than those with low DGscore (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006). Furthermore, Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis shows that, adjusted for age, tumor stage and MYCN amplification, DGscore is the only significant prognostic factor for high-risk neuroblastoma patients (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008). Integration of genomic copy number alteration, expression and functional interaction-network data reveals clinically relevant and prognostic putative driver genes in high-risk neuroblastoma patients. The identified putative drivers are potential drug targets for individualized therapy.

Here, we describe a distinct subgroup of acute leukemia with expression of myeloid, T lymphoid, and stem cell markers driven by aberrant allele-specific deregulation of <i>BCL11B</i>, a master transcription factor responsible for thymic T-lineage commitment and specification. Mechanistically, this deregulation was driven by chromosomal rearrangements that juxtapose <i>BCL11B</i> to superenhancers active in hematopoietic progenitors, or focal amplifications that generate a superenhancer from a noncoding element distal to <i>BCL11B</i>. Chromatin conformation analyses demonstrated long-range interactions of rearranged enhancers with the expressed <i>BCL11B</i> allele and association of <i>BCL11B</i> with activated hematopoietic progenitor cell <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements, suggesting BCL11B is aberrantly co-opted into a gene regulatory network that drives transformation by maintaining a progenitor state. These data support a role for ectopic <i>BCL11B</i> expression in primitive hematopoietic cells mediated by enhancer hijacking as an oncogenic driver of human lineage-ambiguous leukemia. SIGNIFICANCE: Lineage-ambiguous leukemias pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to a poorly understood molecular and cellular basis. We identify oncogenic deregulation of <i>BCL11B</i> driven by diverse structural alterations, including <i>de novo</i> superenhancer generation, as the driving feature of a subset of lineage-ambiguous leukemias that transcend current diagnostic boundaries.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2659</i>.",2022,"Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Gene Regulatory Networks; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Repressor Proteins; Transcription Factors; Tumor Suppressor Proteins",5

Genetic alterations in the DNA repair genes, protooncogenes, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifiers have been studied in the past decade using next-generation sequencing and high-resolution copy number arrays. While other genomic lesions like chromosomal rearrangements, inversions, insertions, and gene fusions have been well studied at functional level, the mechanism of generation of driver mutations in T-ALL is the subject of current investigation. Novel oncogenic mutations in the TP53, BRCA2, PTEN, IL7R, RAS, NOTCH1, ETV6, BCL11B, WT1, DNMT3A, PRC2, PHF6, USP7, KDM6A and an array of other genes disrupt the genetic and epigenetic homeostasis in T-ALL. In this review, we have summarized the mechanistic role of deleterious driver mutations in T-ALL initiation and progression. We speculate that the formation of non-B DNA structures could be one of the primary reasons for the occurrence of different genomic lesions seen in T-ALL, which warrants further investigation.

However, most existing single-cell simulators do not incorporate transcription factor-gene regulatory interactions that underlie expression dynamics. Here, we present SERGIO, a simulator of single-cell gene expression data that models the stochastic nature of transcription as well as regulation of genes by multiple transcription factors according to a user-provided gene regulatory network. SERGIO can simulate any number of cell types in steady state or cells differentiating to multiple fates. We show that datasets generated by SERGIO are statistically comparable to experimental data generated by Illumina HiSeq2000, Drop-seq, Illumina 10X chromium, and Smart-seq. We use SERGIO to benchmark several single-cell analysis tools, including GRN inference methods, and identify Tcf7, Gata3, and Bcl11b as key drivers of T&#xa0;cell differentiation by performing in silico knockout experiments.

Comprehensive molecular profiles and putative therapeutic targets of MGC remain undetermined. We subjected 16 tumour-normal tissue pairs to whole-exome sequencing (WES) and an expanded set of 52 tumour-normal tissue pairs to subsequent targeted sequencing. The latter focused on 114 genes identified by WES. Twenty-two histologically differentiated MGCs (D-MGCs) and 46 undifferentiated MGCs (U-MGCs) were analysed. Chromatin modifier genes, including ARID1A (21%), MLL2 (19%), MLL3 (15%), and KDM6A (7%), were frequently mutated (47%) in MGC. We also identified mutations in potential therapeutic target genes, including MTOR (9%), BRCA2 (9%), BRCA1 (7%), and ERBB3 (6%). RHOA mutation was detected only in 4% of U-MGCs and in no D-MGCs. MYH9 was recurrently (13%) mutated in MGC, with all these being of the U-MGC subtype (p = 0.023). Three U-MGCs harboured MYH9 nonsense mutations. MYH9 knockdown enhanced cell migration and induced intracytoplasmic mucin and cellular elongation. BCOR mutation was associated with improved survival. In U-MGCs, the MLH1 expression status and combined mutation status (TP53/BCL11B or TP53/MLL2) were prognostic factors. A comparative analysis of driver genes revealed that the mutation profile of D-MGC was similar to that of intestinal-type gastric cancer, whereas U-MGC was a distinct entity, harbouring a different mutational profile to intestinal- and diffuse-type gastric cancers.

We investigated the mutation incidence and the role of mSWI/SNF (BAF) complexes in human lung cancer. In the present study, we analyzed somatic mutations of BAF complexes and other driver mutated genes of lung carcinoma deposited in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database. BAF complexes were mutated in 282 of 803 (35.12%) lung carcinoma samples analyzed, ranking second to TP53. Significantly, BAF-mutated samples exhibited more genomic mutations than BAF wild-type ones. Moreover, a significant positive correlation existed between the BAF mutations and overall genomic mutations in these lung carcinoma samples (P&lt;0.001, Pearson's correlation analysis). Specifically, the mutant-typing of 6 BAF genes, SMARCA4, ARID2, ARID1B, BCL11A, BCL11B and BRD9 was associated with more overall mutations in the lung carcinoma samples. A mutation reporter system was developed by means of the establishment of stable cell sublines with slippage-luciferase transcript in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line, Calu-3. SMARCA4, the most frequently mutated BAF gene in lung cancer, was stably knocked down by pSUPER constructs carrying short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Mutation ratios determined from the mutation reporters of Calu-3 cells were significantly increased upon stable SMARCA4 knockdown. We demonstrated that genetic mutations of BAF complexes lead to genome instability of lung carcinoma. Therefore, BAF complexes play an important role in maintaining genome stability in human lung cancer.",2015,"Cell Line, Tumor; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; DNA Helicases; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Frequency; Genomic Instability; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Mutation Rate; Nuclear Proteins; Transcription Factors",5

Somatic driver mutations have been found in TET2, IDH2, DNMT3A, RHOA, FYN, PLCG1, and CD28, whereas germline susceptibility to AITL has to our knowledge not been studied. The homogenous Finnish population is well suited for studies on genetic predisposition. Here, we performed an exome-wide rare variant analysis in 23 AITL patients. No germline mutations were found in the driver genes, implying that they are not frequently involved in genetic AITL predisposition. Potentially pathogenic variants present in at least two patients and showing significant (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) enrichment in our sample set were found in ten genes: POLK, PRKCB, ZNF676, PRRC2B, PCDHGB6, GNL3L, TTC36, OTOG, OSGEPL1, and RASSF9. The most significantly enriched variants, causing p.Lys469Ter in a splice variant of POLK and p.Pro588His in PRKCB, are intriguing candidates as Polk deficient mice display a spontaneous mutator phenotype, whereas PRKCB was recently shown to be somatically mutated in 33% of another peripheral T-cell lymphoma, adult T-cell lymphoma.

We sought to examine a large genomic data set to comprehensively characterize non-V600 B<i>RAF</i> alterations in lung cancer. A total of 23,396 patients with lung cancer provided data to assay with comprehensive genomic profiling. Data were reviewed for predicted pathogenic <i>BRAF</i> base substitutions, short insertions and deletions, copy number changes, and rearrangements.

However, a classification of ACC based on the TIME remains unexplored. We hierarchically clustered ACC based on the enrichment levels of twenty-three immune signatures to identify its immune-specific subtypes. Furthermore, we comprehensively compared the clinical and molecular profiles between the subtypes. We identified two immune-specific subtypes of ACC: Immunity-H and Immunity-L, which had high and low immune signature scores, respectively. We demonstrated that this subtyping method was stable and reproducible by analyzing five different ACC cohorts. Compared with Immunity-H, Immunity-L had lower levels of immune cell infiltration, worse overall and disease-free survival prognosis, and higher tumor stemness, genomic instability, proliferation potential, and intratumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, the ACC driver gene <i>CTNNB1</i> was more frequently mutated in Immunity-L than in Immunity-H. Several proteins, such as mTOR, ERCC1, Akt, ACC1, Cyclin_E1, &#x3b2;-catenin, FASN, and GAPDH, were more highly expressed in Immunity-L than in Immunity-H. In contrast, p53, Syk, Lck, PREX1, and MAPK were more highly expressed in Immunity-H. Pathway and gene ontology analysis showed that the immune, stromal, and apoptosis pathways were highly enriched in Immunity-H, while the cell cycle, steroid biosynthesis, and DNA damage repair pathways were highly enriched in Immunity-L. ACC can be classified into two stable immune-related subtypes, which have significantly different antitumor responses, molecular characteristics, and clinical outcomes. This subtyping may provide clinical implications for prognostic and immunotherapeutic stratification of ACC.",2023,adrenocortical carcinoma; clustering analysis; immunological classification; steroid hormones; tumor immune microenvironment; Humans; Adrenocortical Carcinoma; Cell Cycle; Cell Division; Disease-Free Survival; Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms; Tumor Microenvironment,27

Despite being proposed as anticancer therapeutic target, the possible role of SYK in modulating local adaptive antitumor immune responses remains uncertain. Using detailed analysis of primary human tumors and in vitro models, we reveal the immunomodulatory effect of SYK protein in human solid cancer. We spatially mapped SYK kinase in tumor cells, stromal cells and tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) in 808 primary non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) from two cohorts and in 374 breast carcinomas (BCs) from two independent cohorts. We established the associations of localized SYK with clinicopathologic variables and outcomes. The immunomodulatory role of SYK on tumor cells was assessed using in vitro cytokine stimulation, transcriptomic analysis and selective SYK blockade using a small molecule inhibitor. Functional responses were assessed using cocultures of tumor cells with peripheral blood lymphocytes. T cell responses in baseline and post-treatment biopsies from patients with BC treated with a SYK inhibitor in a phase I clinical trial were also studied. Elevated tumor cell or leukocyte SYK expression was associated with high CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs and better outcome in both NSCLC and BC. Tumor cell SYK was associated with oncogenic driver mutations in EGFR or KRAS in lung adenocarcinomas and with triple negative phenotype in BC. In cultured tumor cells, SYK was upregulated by TNF&#x3b1; and required for the TNF&#x3b1;-induced proinflammatory responses and T cell activation. SYK blockade after nivolumab in a phase I clinical trial including three patients with advanced triple negative BC reduced TILs and T cell proliferation. Our work establishes the proinflammatory function of tumor cell SYK in lung and breast cancer. SYK signaling in cultured tumor cells is required for T cell activation and SYK blockade limits adaptive antitumor immune responses and tumor rejection in patients with cancer. Together, our results establish the immunomodulatory role of SYK expression in human solid tumors.

Analysis of hallmark pathways using genomic data sets revealed further differences between these populations in the WNT, TP53, and NOTCH signaling pathways. In consensus molecular subtype (CMS) analyses of the study cases, no BRAF mutations were found in the CMS1 subtype of KOCRC, which contrasts with previous findings.

35398488,SYK,10.1016/j.cellsig.2022.110331,SYK and ZAP70 kinases in autoimmunity and lymphoid malignancies.,"SYK and ZAP70 nonreceptor tyrosine kinases serve essential roles in initiating B-cell receptor (BCR) and T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling in B- and T-lymphocytes, respectively. Despite their structural and functional similarity, expression of SYK and ZAP70 is strictly separated during B- and T-lymphocyte development, the reason for which was not known. Aberrant co-expression of ZAP70 with SYK was first identified in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and is considered a biomarker of aggressive disease and poor clinical outcomes. We recently found that aberrant ZAP70 co-expression not only functions as an oncogenic driver in CLL but also in various other B-cell malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and mantle cell lymphoma. Thereby, aberrantly expressed ZAP70 redirects SYK and BCR-downstream signaling from NFAT towards activation of the PI3K-pathway. In the sole presence of SYK, pathological BCR-signaling in autoreactive or premalignant cells induces NFAT-activation and NFAT-dependent anergy and negative selection. In contrast, negative selection of pathological B-cells is subverted when ZAP70 diverts SYK from activation of NFAT towards tonic PI3K-signaling, which promotes survival instead of cell death. We discuss here how both B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases frequently evolve to harness this mechanism, highlighting the importance of developmental separation of the two kinases as an essential safeguard.",2022,"Antigen receptor signaling; B-cell malignancies; Negative selection; SYK; ZAP70; Adult; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmunity; Humans; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell; Syk Kinase; ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase",27

Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors that disrupt BCR signaling have received regulatory approvals in therapy of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). However, responses are incomplete and patients who experience BTK inhibitor therapy failure have dire outcomes. CG-806 (luxeptinib) is a dual BTK/SYK inhibitor in clinical development in hematologic malignancies. Here we investigated the pre-clinical activity of CG-806 in MCL. In vitro treatment with CG-806 thwarted survival of MCL cell lines and patient-derived MCL cells in a dose-dependent manner. CG-806 blocked BTK and SYK activation and abrogated BCR signaling. Contrary to ibrutinib, CG-806 downmodulated the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, abrogated survival of ibrutinib-resistant MCL cell lines, and partially reversed the pro-survival effects of stromal microenvironment-mimicking conditions in primary MCL cells. Dual BTK/SYK inhibition led to mitochondrial membrane depolarization accompanied by mitophagy and metabolic reprogramming toward glycolysis. In vivo studies of CG-806 demonstrated improved survival in one of the two tested aggressive MCL PDX models. While suppression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and NF&#x3ba;B signaling correlated with in vivo drug sensitivity, OxPhos and MYC transcriptional programs were upregulated in the resistant model following treatment with CG-806. BAX and NFKBIA were implicated in susceptibility to CG-806 in a whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 library screen (in a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell line). A high-throughput in vitro functional drug screen demonstrated synergy between CG-806 and Bcl-2 inhibitors. In sum, dual BTK/SYK inhibitor CG-806 disrupts BCR signaling and induces metabolic reprogramming and apoptosis in MCL. The Bcl-2 network is a key mediator of sensitivity to CG-806 and combined targeting of Bcl-2 demonstrates synergy with CG-806 warranting continued exploration in lymphoid malignancies.",2022,"Adult; Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase; Cell Line, Tumor; Humans; Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Pyrazoles; Pyrimidines; Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell; Syk Kinase; Tumor Microenvironment",27

HCK activates BTK, AKT, and ERK in MYD88Mut lymphomas. SYK, a B-cell receptor (BCR) component, is activated in MYD88Mut lymphoma cells. Although the SFK LYN serves as a trigger for SYK activation in MYD88Mut ABC DLBCL cells, LYN activity is muted in MYD88Mut Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) cells. We therefore investigated a role for HCK in mediating SYK activation. Overexpression of wild-type (WT) (HCKWT) or gatekeeper mutated (HCKThr333Met) HCK in MYD88Mut lymphoma cells triggered SYK activation. Conversely, HCK knockdown reduced p-SYK in MYD88Mut lymphoma cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that HCK was complexed with p-SYK in MYD88Mut BCWM.1 and TMD8 cells, but not in MYD88 WT Ramos cells. Rescue experiments in MYD88Mut lymphoma cells expressing HCKThr333Met led to persistent HCK and SYK activation and resistance to the HCK inhibitor A419259. Treatment of primary MYD88Mut WM cells with A419259 reduced p-HCK and p-SYK expression. Taken together, our findings show that SYK is activated by HCK in MYD88Mut B-cell lymphomas cells, broaden the prosurvival signaling generated by aberrant HCK expression in response to MYD88Mut, and help define HCK as an important therapeutic target in MYD88Mut B-cell lymphomas.",2022,"Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Humans; Lymphoma, B-Cell; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck; Syk Kinase; src-Family Kinases",27

Cure can be achieved by cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), but this procedure is associated with long-term morbidity and high relapse rates. Thus, there is a pressing need for improved therapeutic strategies and complementary biomarkers. The present study explored the molecular heterogeneity in mCRC with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), and the potential clinical implications thereof. Multi-region immunohistochemical profiling and deep targeted DNA-sequencing was performed on chemotherapy-na&#xef;ve tumours from seven patients with synchronous colorectal PC who underwent CRS and HIPEC. In total, 88 samples (5-19 per patient) were analysed, representing primary tumour, lymph node metastases, tumour deposits, PC and liver metastases. Expression of special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2), a marker of colorectal lineage, was lacking in the majority of cases, and a conspicuous intra-patient heterogeneity was denoted for expression of the proposed prognostic and predictive biomarker RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3). Loss of mismatch repair proteins MLH1 and PSM2, observed in one case, was concordant with microsatellite instability and the highest tumour mutational burden. When present in a patient, mutations in key CRC driver genes, i.e., KRAS, APC and TP53, were homogenously distributed across all samples, while less common mutations were more heterogenous. On the same note, copy number variations showed intra-patient as well inter-patient heterogeneity. In two out of seven cases, hierarchical clustering revealed that samples from the PC and lymph node metastases were more similar to each other than to the primary tumour. In summary, these findings should encourage additional studies addressing the potential distinctiveness of mCRC with PC, which might pave the way for improved personalized treatment of these patients.",2022,"Colorectal Neoplasms; Combined Modality Therapy; DNA Copy Number Variations; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Lymphatic Metastasis; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Peritoneal Neoplasms; Prognosis; RNA-Binding Proteins; Survival Rate",27

The serine/threonine kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) constitutes a key central regulator of metabolic pathways promoting cancer cell proliferation and survival. mTOR activity is regulated by metabolic sensors as well as by numerous factors comprising the phosphatase and tensin homolog/PI3K/AKT canonical pathway, which are often mutated in cancer. However, some cancers displaying constitutively active mTOR do not carry alterations within this canonical pathway, suggesting alternative modes of mTOR regulation. Since DEPTOR, an endogenous inhibitor of mTOR, was previously found to modulate both mTOR complexes 1 and 2, we investigated the different post-translational modification that could affect its inhibitory function. We found that tyrosine (Tyr) 289 phosphorylation of DEPTOR impairs its interaction with mTOR, leading to increased mTOR activation. Using proximity biotinylation assays, we identified SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) as a kinase involved in DEPTOR Tyr 289 phosphorylation in an ephrin (erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma) receptor-dependent manner. Altogether, our work reveals that phosphorylation of Tyr 289 of DEPTOR represents a novel molecular switch involved in the regulation of both mTOR complex 1 and mTOR complex&#xa0;2.",2021,"DEPTOR; EPHB2; mTOR; tyrosine phosphorylation; HEK293 Cells; HeLa Cells; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Phosphorylation; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Signal Transduction; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Tyrosine",27

Epigenetic modifications are responsible for silencing tumor-suppressor genes, activating oncogenic drivers, and driving therapy resistance and thus have emerged as promising targets for antineoplastic therapy in prostate cancer. In this review, we discuss the role of epigenetics in prostate cancer with a particular emphasis on clinical implications. We review how epigenetic regulators crosstalk with critical biological pathways, including androgen receptor signaling, and how these interactions dynamically control prostate cancer transcriptional profiles. Because of their potentially reversible nature, restoration of a ""normal"" epigenome could provide a basis for innovative therapeutic strategies in prostate cancer.

A central mediator of protumorigenic collagen signaling is the receptor tyrosine kinase discoid domain receptor 1 (DDR1). DDR1 is a critical driver of a mesenchymal and invasive cancer cell PDAC phenotype. Previous studies have demonstrated that genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of DDR1 reduces PDAC tumorigenesis and metastasis. Here, we investigated whether DDR1 signaling has cancer cell nonautonomous effects that promote PDAC progression and metastasis. We demonstrate that collagen-induced DDR1 activation in cancer cells is a major stimulus for CXCL5 production, resulting in the recruitment of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and subsequent cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Moreover, we have identified that collagen-induced CXCL5 production was mediated by a DDR1/PKC&#x3b8;/SYK/NF-&#x3ba;B signaling cascade.

34177947,SYK,10.3389/fimmu.2021.689472,Resistance Mutations to BTK Inhibitors Originate From the NF-&#x3ba;B but Not From the PI3K-RAS-MAPK Arm of the B Cell Receptor Signaling Pathway.,"Since the first clinical report in 2013, inhibitors of the intracellular kinase BTK (BTKi) have profoundly altered the treatment paradigm of B cell malignancies, replacing chemotherapy with targeted agents in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and Waldenstr&#xf6;m's macroglobulinemia. There are over 20 BTKi, both irreversible and reversible, in clinical development. While loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in the <i>BTK</i> gene cause the immunodeficiency X-linked agammaglobulinemia, neither inherited, nor somatic <i>BTK</i> driver mutations are known. Instead, BTKi-sensitive malignancies are addicted to BTK. BTK is activated by upstream surface receptors, especially the B cell receptor (BCR) but also by chemokine receptors, and adhesion molecules regulating B cell homing. Consequently, BTKi therapy abrogates BCR-driven proliferation and the tissue homing capacity of the malignant cells, which are being redistributed into peripheral blood. BTKi resistance can develop over time, especially in MCL and high-risk CLL patients. Frequently, resistance mutations affect the BTKi binding-site, cysteine 481, thereby reducing drug binding. Less common are gain-of-function (GoF) mutations in downstream signaling components, including phospholipase C&#x3b3;2 (PLC&#x3b3;2). In a subset of patients, mechanisms outside of the BCR pathway, related e.g. to resistance to apoptosis were described. BCR signaling depends on many proteins including SYK, BTK, PI3K; still based on the resistance pattern, BTKi therapy only selects GoF alterations in the NF-&#x3ba;B arm, whereas an inhibitor of the p110&#x3b4; subunit of PI3K instead selects resistance mutations in the RAS-MAP kinase pathway. BTK and PLC&#x3b3;2 resistance mutations highlight BTK's non-redundant role in BCR-mediated NF-&#x3ba;B activation. Of note, mutations affecting BTK tend to generate clone sizes larger than alterations in PLC&#x3b3;2. This infers that BTK signaling may go beyond the PLC&#x3b3;2-regulated NF-&#x3ba;B and NFAT arms.

The T cell receptor (TCR) is emerging as a key driver of T lymphocyte transformation. However, the role of chronic TCR activation in lymphomagenesis and in lymphoma cell survival is still poorly understood. Using a mouse model, we report that chronic TCR stimulation drove T cell lymphomagenesis, whereas TCR signaling did not contribute to PTCL survival. The combination of kinome, transcriptome, and epigenome analyses of mouse PTCLs revealed a NK cell-like reprogramming of PTCL cells with expression of NK receptors (NKRs) and downstream signaling molecules such as Tyrobp and SYK. Activating NKRs were functional in PTCLs and dependent on SYK activity. In vivo blockade of NKR signaling prolonged mouse survival, demonstrating the addiction of PTCLs to NKRs and downstream SYK/mTOR activity for their survival. We studied a large collection of human primary samples and identified several PTCLs recapitulating the phenotype described in this model by their expression of SYK and the NKR, suggesting a similar mechanism of lymphomagenesis and establishing a rationale for clinical studies targeting such molecules.",2021,"Hematology; Immunology; Lymphomas; T cell receptor; T cells; Animals; Carcinogenesis; Cellular Reprogramming; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, p53; Humans; Killer Cells, Natural; Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Neoplasms, Experimental; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell; Receptors, Natural Killer Cell; Signal Transduction; Syk Kinase; T-Lymphocytes",27

One key viral factor in this process is latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A), which has been described as a B cell receptor (BCR) mimic promoting malignant transformation. However, how LMP2A signaling contributes to tumorigenesis remains elusive. By comparing LMP2A and BCR signaling in primary human B cells using phosphoproteomics and transcriptome profiling, we identified molecular mechanisms through which LMP2A affects B cell biology. Consistent with the literature, we found that LMP2A mimics a subset of BCR signaling events, including tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase SYK, the calcium initiation complex consisting of BLNK, BTK, and PLC&#x3b3;2, and its downstream transcription factor NFAT. However, the majority of LMP2A-induced signaling events markedly differed from those induced by BCR stimulation. These included differential phosphorylation of kinases, phosphatases, adaptor proteins, transcription factors such as nuclear factor &#x3ba;B (NF-&#x3ba;B) and TCF3, as well as widespread changes in the transcriptional output of LMP2A-expressing B cells. LMP2A affected apoptosis and cell-cycle checkpoints by dysregulating the expression of apoptosis regulators such as BCl-xL and the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma-associated protein 1 (RB1). LMP2A cooperated with MYC and mutant cyclin D3, two oncogenic drivers of Burkitt lymphoma, to promote proliferation and survival of primary human B cells by counteracting MYC-induced apoptosis and by inhibiting RB1 function, thereby promoting cell-cycle progression. Our results indicate that LMP2A is not a pure BCR mimic but rather rewires intracellular signaling in EBV-infected B cells that optimizes cell survival and proliferation, setting the stage for oncogenic transformation.",2021,"B cell receptor; Epstein&#x2013;Barr virus; lymphoma; signal transduction; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Apoptosis; B-Lymphocytes; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Humans; Membrane Proteins; NF-kappa B; NFATC Transcription Factors; Phosphorylation; Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell; Signal Transduction; Syk Kinase; Viral Matrix Proteins",27

Its role as a cancer driver is well documented in liquid tumors; however, cumulative evidence has suggested an opposite role in other tumor types. To systematically assess the expression of <i>SYK</i>, its prognostic value and epigenetic status in different cancers using bioinformatics tools. In this bioinformatics study, Oncomine database and cBioPortal were used to study the <i>SYK</i> gene expression, Kaplan-Meier plotter to study its prognostic value and MethHC to assess the <i>SYK</i> gene methylation in various cancers. From 542 unique analyses of the <i>SYK</i> gene, it was found to be overexpressed in bladder, breast and colon cancers but downregulated in leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. Compared with normal tissues, breast and brain tumors showed an overexpression of the <i>SYK</i> gene, whereas lymphoma and leukemia had lower expression. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that <i>SYK</i> expression in pancreatic, gastric, liver and lung patients were correlated with better overall survival. Using cBioPortal, prostate cancer was found to have the highest <i>SYK</i> gene mutation frequency, and the mean expression was highest in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia and thymoma. Using the MethHC database, <i>SYK</i> promoter hypermethylation was found to be significantly higher in breast, renal, liver, lung, pancreatic, prostatic, skin and stomach cancers compared with the normal tissue (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.005). The results of this study indicate the potential use of SYK as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for different type of cancers.

Molecular discordance between primary and metastatic TNBC has been observed, but the degree of biological heterogeneity has not been fully explored. Furthermore, genomic evolution through treatment is poorly understood. In this study, we aim to characterize the genomic changes between paired primary and metastatic TNBCs through transcriptomic and genomic profiling, and to identify genomic alterations which may contribute to chemotherapy resistance. Genomic alterations and mRNA expression of 10 paired primary and metastatic TNBCs were determined through targeted sequencing, microarray analysis, and RNA sequencing. Commonly mutated genes, as well as differentially expressed and co-expressed genes were identified. We further explored the clinical relevance of differentially expressed genes between primary and metastatic tumors to patient survival using large public datasets. Through gene expression profiling, we observed a shift in TNBC subtype classifications between primary and metastatic TNBCs. A panel of eight cancer driver genes (CCNE1, TPX2, ELF3, FANCL, JAK2, GSK3B, CEP76, and SYK) were differentially expressed in recurrent TNBCs, and were also overexpressed in TCGA and METABRIC. CCNE1 and TPX2 were co-overexpressed in TNBCs. DNA mutation profiling showed that multiple mutations occurred in genes comprising a number of potentially targetable pathways including PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS/MAPK, cell cycle, and growth factor receptor signaling, reaffirming the wide heterogeneity of mechanisms driving TNBC. CCNE1 amplification was associated with poor overall survival in patients with metastatic TNBC.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positivity is a feature in more than 90% of cases in malaria-endemic regions, and up to 30% elsewhere. However, the molecular features of BL have not been comprehensively evaluated when taking into account tumor EBV status or geographic origin. Through an integrative analysis of whole-genome and transcriptome data, we show a striking genome-wide increase in aberrant somatic hypermutation in EBV-positive tumors, supporting a link between EBV and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA) activity. In addition to identifying novel candidate BL genes such as <i>SIN3A</i>, <i>USP7</i>, and <i>CHD8</i>, we demonstrate that EBV-positive tumors had significantly fewer driver mutations, especially among genes with roles in apoptosis. We also found immunoglobulin variable region genes that were disproportionally used to encode clonal B-cell receptors (BCRs) in the tumors. These include IGHV4-34, known to produce autoreactive antibodies, and IGKV3-20, a feature described in other B-cell malignancies but not yet in BL. Our results suggest that tumor EBV status defines a specific BL phenotype irrespective of geographic origin, with particular molecular properties and distinct pathogenic mechanisms. The novel mutation patterns identified here imply rational use of DNA-damaging chemotherapy in some patients with BL and targeted agents such as the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in others, whereas the importance of BCR signaling in BL strengthens the potential benefit of inhibitors for PI3K, Syk, and Src family kinases among these patients.",2019,"Adolescent; Adult; Biomarkers, Tumor; Burkitt Lymphoma; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Cytidine Deaminase; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Genes, Immunoglobulin; Genome, Human; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Mutation; Phenotype; Prognosis; Transcriptome; Young Adult",27

Given that kinases may be drivers and readily actionable, we performed comprehensive multiplatform analysis of kinases in PSCC tumor and normal tissue. Fresh frozen tumors were collected from 11 patients with PSCC. After macrodissection to demarcate tumor from normal tissue, the samples underwent multiplatform analysis of kinases. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of 517 kinase genes was performed using Agilent Kinome capture and run on the Illumina MiSeq at PE150bp. The NanoString nCounter&#xae; platform analyzed the expression of 519 kinase genes. Kinase activity of tissue lysates was measured using PamStation&#xae;12 high-content phospho-peptide substrate microarray system. Network mapping was done with GeneGo MetaCore&#x2122; and upstream kinase prediction was performed with BioNavigator and the Kinexus database. Ingenuity pathway analysis was performed to integrate elevated kinase activity and gene over-expression with coexisting missense mutations at DNA level. Top pathways upregulated in both the kinase activity and gene expression platforms were PTEN, STAT3, GNRH, IL-8 and B cell receptor signaling. Potentially relevant missense mutations were seen in 176 kinase genes, with the top altered pathways overlapping with gene overexpression being GNRH, NF-kB and STAT3 signaling. ERBB2, ERBB3 and SYK were altered on NGS and also exhibited elevated kinase activity. To summarize, multiplatform comprehensive analysis of kinases discovered potential drivers of PSCC and actionable therapeutic targets.

However, the drivers of intratumoral immune tolerance are uncertain. Dectin 1 is an innate immune receptor crucial for anti-fungal immunity, but its role in sterile inflammation and oncogenesis has not been well defined. Furthermore, non-pathogen-derived ligands for dectin 1 have not been characterized. We found that dectin 1 is highly expressed on macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Dectin 1 ligation accelerated the progression of PDA in mice, whereas deletion of Clec7a-the gene encoding dectin 1-or blockade of dectin 1 downstream signaling was protective. We found that dectin 1 can ligate the lectin galectin 9 in mouse and human PDA, which results in tolerogenic macrophage programming and adaptive immune suppression. Upon disruption of the dectin 1-galectin 9 axis, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which are dispensable for PDA progression in hosts with an intact signaling axis, become reprogrammed into indispensable mediators of anti-tumor immunity.

MYC overexpression in B-NHL is associated with more aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis. Although genomic studies suggest a link between MYC overexpression and B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling molecules in B-NHL, signaling pathways essential to Myc-mediated B-cell transformation have not been fully elucidated. We utilized intracellular phospho-flow cytometry to investigate the relationship between Myc and BCR signaling in pre-malignant B cells. Utilizing the E&#x3bc;-myc mouse model, where Myc is overexpressed specifically in B cells, both basal and stimulated BCR signaling were increased in precancerous B lymphocytes from E&#x3bc;-myc mice compared with wild-type littermates. B cells overexpressing Myc displayed constitutively higher levels of activated CD79&#x3b1;, Btk, Plc&#x3b3;2 and Erk1/2. Notably, Myc-overexpressing B cells maintained elevated BCR signaling despite treatment with ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, PI3K/Akt pathway signaling was also increased in E&#x3bc;-myc B cells, and this increase was partially suppressed with ibrutinib. In addition, experiments with Btk-null B cells revealed off-target effects of ibrutinib on BCR signaling. Our data show that in pre-malignant B cells, Myc overexpression is sufficient to activate BCR and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and further enhances signaling following BCR ligation. Therefore, our results indicate that precancerous B cells have already acquired enhanced survival and growth capabilities before transformation, and that elevated MYC levels confer resistance to pharmacologic inhibitors of BCR signaling, which has significant implications for B-NHL treatment.",2017,"Adenine; Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase; Animals; B-Lymphocytes; CD79 Antigens; Cell Proliferation; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Phospholipase C gamma; Phosphorylation; Piperidines; Precancerous Conditions; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Pyrazoles; Pyrimidines; Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell; Splenic Neoplasms; Syk Kinase",27

Here we applied whole-exome sequencing to 69 samples from 11 patients to resolve the genetic architecture of subclonal diversification. Spatial genomic diversity was found in all 11 hepatocellular carcinoma cases, with 29% of driver mutations being heterogeneous, including TERT, ARID1A, NOTCH2, and STAG2. Similar with other cancer types, TP53 mutations were always shared between all tumor regions, that is, located on the ""trunk"" of the evolutionary tree. In addition, we found that variants within several drug targets such as KIT, SYK, and PIK3CA were mutated in a fully clonal manner, indicating their therapeutic potentials for hepatocellular carcinoma. Temporal dissection of mutational signatures suggested that mutagenic processes associated with exposure to aristolochic acid and aflatoxin might play a more important role in early, as opposed to late, stages of hepatocellular carcinoma development. Moreover, we observed extensive intratumoral epigenetic heterogeneity in hepatocellular carcinoma based on multiple independent analytical methods and showed that intratumoral methylation heterogeneity might play important roles in the biology of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Our results also demonstrated prominent heterogeneity of intratumoral methylation even in a stable hepatocellular carcinoma genome. Together, these findings highlight widespread intratumoral heterogeneity at both the genomic and epigenomic levels in hepatocellular carcinoma and provide an important molecular foundation for better understanding the pathogenesis of this malignancy. <i>Cancer Res; 77(9); 2255-65. &#xa9;2017 AACR</i>.",2017,"Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; DNA Copy Number Variations; DNA Mutational Analysis; Exome; Female; Genetic Heterogeneity; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Neoplasm Proteins",27

For advanced lung cancer, traditional chemotherapy and targeted therapy become difficult to solve the dilemma of further progress. In recent years, with the clinical application of immunotherapy, the therapeutic strategy of lung cancer has changed dramatically. At present, immunotherapy has shown conspicuous efficacy in NSCLC patients with high expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and high tumor mutational burden (TMB). The discovery of driver mutations brings delightful hope for targeted cancer therapy. However, it remains controversial whether immunotherapy can be used in NSCLC patients with these specific driver mutations. This article summarized the latest research progresses of immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC. We paid close attention to the relevance of various driver mutations and immunotherapy in NSCLC patients, and summarized the predictive effects of several driver mutations and immunotherapy. The mutations of KRAS, KRAS+TP53, EPHA (especially EPHA5), ZFHX3, ZFHX3+TP53, NOTCH, BRAF and LRP1B+FAT3 have potential to be used as biomarkers to predict the positive effectiveness of immunotherapy. ZFHX3, ZFHX3+TP53, STKII/LKB1+KEAP1+SMARCA4+PBRM1 mutations in LUAD patients get more positive effect in immunotherapy. While the mutations of EGFR, KEAP1, STKII/LKB1+KRAS, EML4-ALK, MET exon 14 skipping mutation, PBRM1, STKII/LKB1+KEAP1+SMARCA4+PBRM1, ERBB2, PIK3CA and RET often indicate poor benefit from immunotherapy.

However, LCLC tumors are still fairly vaguely defined at the molecular level compared to other subgroups. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> In this study, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 23 LCLC and 15 LCNEC tumor specimens. Meanwhile, data from the TCGA (586 LUADs and 511 LUSCs) and U Cologne (120 SCLCs) were analyzed and compared. <b>Results:</b> The most common driver mutations were found in <i>TP53</i> (13/23, 57%), <i>FAM135B</i> (8/23, 35%) and <i>FAT3</i> (7/23, 30%) in LCLC, while their counterparts in LCNEC were <i>TP53</i> (13/15, 87%), <i>LRP1B</i> (6/15, 40%) and <i>FAT1</i> (6/15, 40%). Notably, <i>FAM135B</i> mutations only occurred in LCLC (<i>P</i> = 0.013). Cosmic signature analysis revealed widespread defective DNA mismatch repair and tobacco-induced mutations in both LCLC and LCNEC. Additionally, LCNEC had a higher incidence of chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) and structural variations (SVs) compared with LCLC, although the differences were not statistically significant. Particularly, chromothripsis SVs was significantly associated with CNVs. Furthermore, mutational landscape of different subtypes indicated differences between subtypes, and there seems to be more commonalty between our cohort and SCLC than with other subtypes. <i>SMARCA4</i> mutations may be specific driver gene alteration in our cohort. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results support that LCLC and LCNEC tumors follow distinct tumorigenic pathways.

We performed targeted sequencing in 201 patients with ESCC to discover genetic subtypes and validate our findings via multiple data sets. We identified 3 driver genes (FCGBP, GRIN2B, and FRY), and recurrent truncating mutations in FRY impaired its tumor-suppressive function and promoted tumor proliferation. A 3-gene mutation signature (FAT1, FAT3, and FRY) recognized a molecular subtype named ""FAT/FRY"" with frequent Hippo pathway-related mutations. In multiple ESCC cohorts, the patients with the FAT/FRY subtype had poorer prognosis than did patients in the WT group. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the FAT/FRY subtype was characterized by inactivation of the Hippo pathway, hypoxia, chemoresistance, higher infiltration of CD8+ T cells and activated DCs, and a transcriptome similar to that of cancer responders. Furthermore, the 3-gene signature predicted better survival for patients treated with ICIs, partially explained by its positive correlation with the tumor mutation burden and neoantigen burden.

Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the somatic mutation landscape of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples. After the stepwise screening of high-frequency mutated genes, two genes with prominent significance, FAT3 and LRP1B, were finally screened out. Through further analysis, we discovered that the co-mutation of FAT3 and LRP1B was associated with an earlier age of onset and occurred more frequently in Black/African American. Furthermore, co-mutation defines a unique subgroup of lung adenocarcinoma that can increase tumor mutational burden (TMB), boost cytotoxicity and tumor immunogenicity, and facilitate lymphocyte infiltration. The results of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that co-mutation can influence tumorigenesis through a variety of mechanisms. More strikingly, the subset of LUAD with co-mutation of FAT3 and LRP1B exhibited significantly prolonged immunotherapy progression free survival (PFS).

It is generally believed that tumor cells must breach the mesothelium of peritoneal organs to adhere to the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM) and initiate metastatic growth. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are only partially understood. Here, we have analyzed 52 matched samples of spheroids and solid tumor masses (suspected primary lesions and metastases) from 10 patients by targeted sequencing of 21 loci previously proposed as targets of HGSC driver mutations. This analysis revealed very similar patterns of genetic alterations in all samples. One exception was FAT3 with a strong enrichment of mutations in metastases compared with presumed primary lesions in two cases. FAT3 is a putative tumor suppressor gene that codes for an atypical cadherin, pointing a potential role in peritoneal dissemination in a subgroup of HGSC patients. By contrast, transcriptome data revealed clear and consistent differences between tumor cell spheroids from ascites and metastatic lesions, which were mirrored by the in vitro adherence of ascites-derived spheroids. The adhesion-induced transcriptional alterations in metastases and adherent cells resembled epithelial-mesenchymal transition, but surprisingly also included the upregulation of a specific subset of mesothelial genes, such as calretinin (CALB2) and podoplanin (PDPN). Consistent with this finding, calretinin staining was also observed in subsets of tumor cells in HGSC metastases, particularly at the invasive tumor edges. Intriguingly, a high expression of either CALB2 or PDPN was strongly associated with a poor clinical outcome. siRNA-mediated CALB2 silencing triggered the detachment of adherent HGSC cells in vitro and inhibited the adhesion of detached HGSC cells to collagen type I. Our data suggest that the acquisition of a mesenchymal-mesothelial phenotype contributes to cancer cell adhesion to the ECM of peritoneal organs and HGSC progression.",2021,"adhesion; calretinin; driver mutations; mesothelial cells; metastasis; ovarian cancer; podoplanin; transcriptomics; Apoptosis; Ascites; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Adhesion; Cell Line, Tumor; Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous; Disease-Free Survival; Epithelium; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Proteins; Ovarian Neoplasms; Peritoneal Neoplasms; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Spheroids, Cellular; Treatment Outcome; Up-Regulation",8

We investigated somatic mutations in the cf-DNA of 259 cancer-free individuals with a median age of 47&#x2009;years using an endogenous barcoding duplex method with an ultralow base error rate (2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10-7) and compared the variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of these mutations between the cf-DNA and the corresponding blood cell DNA. Sixty percent (155/259) of the samples showed at least one nonsynonymous mutation on either of two similar target panels covering 508 and 559 cancer-related genes. For individuals older than 50&#x2009;years of age, the positive rate increased to 76%. Most cf-DNA mutations were also present at similar VAFs in the paired blood cell DNA. The most frequently mutated genes were driver genes of hematologic malignancies, including DNMT3A, TET2, AXSL1, and JAK2. However, the other 58.4% (192/329) of the mutations were likely 'passenger mutations' of clonal hematopoiesis, including mutations in NOTCH2, FAT3, EXT2, ERBB4, and ARID2, which are driver genes of solid tumors. Hematopoietic clone-derived mutations, including 'driver mutations' and 'passenger mutations', are prevalent in the cf-DNA of both healthy individuals and cancer patients and may be a potential source of false positives in the liquid biopsy. Our results also suggest the ineffectiveness for distinguishing clonal hematopoietic mutations of low VAF (&#x2264;0.1%) from tumor-derived mutations using conventional next-generation sequencing of blood cell DNA.

To uncover mutations associated with CLL relapse, we have performed whole-exome sequencing in a discovery cohort of 61 relapsed CLL patients identifying 86 recurrently mutated genes. The variant allele fractions (VAF) of 19 genes with mutations in &#x2265;3 of 61 cases were measured in 53 paired pre- and posttreatment CLL samples sorted to purity using panel-based deep resequencing or by droplet digital PCR. We identify mutations in TP53 as the dominant subclonal gene driver of relapsed CLL often demonstrating substantial increases in VAFs. Subclonal mutations in SAMHD1 also recurrently demonstrated increased VAFs at relapse. Mutations in ATP10A, FAT3, FAM50A, and MGA, although infrequent, demonstrated enrichment in &#x2265;2 cases each. In contrast, mutations in NOTCH1, SF3B1, POT1, FBXW7, MYD88, NXF1, XPO1, ZMYM3, or CHD2 were predominantly already clonal prior to therapy indicative of a pretreatment pathogenetic driver role in CLL. Quantitative analyses of clonal dynamics uncover rising, stable, and falling clones and subclones without clear evidence that gene mutations other than in TP53 and possibly SAMHD1 are frequently selected for at CLL relapse. Data in aggregate support a provisional categorization of CLL-associated recurrently mutated genes into three classes (i) often subclonal before therapy and strongly enriched after therapy, or, (ii) mostly clonal before therapy or without further enrichments at relapse, or, (iii) subclonal before and after therapy and enriching only in sporadic cases.

In the present study, we created txr ovarian carcinoma cell lines to identify the genes involved in chemoresistance. Transcriptome analysis revealed 1,194 overexpressed genes in txr cells. Among the upregulated genes, more than 12 cryptic transcription factors were identified using MetaCore analysis (including AR, C/EBP&#x3b2;, ER&#x3b1;, HNF4&#x3b1;, c-Jun/AP-1, c-Myc, and SP-1). Notably, individual silencing of these transcription factors (except HNF4`)sensitized txr cells to taxol. The androgen receptor (AR) and its target genes were selected for further analysis. Silencing AR using RNA interference produced a 3-fold sensitization to taxol in txr cells, a response similar to that produced by silencing abcb1. AR silencing also downregulated the expression of prominent txr gene candidates (including abcb1, abcb6, abcg2, bmp5, fat3, fgfr2, h1f0, srcrb4d, and tmprss15). In contrast, AR activation using the agonist DHT upregulated expression of the target genes. Individually silencing seven out of nine (78%) AR-regulated txr genes sensitized txr cells to taxol. Inhibition of AKT and JNK cellular kinases using chemical inhibitors caused a dramatic suppression of AR expression. These results indicate that the AR represents a critical driver of gene expression involved in txr.",2016,"androgen receptor; multiple drug resistance; ovarian cancer; taxol; transcription factor; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Carcinoma; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Silencing; Humans; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Male; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oligonucleotides; Ovarian Neoplasms; Paclitaxel; Phenotype; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Prostatic Neoplasms; RNA Interference; Receptors, Androgen; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Up-Regulation",8
35284537,CLEC9A,10.21037/atm-21-6748,A novel 12-gene prognostic signature in breast cancer based on the tumor microenvironment.,"The progression of breast cancer (BC) is highly dependent on the tumor microenvironment. Inflammation, stromal cells, and the immune landscape have been identified as significant drivers of BC in multiple preclinical studies. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the predictive relevance of stromal and immune cell-associated genes in patients suffering from BC. We employed the estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) algorithm to calculate the stromal and immunological scores, which were then used to evaluate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BC samples using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Univariate analyses were conducted to identify the DEGs linked to survival in BC patients. Next, the prognostic DEGs (with a log-rank P&lt;0.05) were used to create a risk signature, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method was used to analyze and optimize the risk signature. The following formula was used to compute the prognostic risk score values: Risk score = Gene 1 * &#x3b2;1 + Gene 2 * &#x3b2;2 +&#x2026; Gene n * &#x3b2;n. The median prognostic risk score values were used to divide BC patients into the low-risk (LR) and high-risk (HR) groups. The patient samples of the validation cohort were then assessed using this formula. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the expression patterns of the different patient groups. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to determine whether there were significant variations between the groups in the evaluated gene sets. The present study revealed that DEGs linked with survival were closely associated with immunological responses. A prognostic signature was constructed that consisted of 12 genes (<i>ASCL1, BHLHE22, C1S, CLEC9A, CST7, EEF1A2, FOLR2, KLRB1, MEOX1, PEX5L, PLA2G2D,</i> and <i>PPP1R16B</i>). According to their survival, BC patients were separated into LR and HR groups using the identified 12-gene signature. The immunological status and immune cell infiltration were observed differently in the LR and HR groups. Our results provide novel insights into several microenvironment-linked genes that influence survival outcomes in patients with BC, which suggests that these genes could be candidate therapeutic targets.",2022,Breast cancer (BC); bioinformatics analyses; gene signature; tumor microenvironment (TME),2
26459350,CLEC9A,10.4049/jimmunol.1500889,Oncogenic Transformation of Dendritic Cells and Their Precursors Leads to Rapid Cancer Development in Mice.,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are powerful APCs that can induce Ag-specific adaptive immune responses and are increasingly recognized as important players in innate immunity to both infection and malignancy. Interestingly, although there are multiple described hematological malignancies, DC cancers are rarely observed in humans. Whether this is linked to the immunogenic potential of DCs, which might render them uniquely susceptible to immune control upon neoplastic transformation, has not been fully investigated. To address the issue, we generated a genetically engineered mouse model in which expression of Cre recombinase driven by the C-type lectin domain family 9, member a (Clec9a) locus causes expression of the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Kras)(G12D) oncogenic driver and deletion of the tumor suppressor p53 within developing and differentiated DCs. We show that these Clec9a(Kras-G12D) mice rapidly succumb from disease and display massive accumulation of transformed DCs in multiple organs. In bone marrow chimeras, the development of DC cancer could be induced by a small number of transformed cells and was not prevented by the presence of untransformed DCs. Notably, activation of transformed DCs did not happen spontaneously but could be induced upon stimulation. Although Clec9a(Kras-G12D) mice showed altered thymic T cell development, peripheral T cells were largely unaffected during DC cancer development. Interestingly, transformed DCs were rejected upon adoptive transfer into wild-type but not lymphocyte-deficient mice, indicating that immunological control of DC cancer is in principle possible but does not occur during spontaneous generation in Clec9a(Kras-G12D) mice. Our findings suggest that neoplastic transformation of DCs does not by default induce anti-cancer immunity and can develop unhindered by immunological barriers.",2016,"Animals; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Dendritic Cells; Lectins, C-Type; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Neoplasms, Experimental; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Rats; Receptors, Immunologic; Stem Cells",2
31553483,BANK1,10.1111/cas.14202,Driver gene alterations and activated signaling pathways toward malignant progression of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.,"Mutually exclusive KIT and PDGFRA mutations are considered to be the earliest events in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), but insufficient for their malignant progression. Herein, we aimed to identify driver genes and signaling pathways relevant to GIST progression. We investigated genetic profiles of 707 driver genes, including mutations, gene fusions, copy number gain or loss, and gene expression for 65 clinical specimens of surgically dissected GIST, consisting of six metastatic tumors and 59 primary tumors from stomach, small intestine, rectum, and esophagus. Genetic alterations included oncogenic mutations and amplification-dependent expression enhancement for oncogenes (OG), and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and expression reduction for tumor suppressor genes (TSG). We assigned activated OG and inactivated TSG to 27 signaling pathways, the activation of which was compared between malignant GIST (metastasis and high-risk GIST) and less malignant GIST (low- and very low-risk GIST). Integrative molecular profiling indicated that a greater incidence of genetic alterations of driver genes was detected in malignant GIST (96%, 22 of 23) than in less malignant GIST (73%, 24 of 33). Malignant GIST samples groups showed mutations, LOH, and aberrant expression dominantly in driver genes associated with signaling pathways of PI3K (PIK3CA, AKT1, and PTEN) and the cell cycle (RB1, CDK4, and CDKN1B). Additionally, we identified potential PI3K-related genes, the expression of which was upregulated (SNAI1 and TPX2) or downregulated (BANK1) in malignant GIST. Based on our observations, we propose that inhibition of PI3K pathway signals might potentially be an effective therapeutic strategy against malignant progression of GIST.",2019,"PI3K; driver gene; integrative molecular profiling; malignant GIST; signaling pathway; Disease Progression; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Humans; Loss of Heterozygosity; Mutation; Oncogenes; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha; Signal Transduction",1

Mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa are 2.5-fold greater than global averages. However, the region has largely been excluded from the benefits of whole genome interrogation studies. Additionally, while structural variation (SV) is highly prevalent, PCa genomic studies are still biased towards small variant interrogation. Using whole genome sequencing and best practice workflows, we performed a comprehensive analysis of SVs for 180 (predominantly Gleason score &#x2265; 8) prostate tumours derived from 115 African, 61 European and four ancestrally admixed patients. We investigated the landscape and relationship of somatic SVs in driving ethnic disparity (African versus European), with a focus on African men from southern Africa. Duplication events showed the greatest ethnic disparity, with a 1.6- (relative frequency) to 2.5-fold (count) increase in African-derived tumours. Furthermore, we found duplication events to be associated with CDK12 inactivation and MYC copy number gain, and deletion events associated with SPOP mutation. Overall, African-derived tumours were 2-fold more likely to present with a hyper-SV subtype. In addition to hyper-duplication and deletion subtypes, we describe a new hyper-translocation subtype. While we confirm a lower TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive rate in tumours from African cases (10% versus 33%), novel African-specific PCa ETS family member and TMPRSS2 fusion partners were identified, including LINC01525, FBXO7, GTF3C2, NTNG1 and YPEL5. Notably, we found 74 somatic SV hotspots impacting 18 new candidate driver genes, with CADM2, LSAMP, PTPRD, PDE4D and PACRG having therapeutic implications for African patients. In this first African-inclusive SV study for high-risk PCa, we demonstrate the power of SV interrogation for the identification of novel subtypes, oncogenic drivers and therapeutic targets. Identifying a novel spectrum of SVs in tumours derived from African patients provides a mechanism that may contribute, at least in part, to the observed ethnic disparity in advanced PCa presentation in men of African ancestry.",2022,Advanced disease; African ancestry; Chromosomal instability; Ethnic disparity; Prostate cancer; Whole genome sequencing; Black People; Carcinogenesis; Humans; Male; Mutation; Neoplasm Grading; Nuclear Proteins; Prostatic Neoplasms; Repressor Proteins,15
35982973,PTPRD,10.3389/fonc.2022.919118,Whole genome analysis reveals the genomic complexity in metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.,"Metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is a highly morbid disease requiring radical surgery and adjuvant therapy, which is associated with a poor prognosis. Yet, compared to other advanced malignancies, relatively little is known of the genomic landscape of metastatic CSCC. We have previously reported the mutational signatures and mutational patterns of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) regions in metastatic CSCC. However, many other genomic components (indel signatures, non-coding drivers, and structural variants) of metastatic CSCC have not been reported. To this end, we performed whole genome sequencing on lymph node metastases and blood DNA from 25 CSCC patients with regional metastases of the head and neck. We designed a multifaceted computational analysis at the whole genome level to provide a more comprehensive perspective of the genomic landscape of metastatic CSCC. In the non-coding genome, 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) regions of <i>EVC</i> (48% of specimens), <i>PPP1R1A</i> (48% of specimens), and <i>ABCA4</i> (20% of specimens) along with the tumor-suppressing long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC01003 (64% of specimens) were significantly functionally altered (Q-value &lt; 0.05) and represent potential non-coding biomarkers of CSCC. Recurrent copy number loss in the tumor suppressor gene <i>PTPRD</i> was observed. Gene amplification was much less frequent, and few genes were recurrently amplified. Single nucleotide variants driver analyses from three tools confirmed <i>TP53</i> and <i>CDKN2A</i> as recurrently mutated genes but also identified <i>C9</i> as a potential novel driver in this disease. Furthermore, indel signature analysis highlighted the dominance of ID signature 13 (ID13) followed by ID8 and ID9. ID9 has previously been shown to have no association with skin melanoma, unlike ID13 and ID8, suggesting a novel pattern of indel variation in metastatic CSCC. The enrichment analysis of various genetically altered candidates shows enrichment of ""TGF-beta regulation of extracellular matrix"" and ""cell cycle G1 to S check points."" These enriched terms are associated with genetic instability, cell proliferation, and migration as mechanisms of genomic drivers of metastatic CSCC.",2022,CSCC; UTR - Untranslated regions; cutaneous; metastases; mutations; noncoding; squamous cell carcinoma; whole genome sequencing,15

The optimal treatment strategy for each subtype remains elusive, partly due to the lack of comprehensive understanding of their molecular features. We aimed to explore differential genomic signatures in pNET subtypes and identify potential prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers. We investigated genomic profiles of 57 LCNECs, 49 SCLCs, 18 TCs, and 24 ACs by sequencing tumor tissues with a 520-gene panel and explored the associations between genomic features and prognosis. Both LCNEC and SCLC displayed higher mutation rates for TP53, PRKDC, SPTA1, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and PTPRD than TC and AC. Small cell lung carcinoma harbored more frequent co-alterations in TP53-RB1, alterations in PIK3CA and SOX2, and mutations in HIF-1, VEGF and Notch pathways. Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (12.7 mutations/Mb) and SCLC (11.9 mutations/Mb) showed higher tumor mutational burdens than TC (2.4 mutations/Mb) and AC (7.1 mutations/Mb). 26.3% of LCNECs and 20.8% of ACs harbored alterations in classical non-small cell lung cancer driver genes. The presence of alterations in the homologous recombination pathway predicted longer progression-free survival in advanced LCNEC patients with systemic therapy (P = .005) and longer overall survival (OS) in SCLC patients with resection (P = .011). The presence of alterations in VEGF (P = .048) and estrogen (P = .018) signaling pathways both correlated with better OS in patients with resected SCLC.

Of note, the heterogeneity within each oncogenic driver-defined subgroup may be captured by co-occurring mutations, which potentially impact response/resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We analyzed the data of 1745 NSCLCs and delineated the landscape of interaction effects of common co-mutations on ICI efficacy. Particularly in nonsquamous NSCLC, KRAS mutation remarkably interacted with its co-occurring mutations in TP53, STK11, PTPRD, RBM10, and ATM. Based on single mutation-based prediction models, adding interaction terms (referred to as inter-model) improved discriminative utilities in both training and validation sets. The scores of inter-models exhibited undifferentiated effectiveness regardless of tumor mutational burden and programmed death-ligand 1, and were identified as independent predictors for ICI benefit. Our work provides novel tools for patient selection and insights into NSCLC immunobiology, and highlights the advantage and necessity of considering interactions when developing prediction algorithms for cancer therapeutics.",2022,NA,15

This study aimed to profile the molecular alterations of PSGTs via targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Immunohistochemistry was used to screen PSGTs in 32 patients and MAML2 and MYB rearrangements were detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization. 1021-Genepanel of targeted NGS was conducted to profile genomic mutations in all the PSGT patients. Among the 32 patients, 25 had MEC and 7 had ACC. MAML2 and MYB rearrangements were detected in 80.0% (20/25) of the MEC and 71.4% (5/7) of the ACC patients. Among the MEC patients, 10 (40.0%) had &#x2265;1 mutation, and 6 of them had 11 isolated mutations with abundance &gt;5%, namely NFE2L2, MYOD1, INPP4B, CCND2, SNTG1, HSPD1, TGFBR1, RBM10, NOTCH4, ASXL1, and PTPRD mutations.

All the ACC patients had mutations, which were enriched in 5 pathways including the PI3K and NOTCH pathways, chromatin and cytoskeleton remodeling, and DNA damage. These results explain PSGTs harbor distinct driver features of MAML2 or MYB rearrangement, accompanied with wide mutational diversity with very low rate of somatic mutation.

In this study, we investigated genetic alterations in 44 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) and 8 adenocarcinomas (EAC) from Japanese patients as potential molecular targets, based on data from the Japanese version of The Genome Atlas (JCGA). Esophageal cancer was characterized by TP53 somatic mutations in ESCC (39/44, 88.6%) and EAC (5/8, 62.5%). In addition to TP53 mutations, somatic mutations in NFE2L2 (16/44, 36.4%), CDKN2A (7/44, 15.9%), and KMT2D (7/44, 15.9%) were more frequently detected in ESCC than in EAC. WRN-truncated type mutations that lead to genomic instability correlate with EAC, but not ESCC. ESCC samples were enriched in ALDH2-associated mutational signature 16 as well as the APOBEC signature.

In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of paired circulating CLL (PB-CLL) and RS biopsies (tissue-RS) from 17 patients recruited into a clinical trial (CHOP-O). We found that tissue-RS was enriched for mutations in poor-risk CLL drivers and genes in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. In addition, we identified genomic aberrations not previously implicated in RS, including the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor (PTPRD) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3). In the noncoding genome, we discovered activation-induced cytidine deaminase-related and unrelated kataegis in tissue-RS affecting regulatory regions of key immune-regulatory genes. These include BTG2, CXCR4, NFATC1, PAX5, NOTCH-1, SLC44A5, FCRL3, SELL, TNIP2, and TRIM13. Furthermore, differences between the global mutation signatures of pairs of PB-CLL and tissue-RS samples implicate DDR as the dominant mechanism driving transformation. Pathway-based clonal deconvolution analysis showed that genes in the MAPK and DDR pathways demonstrate high clonal-expansion probability. Direct comparison of nodal-CLL and tissue-RS pairs from an independent cohort confirmed differential expression of the same pathways by RNA expression profiling. Our integrated analysis of WGS and RNA expression data significantly extends previous targeted approaches, which were limited by the lack of germline samples, and it facilitates the identification of novel genomic correlates implicated in RS transformation, which could be targeted therapeutically.

We therefore undertook an exploratory analysis to develop a genomic mutation signature (GMS) and predict the response to anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. In this multicohort analysis, 316 patients with non-squamous NSCLC treated with anti-PD-(L)1 from three independent cohorts were included in our study. Tumor samples from the patients were molecularly profiled by MSK-IMPACT or whole exome sequencing. We developed a risk model named GMS based on the MSK training cohort (n=123). The predictive model was first validated in the separate internal MSK cohort (n=82) and then validated in an external cohort containing 111 patients from previously published clinical trials. A GMS risk model consisting of eight genes (<i>TP53</i>, <i>KRAS</i>, <i>STK11</i>, <i>EGFR</i>, <i>PTPRD</i>, <i>KMT2C</i>, <i>SMAD4</i>, and <i>HGF</i>) was generated to classify patients into high and low GMS groups in the training cohort. Patients with high GMS in the training cohort had longer progression-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.41, 0.28-0.61, p<i>&lt;</i>0.0001) and overall survival (HR 0.53, 0.32-0.89, p<i>=</i>0.0275) compared with low GMS. We noted equivalent findings in the internal validation cohort and in the external validation cohort. The GMS was demonstrated as an independent predictive factor for anti-PD-(L)1 therapy comparing with tumor mutational burden. Meanwhile, GMS showed undifferentiated predictive value in patients with different clinicopathological features. Notably, both GMS and PD-L1 were independent predictors and demonstrated poorly correlated; inclusion of PD-L1 with GMS further improved the predictive capacity for PD-1 blockade immunotherapy. Our study highlights the potential predictive value of GMS for immunotherapeutic benefit in non-squamous NSCLC. Besides, the combination of GMS and PD-L1 may serve as an optimal partner in guiding treatment decisions for anti-PD-(L)1 based therapy.",2021,"biomarkers, tumor; genetic markers; immunotherapy; lung neoplasms; oncology; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cohort Studies; Female; Genomics; Humans; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors; Immunotherapy; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mutation; Progression-Free Survival",15

We therefore performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 19 matched OMM tumor/normal pairs in order to gain insight into potential genetic drivers of tumor formation. For the first time, we describe the comprehensive mutational profile of OMM. Our data suggest that the genetic background of OMM differs from those of other melanoma subtypes. We identified recurrent mutations involving KIT, POLE, PTPRD, PTCHD2, and DMXL2. Notably, copy number analysis revealed recurrently amplified regions of 12q14 (57.9%, containing CDK4) and 5p15 (47.4%, containing TERT). CNV analysis in a separate cohort of 15 samples validated the frequent CNV in CDK4 and TERT. We also observed that the melanocyte development and pigmentation signaling pathway is frequently altered in OMM. Furthermore, our data suggest several altered genes that may be amenable for targeted therapy. We identified one patient with metastatic OMM in our cohort who was identified to harbor a targetable KIT mutation using our WES results. This patient was able to achieve complete remission following implementation of KIT-targeted therapy. These findings provide further insight into the genetic underpinnings of OMM development and suggest that patients with OMM may benefit from WES analysis to identify potential targetable genetic mutations.

In the present study, we have ascertained copy number aberrations, gene fusions, gene expression patterns, and mutations in early-passage cells from ten newly established ATC cell lines using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis, RNA sequencing and whole exome sequencing. The ATC cell line genomes were highly complex and displayed signs of replicative stress and genomic instability, including massive aneuploidy and frequent breakpoints in the centromeric regions and in fragile sites. Loss of heterozygosity involving whole chromosomes was common, but there were no signs of previous near-haploidisation events or chromothripsis. A total of 21 fusion genes were detected, including six predicted in-frame fusions; none were recurrent. Global gene expression analysis showed 661 genes to be differentially expressed between ATC and papillary thyroid cancer cell lines, with pathway enrichment analyses showing downregulation of <i>TP53</i> signalling as well as cell adhesion molecules in ATC. Besides previously known driver events, such as mutations in <i>BRAF</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, <i>TP53</i> and the <i>TERT</i> promoter, we identified <i>PTPRD</i> and <i>NEGR1</i> as putative novel target genes in ATC, based on deletions in six and four cell lines, respectively; the latter gene also carried a somatic mutation in one cell line. Taken together, our data provide novel insights into the tumourigenesis of ATC and may be used to identify new therapeutic targets.",2017,"gene expression; molecular genetics; thyroid; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genetic Heterogeneity; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomic Instability; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Mutation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Thyroid Carcinoma, Anaplastic",15
28159835,PTPRD,10.1136/gutjnl-2016-312270,miR-135a-5p-mediated downregulation of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor delta is a candidate driver of HCV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis.,"HCV infection is a leading risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, even after viral clearance, HCC risk remains elevated. HCV perturbs host cell signalling to maintain infection, and derailed signalling circuitry is a key driver of carcinogenesis. Since protein phosphatases are regulators of signalling events, we aimed to identify phosphatases that respond to HCV infection with relevance for hepatocarcinogenesis. We assessed mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in primary human hepatocytes, liver biopsies and resections of patients with HCC, and analysed microarray and RNA-seq data from paired liver biopsies of patients with HCC. We revealed changes in transcriptional networks through gene set enrichment analysis and correlated phosphatase expression levels to patient survival and tumour recurrence. We demonstrate that tumour suppressor protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor delta (PTPRD) is impaired by HCV infection in vivo and in HCC lesions of paired liver biopsies independent from tissue inflammation or fibrosis. In liver tissue adjacent to tumour, high PTPRD levels are associated with a dampened transcriptional activity of STAT3, an increase of patient survival from HCC and reduced tumour recurrence after surgical resection. We identified miR-135a-5p as a mechanistic regulator of hepatic PTPRD expression in patients with HCV. We previously demonstrated that STAT3 is required for HCV infection. We conclude that HCV promotes a STAT3 transcriptional programme in the liver of patients by suppressing its regulator PTPRD via upregulation of miR-135a-5p. Our results show the existence of a perturbed PTPRD-STAT3 axis potentially driving malignant progression of HCV-associated liver disease.",2018,"HCV; HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA; SIGNALING; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blotting, Western; Carcinogenesis; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Down-Regulation; Female; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C; Hepatocytes; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; RNA, Messenger; Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 2; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Signal Transduction",15

Tobacco chewing is implicated with most of the cases of HNSCC but this type of cancer is increasing in non-tobacco chewers as well. This study was instigated to provide comprehensive variant and gene-level data in HNSCC subjects of the Indian population and fill the gap in the literature on comparative assessment of gene mutations in cancer subjects with a habit of tobacco and those without any habit using targeted amplicon sequencing. We performed targeted Amplicon sequencing of 409 tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, frequently mutated across many cancer types, including head and neck. DNA from primary tumor tissues and matched blood was analyzed for HNSCC patients with a habit of tobacco and those without any habit. PDE4DIP, SYNE1, and NOTCH1 emerged as the highly mutated genes in HNSCC. A total of 39 candidate causal variants in 22 unique cancer driver genes were identified in non-habitual (WoH) and habitual (WH) subjects. Comparison of genes from both the subjects, showed seven unique cancer driver genes (KIT, ATM, RNF213, GATA2, DST, RET, CYP2C19) in WoH, while WH showed five (IL7R, PKHD1, MLL3, PTPRD, MAPK8) and 10 genes (SETD2, ATR, CDKN2A, NCOA4, TP53, SYNE1, KAT6B, THBS1, PTPRT, and FGFR3) were common to both subjects. In addition to this NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and NOTCH4 gene were found to be mutated only in habitual subjects. These findings strongly support a causal role for tobacco, acting via PI3K and MAPK pathway inhibition and stimulation of various genes leading to oncogenic transformations in case of tobacco chewers. In case of non-tobacco chewers it appears that mutations in the pathway affecting the squamous epithelial lineage and DNA repair genes lead to HNSCC. Somatic mutation in CYP2C19 gene in the non-habitual subjects suggests that this gene may have a tobacco independent role in development and progression of HNSCC. In addition to sharing high mutation rate, NOTCH gene family was found to be mutated only in habitual sample. Further, presence of mutated genes not earlier reported to be involved in HNSCC, suggest that the Indian sub-continent may have different sets of genes, as compared to other parts of the world, involved in the development and progression of HNSCC.",2020,Amplicon sequencing; Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; Mutation; Oncogenic transformations; Tobacco,15

Significantly mutated gene analysis using 13 WGS cases and 15 additional paired extension cases identified known melanoma genes such as BRAF, NRAS, and CDKN2A, as well as a novel gene EPHA3, previously implicated in other cancer types. Extension studies using tumors from another 96 patients discovered a large number of truncation mutations in tumor suppressors (TP53 and RB1), protein phosphatases (e.g., PTEN, PTPRB, PTPRD, and PTPRT), as well as chromatin remodeling genes (e.g., ASXL3, MLL2, and ARID2). Deep sequencing of mutations revealed subclones in the majority of metastatic tumors from 13 WGS cases. Validated mutations from 12 out of 13 WGS patients exhibited a predominant UV signature characterized by a high frequency of C-&gt;T transitions occurring at the 3' base of dipyrimidine sequences while one patient (MEL9) with a hypermutator phenotype lacked this signature. Strikingly, a subclonal mutation signature analysis revealed that the founding clone in MEL9 exhibited UV signature but the secondary clone did not, suggesting different mutational mechanisms for two clonal populations from the same tumor. Further analysis of four metastases from different geographic locations in 2 melanoma cases revealed phylogenetic relationships and highlighted the genetic alterations responsible for differential drug resistance among metastatic tumors. Our study suggests that clonal evaluation is crucial for understanding tumor etiology and drug resistance in melanoma.",2016,"Base Sequence; DNA Mutational Analysis; GTP Phosphohydrolases; Genes, p16; Genome, Human; Humans; Melanoma; Membrane Proteins; Phosphoprotein Phosphatases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Receptor, EphA3; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Skin Neoplasms; Tumor Suppressor Proteins",15
24843164,PTPRD,10.1073/pnas.1401952111,Loss of the tyrosine phosphatase PTPRD leads to aberrant STAT3 activation and promotes gliomagenesis.,"PTPRD, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-&#x3b4;, is one of the most frequently inactivated genes across human cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). PTPRD undergoes both deletion and mutation in cancers, with copy number loss comprising the primary mode of inactivation in GBM. However, it is unknown whether loss of PTPRD promotes tumorigenesis in vivo, and the mechanistic basis of PTPRD function in tumors is unclear. Here, using genomic analysis and a glioma mouse model, we demonstrate that loss of Ptprd accelerates tumor formation and define the oncogenic context in which Ptprd loss acts. Specifically, we show that in human GBMs, heterozygous loss of PTPRD is the predominant type of lesion and that loss of PTPRD and the CDKN2A/p16(INK4A) tumor suppressor frequently co-occur. Accordingly, heterozygous loss of Ptprd cooperates with p16 deletion to drive gliomagenesis in mice. Moreover, loss of the Ptprd phosphatase resulted in phospho-Stat3 accumulation and constitutive activation of Stat3-driven genetic programs. Surprisingly, the consequences of Ptprd loss are maximal in the heterozygous state, demonstrating a tight dependence on gene dosage. Ptprd loss did not increase cell proliferation but rather altered pathways governing the macrophage response. In total, we reveal that PTPRD is a bona fide tumor suppressor, pinpoint PTPRD loss as a cause of aberrant STAT3 activation in gliomas, and establish PTPRD loss, in the setting of CDKN2A/p16(INK4A) deletion, as a driver of glioma progression.",2014,"Animals; Brain Neoplasms; Carcinogenesis; Cell Proliferation; Chickens; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Glioblastoma; Heterozygote; Humans; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Neoplasm Transplantation; Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 2; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Tumor Microenvironment",15

Curative treatment is based around esophagectomy, which has a major impact on quality of life. For those suitable for treatment with curative intent, 5-year survival is &#x223c;30%. More accurate prognostic tools are therefore needed, and copy number aberrations (CNAs) may offer the ability to act as prospective biomarkers in this regard. We performed a genome-wide examination of CNAs in 54 samples of EAC using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Our aims were to describe frequent regions of CNA, to define driver CNAs, and to identify CNAs that correlated with survival. Regions of frequent amplification included oncogenes such as EGFR, MYC, KLF12, and ERBB2, while frequently deleted regions included tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A/B, PTPRD, FHIT, and SMAD4. The genomic identification of significant targets in cancer (GISTIC) algorithm identified 24 regions of gain and 28 regions of loss that were likely to contain driver changes. We discovered 61 genes in five regions that, when stratified by CNA type (gain or loss), correlated with a statistically significant difference in survival. Pathway analysis of the genes residing in both the GISTIC and prognostic regions showed they were significantly enriched for cancer-related networks. Finally, we discovered that copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity is a frequent mechanism of CNA in genes currently targetable by chemotherapy, potentially leading to under-reporting of cases suitable for such treatment.",2014,"Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; DNA Copy Number Variations; Esophageal Neoplasms; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prognosis",15

Here, we use a genome-wide interference screen to determine invasion-essential genes and identify the AN1/A20 zinc finger domain containing protein 3 (ZFAND3) as a crucial driver of GBM invasion. Using patient-derived cellular models, we show that loss of ZFAND3 hampers the invasive capacity of GBM, whereas ZFAND3 overexpression increases motility in cells that were initially not invasive. At the mechanistic level, we find that ZFAND3 activity requires nuclear localization and integral zinc-finger domains. Our findings indicate that ZFAND3 acts within a nuclear protein complex to activate gene transcription and regulates the promoter of invasion-related genes such as COL6A2, FN1, and NRCAM.

Patients suffering from muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) possess dismal prognoses, while those with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) generally have a favorable outcome after local treatment. However, some NMIBCs relapse and progress to MIBC, with an unclarified mechanism. Hence, insight into the genetic drivers of BCa progression has tremendous potential benefits for precision therapeutics, risk stratification, and molecular diagnosis. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, three cohorts profile datasets (GSE13507, GSE32584, and GSE89) consisting of NMIBC and MIBC samples were integrated to address the differently expressed genes (DEGs). Subsequently, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and pathway enrichment analysis of DGEs were performed. <b>Results:</b> Six collagen members (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL5A2, COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) were up-regulated and gathered in the ECM-receptor interaction signal pathway identified by KEGG pathway analysis and GSEA. Evidence derived from the Oncomine and TCGA databases indicated that the 6 collagen genes promote the progression of BCa and are negatively associated with patient prognosis. Moreover, taking COL1A1 as a further research object, the results showed that COL1A1 was up-regulated in MIBC and its knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of 5637 and T24 cells by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and the TGF-&#x3b2; signaling pathway. <b>Conclusion:</b> With integrated bioinformatic analysis and cell experiments, we showed that 6 collagen family members are high progression risk factors and that they can be used as independent effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for BCa.",2020,bladder cancer; diagnostic marker; genomic analysis; invasion; prognostic markers,4

Here we approach this problem by linking sequence databanks to well annotated gene-chip datasets, using a multigene transcriptomic fingerprint as a link between gene mutations and gene expression in breast cancer patients. The database consists of 763 NGS samples containing mutational status for 22,938 genes and RNA-seq data for 10,987 genes. The gene chip database contains 5,934 patients with 10,987 genes plus clinical characteristics. For the prediction, mutations present in a sample are first translated into a 'transcriptomic fingerprint' by running ROC analysis on mutation and RNA-seq data. Then correlation to survival is assessed by computing Cox regression for both up- and downregulated signatures. According to this approach, the top driver oncogenes having a mutation prevalence over 5 % included AKT1, TRANK1, TRAPPC10, RPGR, COL6A2, RAPGEF4, ATG2B, CNTRL, NAA38, OSBPL10, POTEF, SCLT1, SUN1, VWDE, MTUS2, and PIK3CA, and the top tumor suppressor genes included PHEX, TP53, GGA3, RGS22, PXDNL, ARFGEF1, BRCA2, CHD8, GCC2, and ARMC4.

Some methylated genes have been proposed for cervical cancer detection; however, more reliable methylation markers are needed. To identify new hypermethylated genes in the discovery phase, we compared the methylome between a pool of DNA from normal cervical epithelium (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;19) and a pool of DNA from cervical cancer tissues (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;38) using a methylation bead array. We integrated the differentially methylated genes with public gene expression databases, which resulted in 91 candidate genes. Based on gene expression after demethylation treatment in cell lines, we confirmed 61 genes for further validation. In the validation phase, quantitative MSP and bisulfite pyrosequencing were used to examine their methylation level in an independent set of clinical samples. Fourteen genes, including ADRA1D, AJAP1, COL6A2, EDN3, EPO, HS3ST2, MAGI2, POU4F3, PTGDR, SOX8, SOX17, ST6GAL2, SYT9, and ZNF614, were significantly hypermethylated in CIN3+ lesions. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of POU4F3 for detecting CIN3+ lesions were 0.88, 0.82, and 0.85, respectively. A bioinformatics function analysis revealed that AJAP1, EDN3, EPO, MAGI2, and SOX17 were potentially implicated in &#x3b2;-catenin signaling, suggesting the epigenetic dysregulation of this signaling pathway during cervical cancer development.

Dysfunctional cytotoxic T&#xa0;cell states in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are a major cause of resistance to immunotherapy. Intratumoral myeloid cells, particularly blood-borne myeloids (bbm), are key drivers of T&#xa0;cell dysfunction in the TME. We show here that major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII)-restricted antigen presentation on bbm is essential to control the growth of brain tumors. Loss of MHCII on bbm drives dysfunctional intratumoral tumor-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T&#xa0;cell states through increased chromatin accessibility and expression of Tox, a critical regulator of T&#xa0;cell exhaustion.

The disease primarily results from loss of tumour suppressor gene function and there are no 'druggable' driver oncogenes associated with MpM. To identify opportunities for management of this disease we have carried out polysome profiling to define the MpM translatome. We show that in MpM there is a selective increase in the translation of mRNAs encoding proteins required for ribosome assembly and mitochondrial biogenesis. This results in an enhanced rate of mRNA translation, abnormal mitochondrial morphology and oxygen consumption, and a reprogramming of metabolic outputs. These alterations delimit the cellular capacity for protein biosynthesis, accelerate growth and drive disease progression. Importantly, we show that inhibition of mRNA translation, particularly through combined pharmacological targeting of mTORC1 and 2, reverses these changes and inhibits malignant cell growth in vitro and in ex-vivo tumour tissue from patients with end-stage disease. Critically, we show that these pharmacological interventions prolong survival in animal models of asbestos-induced mesothelioma, providing the basis for a targeted, viable therapeutic option for patients with this incurable disease.",2021,"Animals; Asbestos; Humans; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2; Mesothelioma, Malignant; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mitochondria; Naphthyridines; Oncogenes; Polyribosomes; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA, Messenger; Tumor Cells, Cultured",7

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an important driver of HCC. Immunotherapy has been approved for treating HCC, but biomarker-based stratification of patients for optimal response to therapy is an unmet need<sup>6,7</sup>. Here we report the progressive accumulation of exhausted, unconventionally activated CD8<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells in NASH-affected livers. In preclinical models of NASH-induced HCC, therapeutic immunotherapy targeted at programmed death-1 (PD1) expanded activated CD8<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells within tumours but did not lead to tumour regression, which indicates that tumour immune surveillance was impaired. When given prophylactically, anti-PD1 treatment led to an increase in the incidence of NASH-HCC and in the number and size of tumour nodules, which correlated with increased hepatic CD8<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup>CXCR6<sup>+</sup>, TOX<sup>+</sup>, and TNF<sup>+</sup> T cells. The increase in HCC triggered by anti-PD1 treatment was prevented by depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or TNF neutralization, suggesting that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells help to induce NASH-HCC, rather than invigorating or executing immune surveillance. We found similar phenotypic and functional profiles in hepatic CD8<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup> T cells from humans with NAFLD or NASH. A meta-analysis of three randomized phase III clinical trials that tested inhibitors of PDL1 (programmed death-ligand 1) or PD1 in more than 1,600 patients with advanced HCC revealed that immune therapy did not improve survival in patients with non-viral HCC. In two additional cohorts, patients with NASH-driven HCC who received anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 treatment showed reduced overall survival compared to patients with other aetiologies. Collectively, these data show that non-viral HCC, and particularly NASH-HCC, might be less responsive to immunotherapy, probably owing to NASH-related aberrant T cell activation causing tissue damage that leads to impaired immune surveillance.

However, the tumor microenvironment (TME) functions as a formidable barrier that severely impairs the efficacy of ICIs. While the crosstalk between tumor vessels and immune cells determines the nature of anti-tumor immunity, it is skewed toward a destructive cycle in growing tumors. First, the disorganized tumor vessels hinder CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell trafficking into the TME, disable effector functions, and even kill T cells. Moreover, VEGF, the key driver of angiogenesis, interferes with the maturation of dendritic cells, thereby suppressing T cell priming, and VEGF also induces TOX-mediated exhaustion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Meanwhile, a variety of innate and adaptive immune cells contribute to the malformation of tumor vessels. Protumoral M2-like macrophages as well as T<sub>H</sub>2 and Treg cells secrete pro-angiogenic factors that accelerate uncontrolled angiogenesis and promote vascular immaturity. While CD8<sup>+</sup> T and CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>1 cells suppress angiogenesis and induce vascular maturation by secreting IFN-&#x3b3;, they are unable to infiltrate the TME due to malformed tumor vessels. These findings led to preclinical studies that demonstrated that simultaneous targeting of tumor vessels and immunity is a viable strategy to normalize aberrant vascular-immune crosstalk and potentiate cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, this combination strategy has been evidently demonstrated through recent pivotal clinical trials, granted approval from FDA, and is now being used in patients with kidney, liver, lung, or uterine cancer.

We sought to determine if IRF4 represents a therapeutic target for ATLL and to identify downstream effectors and biomarkers of IRF4 signaling in vivo. ATLL cell lines, particularly Tax viral oncoprotein-negative cell lines, that most closely resemble ATLL in humans, were sensitive to dose- and time-dependent inhibition by a next-generation class of IRF4 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that employ constrained ethyl residues that mediate RNase H-dependent RNA degradation.

Using a wide array of functional analyses, we uncovered that TOX binds directly to KU70/80 and suppresses recruitment of this complex to DNA breaks to inhibit nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair. Impaired NHEJ is well known to cause genomic instability, including development of T-cell malignancies in KU70- and KU80-deficient mice. Collectively, our work has uncovered important roles for TOX in regulating NHEJ by elevating genomic instability during leukemia initiation and sustaining leukemic cell proliferation following transformation.<b>Significance:</b> TOX is an HMG box-containing protein that has important roles in T-ALL initiation and maintenance. TOX inhibits the recruitment of KU70/KU80 to DNA breaks, thereby inhibiting NHEJ repair. Thus, TOX is likely a dominant oncogenic driver in a large fraction of human T-ALL and enhances genomic instability. <i>Cancer Discov; 7(11); 1336-53. &#xa9;2017 AACR.</i><i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1201</i>.",2018,"Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cell Proliferation; DNA End-Joining Repair; Genomic Instability; HMGB Proteins; Humans; Ku Autoantigen; Mice; Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; T-Lymphocytes; Transcription Factors; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; Zebrafish",7
